        "Title": "Blood clots in your period: is it normal?",
        "Content": "\nWhat are blood clots during your period? Are blood clots in a period normal?\nHave you ever looked down while changing your pad and seen a red clump? Sometimes big, sometimes little?\nWell, that is a blood clot! A clot is a ball of semi-solid blood that sticks together, usually when the blood accumulates before exiting the uterus and vagina. And yes, they can be a common part of a period. But not all blood clots are normal. \nDuring our period cycle, we lose about 2-3 tablespoons of blood. If that isn’t clear enough, that is about 25 – 80 ml of blood, meaning anything over this amount is considered heavy menstrual bleeding1 . I mean who measures their bleeding this way? This is why the National Institute of Clinical Excellence has changed its definition of heavy bleeding. So if you’re worried about heavy periods and what signs to look out for, we’ve got you covered. \nBut now back to clots. Every cycle is unique, some cycles might be clottier than others. It does not always mean something is wrong. Usually, you might find clots on your pad or clinging to your tampon (or any other period product) on the heaviest day of your period, so usually in the first 3 days of your cycle. \nSome people might never see clots during their period, but that doesn’t mean anything is wrong either! \nWhat does my blood clot mean?\nJelly like clots\nJelly-like blood clots during your period, is it normal?\nJelly-like clots are generally what the blood clot chunk should look and feel like. These should be less than 2.5cm or to make things easier, the size of a 10p coin. You might see just one or maybe many clots during your period. The colour of the clots might change as the period continues: from bright red, slowly progressing to dark brown over your cycle. This is because old blood appears darker than fresh red blood 2.\nLarge clots\nSo large blood clots during a period are anything larger than a 10p coin, or to get mathematical 2.5cm3. If you are passing anything around this size or bigger, it’s time to speak to a doctor. This is generally what heavy bleeding blood clots look like. \nBlack clots\nBlack is definitely not a colour we associate with our periods. Understandably, it can be very scary to see anything black come out of your vagina. Period black blood clots are generally just very VERY old blood4 that is finally leaving the vagina. Usually, this isn’t worrying BUT if you are also experiencing very painful periods, pain during sex or chronic pelvic pain then please see a healthcare professional, as combined with black blood, these may be symptoms of endometriosis.\nOn the other hand, it might be because you have left something, like a tampon, inside your vagina for a bit longer than recommended. So you might notice some black discharge and clots forming. But you will also notice a bad smell, rash or itching from your vagina. Please see a healthcare professional if you experience this.\nClots with heavy bleeding\nA sign of heavy bleeding is passing large clots, larger than a 10p coin. People with conditions associated with heavy bleeding, such as endometriosis, fibroids or adenomyosis, do tend to see blood clots in their cycle. \nPalm-sized blood clots during period\nWell, the average palm size is about 7cm5, so a clot this size is a cause for concern. The size is simply too large and most likely means something else is going on. Please speak to a doctor! \nCould my clots mean a miscarriage?\nPregnancy is a period-free zone for 9 months! So generally, any bleeding or clots during this time might raise alarm bells. Before you freak out, sometimes women might notice some light vaginal bleeding at the start of the pregnancy which can be a sign of implantation of the fertilised egg into the wall of the womb.\nA miscarriage is pregnancy loss before 23 weeks. Your body might experience a miscarriage with bleeding, cramping and loss of pregnancy symptoms. With bleeding, you could also see clots, from small to big6.\nThe only definitive way to know if you are having a miscarriage is to have an ultrasound scan done to check the pregnancy. So please don’t freak out just yet, it might not always be bad news. Reach out to your GP or gynaecology department and get a scan booked. \nWhat next? When do I see my GP?\nIs anything off my baseline? Are my periods interfering with my daily living? Am I pregnant and bleeding? Answering yes to these questions is a good sign to get some medical advice.\nIf you’re thinking, I don’t want to talk to a doctor about my period, it’s embarrassing. Firstly it is definitely not! It is a natural human phenomenon, and we have them with pride. But if this is a worry for you, then you’ve come to the right place! The Lowdown GPs, are warm and welcoming women’s health experts who will listen without judgement so you can get the answers and support you need. \n",

        "Title": "What is Adenomyosis?",
        "Content": "What is adenomyosis?\nAdenomyosis or ad-uh-no-my-O-sis!\nOh sis, another condition that affects the female productive system? We’ve got endometriosis, polycystic ovarian syndrome, fibroids, ovarian cysts….. now what?\nAdenomyosis is a condition that affects the uterus (also known as womb). Let’s recap the anatomy of the uterus before we get medical. \nThe uterus has 3 layers:\n\nThe innermost layer: Endometrial lining\nMiddle muscle layer: Myometrium \nOutermost protective layer: Perimetrium\n\nSo now we know the uterus a little better, adenomyosis is defined as a condition where the endometrial tissue burrows its way into the muscular layers of the uterus.1\nOur endometrial lining is a special type of tissue. It can respond to our changing hormones. It grows preparing for pregnancy and sheds when a fertilised egg is not implanted, leading to your period. And the endometrial tissue in the muscular layer responds no differently. It will grow and shed, without enough space for the blood to escape.\nWhat causes adenomyosis\nSadly, the medical jury is still out. I can hear you asking, why is there so much still not known about women’s health. I agree more research needs to be done, and we’re advocating for that! \nThe government announced that it is investing £25 million2 into expanding women’s health hub services and research, so it is a step in the right direction. We are worth it!\nThere are some theories on the factors that might increase your risk3:\n\nAge: women and those assigned female at birth have usually developed adenomyosis later in their childbearing years, often between the ages 35-50\nChildbirth: Delivering more than one baby has been linked to adenomyosis as it has been suggested that endometrial tissue is more likely to invade the muscular layer during implantation of the pregnancy. But it’s just a theory.\nSurgical procedures: Studies that are looking into adenomyosis have found trauma to the uterus in the form of surgeries like caesarean deliveries and dilatation and curettage (a treatment for abortion and miscarriage and other gynaecological conditions). These surgical procedures could increase the chances of adenomyosis and is a known risk factor of developing the condition due to more research about this link.\n\nAdenomyosis symptoms\nAdenomyosis is not as common as other gynaecological conditions.\n33% of people assigned females at birth (AFAB) do not experience any symptoms from adenomyosis and might only get diagnosed by chance.4\nBut if you fall in the remaining 67%, you might experience the effects of adenomyosis such as:\n\nHeavy periods (menorrhagia)\nPainful periods (dysmenorrhea)\nPain in the back/pelvic area\nPain during or after sex (dyspareunia)\nA bulky (enlarged) uterus\nBloating (sometimes referred to as adenomyosis belly)\n\nThese symptoms might sound similar to you. Yes, the symptoms are general and can overlap with other conditions like endometriosis but more on that later.\nHow do I get an adenomyosis diagnosis?\nAs this diagnosis is still not fully understood, there is no gold standard investigation for adenomyosis. There might be a few different tests your doctor or specialist might suggest. Your doctor might initially suspect adenomyosis based on the symptoms you complain about and any risk factors that might increase your chances of the disease.\nThis might then trigger your doctor to do a5:\n\nPelvic exam: your doctor will have a look at your external genitalia and then feel inside your vagina to assess your cervix and uterus to identify if it is large and bulky. As this is an intimate examination, you can ask for a female doctor and a chaperone to feel more at ease\nUltrasound: Ultrasound scans are not very accurate at identifying endometrial tissue but they can produce an image of the overall uterus and help us identify how thick the muscular layer of the uterus is. It can also rule out other conditions which could be causing your symptoms, like fibroids\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan: This scan better shows any enlargement or thickening of the uterus compared to an ultrasound\nHysteroscopy: Viewing the uterus with a small camera through the cervix directly into the vagina. A biopsy of the uterine endometrial tissue (collecting and testing some cells from the womb lining) might also be taken simultaneously to rule out other conditions like overgrowth of the womb lining or rarely, uterine cancer\n\nUnfortunately, the only way to get a true diagnosis of adenomyosis is by looking at the uterus under a microscope after a hysterectomy (removal of the uterus), but this might not be a viable option for those of you who want children. An ultrasound and MRI can still aid in the diagnosis of the condition. \nAdenomyosis vs endometriosis\nBoth adenomyosis and endometriosis involve endometrial-like tissue. And yes they both present similarly, with painful heavy periods. But adenomyosis tends to cause heavier bleeding. The main difference is where the tissue grows. Endometrial-like tissue grows into the muscle of the uterus in adenomyosis while in endometriosis, the endometrial-like tissue grows outside the uterus6.\nA study found a high association between endometriosis and adenomyosis, finding a link in 54-90% of cases7.\n\n\n\nFeel like you can relate, so why not share your experience too.\nAdenomyosis treatment\nSadly there is no way to permanently remove the endometrial tissue in the muscle layer of the uterus other than a hysterectomy (removal of the womb). But there are treatments to alleviate the symptoms that come with the condition.\nPain medications\nIbuprofen or stronger non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications like naproxen can be given to you to soothe the cramping and pelvic/back pain.\nHormonal medication\nGenerally, the use of contraceptives is recommended in adenomyosis to tackle the pain and heavy bleeding. Birth control pills, the progestogen injection, or the hormonal coil (IUD) can be used. With the hormonal IUD, there are multiple types with varying strengths but to see benefit, we would recommend going for the highest dose of progestogen, as these are licensed to treat heavy bleeding. These are the Mirena, Levosert, or Benilexa, or also the Liletta in the US.\nNon-hormonal medication\nIf contraception is not an option for you right now, or you aren’t comfortable with having more hormones due to side effects, you can ask for something else like tranexamic acid. This type of medication aims to reduce menstrual bleeding.\nHysterectomy\nThis option is not generally recommended if you are of childbearing age. A hysterectomy completely removes your uterus from the body. While it is a definitive way to resolve your symptoms, it is also a definitive way of not being able to have children. It is usually reserved as the final option or for women and AFABs having completed their family or reached menopause. \nAdenomyomectomy\nA conservative option for women and AFABs looking to preserve their uterus. Adenomyomectomy is another surgical procedure but instead of removing the uterus, it aims to remove the abnormal tissue in the uterus wall. A study has shown that this novel technique can reduce 65% of heavy bleeding and 41% of painful periods8.\nThis treatment option is fairly new and may not be readily offered by all healthcare centres. It also may depend on where in the uterus you have adenomyosis. However, it’s a promising surgical technique for those who wish to have children in the future but need to control their symptoms.9\nEndometrial Ablation\nTo reduce heavy bleeding, endometrial ablation removes the endometrial lining of the uterus permanently using heat, cold, or radiofrequency. As the lining is no longer there, your periods should lighten and become more manageable. But as there is no more lining, pregnancy is not possible in the future so is not recommended for women of childbearing age. This option only alleviates the heavy bleeding, not the pain associated with adenomyosis.\nUterine artery embolism\nUterine artery embolism is a procedure that block the arteries which supply the uterus. By blocking the blood supply to the endometrial lining of the uterus, your periods will become lighter as a result. This treatment might also help reduce the discomfort of adenomyosis, with 83% of people having relief from their symptoms. It is not guaranteed that you can get pregnant after this procedure, but one review found pregnancy rates of almost 40% following uterine artery embolisation10.\nComplications of adenomyosis\nHeavy menstrual bleeding is the main symptom commonly associated with the condition. With the high amount of blood loss, sometimes you can develop iron deficiency anaemia as a complication. This is where you have fewer red blood cells than normal due to losing so many during a heavy period, and not having enough iron needed to quickly replace the blood cells. While not life-threatening, it can have a significant impact on your life such as tiredness, shortness of breath, increased heart rate, dizziness, and paleness.\nChronic pain if not treated is another complication. If not addressed, this continual pain can affect your quality of life and physical and mental health. That is no way to live!\nAdenomyosis after menopause \nYou’ll be relieved to hear that adenomyosis gets better after menopause and in most cases completely resolves. As our hormones are declining and no longer taking us on a monthly roller coaster ride, the endometrial-like tissue does not respond to oestrogen like it normally would. So no more heavy, painful periods. \nA rare case of adenomyosis was reported in a 68-year-old Indian woman who was struggling with heavy post-menopausal bleeding despite having reached menopause at the age of 52.11\nAdenomyosis and fertility\nThe extent to which adenomyosis affects fertility rates still needs to be established with further research. One theory on how the condition affects fertility is due to the lack of adequate functioning of the uterus affecting the implantation of the egg on the uterus wall.12 It seems that adenomyosis can affect women getting pregnant, and may affect the success of fertility treatments such as IVF.13 A study in 2014 found that IVF success rates in women with adenomyosis are 28% less than in those without the condition while the rates of miscarriage and stillbirth are higher. However, there’s still lots of gaps in knowledge in this area, and every researcher states in their studies that more work is needed to understand fully how adenomyosis impacts fertility and how it can be improved.\nAdenomyosis and pregnancy\nWomen with adenomyosis can and do get pregnant and have children. However, adenomyosis has been associated with negative pregnancy outcomes. Studies have found higher rates of miscarriage and preterm birth14, along with pre-eclampsia, malposition of the placenta, and small-sized infants15. However, this does not mean that adenomyosis sufferers cannot have successful live pregnancies. \nDuring a pregnancy, you don’t have periods so the main symptoms of adenomyosis (heavy painful periods) will tend to improve. There isn’t much research about what other symptoms you may get from adenomyosis during pregnancy. We know that the appearance of adenomyosis on scans changes due to the pregnancy hormones, but don’t have any further information on how that could impact your symptoms.16\nMore questions?\nAdenomyosis is a complex gynaecological condition that we need more research into. We covered multiple aspects of the condition today in detail. It might be a lot to take in but you don’t have to make any decisions for yourself. Now you know the condition a little better, speak to one of our GPs, who specialise in women’s health. We can answer any questions you might still have and advise you on what might be causing your symptoms.\n",

        "Title": "Signs you’re losing too much blood during your period",
        "Content": "What is menorrhagia?\nHave you ever wondered how much blood you lose on your period? Who has ever weighed their pads or tampons? Definitely not me!\nIt is generally regarded that you lose 25-80ml1 of blood and anything over 80ml is considered heavy menstrual bleeding. But again, how would we know this?\nThis is why the old definition has evolved to a new definition without actually measuring the amount of blood lost. According to the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE)1, heavy menstrual bleeding or menorrhagia is now defined as: “excessive menstrual blood loss which interferes with a woman’s physical, social, emotional, and/or material quality of life”\nAm I losing too much blood?\nShould you worry about your heavy bleeding? Absolutely you should. If you think your periods are hindering you from being your bold energetic self, then definitely get it looked at. \nSo now we know heavy blood loss is based on the impact it has on your life. Let’s look at the symptoms this translates to.\nLifestyle signs of menorrhagia2:\n\nChanging your period product (pad or tampon) 1-2 hourly \nChanging your menstrual cup more frequently than recommended\nHaving to use 2 types of period products together to prevent leaking \nBlood clots larger than 2.5cm (about the size of a 10p coin)\nBleeding through your period product into your clothes\nHaving to avoid participating in daily activities or taking time off work \n\nHeavy bleeding is highly subjective. What might feel heavy for someone might not feel the same for you.\nWith significant blood loss, it can also lead to iron deficiency anaemia.\nHow do heavy periods lead to anaemia?\nAnaemia is where your body does not have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen to your organs and muscles. When you have heavy periods and lose more blood than usual in your period, your body can’t keep up with replacing the blood cells you are losing. Your body needs iron to replace these blood cells, and when you’ve used up your iron stores manically trying to replace the blood, you then hit a wall and can’t make any more. This leads to iron deficiency anaemia. You might feel3:\n\nTired\nShort of breath\nHeart beating too fast (palpitations) \nLooking pale\nHeadaches \n\nWhat might be causing my heavy periods?\nSometimes it might just be normal to have heavy periods without an underlying condition. Sometimes over the course of your roughly 450 periods throughout life, some might just be heavier than others. \nThere are a wide range gynaecological conditions that might be the reason you are bleeding heavily2:\n\nPolycystic ovaries\nFibroids \nEndometriosis \nAdenomyosis \nPelvic inflammatory disease\n\n\n\n\nOther reasons that can increase your bleeding include:\n\nAnticoagulant medications \nChemotherapy medications\nThyroid problems\nClotting disorders such as Von Willebrand disease\nStress\nDepression\n\nHow do I get a diagnosis?\nGetting a diagnosis is an important first step in getting the support you need to manage your periods. \nIf you are worried that you might be struggling with menorrhagia, start by recording your physical and lifestyle symptoms. The more you know about your body, the better you will be able to advocate for yourself when speaking to a healthcare professional.\nA great place to start is by speaking to one of our in-house GPs. We can offer you a safe environment to express your worries!\nTreatments  \nThe aim of treatments, of course, is to alleviate your symptoms and make life easier. Your periods should not take over your life! If you need help, we encourage you to get help! \nGeneral treatments include1:\n\nContraception (the intrauterine system (IUS) or the combined oral contraceptive pill (yes contraception can do so much more than preventing pregnancy)\nMedications that reduce bleeding like tranexamic acid\nAnti-inflammatory medications (bear in mind these are prescription-only medications) like mefenamic acid or naproxen\n\nIf you are also low in iron, your GP can give you some iron tablets to boost these level1. \nBut if these fail, you might need a referral to a specialist to get to the root of the problem and treat it with some more intensive treatments. \nSo what now?\nNow you advocate for yourself. As NICE said, periods are considered heavy if they have a significant effect on your physical, social, emotional, and material quality of life. \nIf you feel this resonates with you, track your symptoms and period product use. Then reach out to your GP but if you’re not keen on the long waiting times, speak to one of our women’s health GPs today!\n",

        "Title": "Can you go swimming on your period?",
        "Content": "\nPicture this: Summer is here! So that means, sun, sea and sand! And let’s be honest if you live in the UK, we have to make the most of our one week of sunshine. So the last thing we are going to do is let our period stop us from swimming. \nCan you go swimming on your period?\nYour time of the month is not a reason to cancel your water fun. It is a common myth that menstruators cannot swim on their period. We are here to reassure you that you will not leave a red trail in the pool or that a shark will sniff you out in the ocean (a very valid worry). \nThe science behind swimming and your period. It is all because of physics and forces. To avoid boring you, let’s keep this physics lesson short and sweet. You’ve heard of gravity, the downward force that pulls us towards the earth, keeping us anchored and not floating away. This force also has a part to play in helping our uterine lining flow out of our vagina. \nWhen you get into a body of water, the upward pressure from the water acts against you. This is called upthrust1 and pushes against our vagina. As upthrust is a large force, it can reduce the rate of your menstrual flow. Swimming does not halt your period flow altogether, it just slows it down because of the resistance from the water2. So yes, in reality, some small amount of blood might leak if you have a particularly heavy flow or you cough/sneeze with enough pressure to overcome the upthrust. That being said, it will unlikely be noticeable in the water. \nLet’s explore some period options to reduce the likelihood of leaking mid-swim.  \nMenstrual products for swimming on your period\nTampons\nA very handy swimming option when on your period. Insert your tampon as you normally would on your period. Be sure to insert it before diving into water as the tampon would just fully absorb water if opened in water. When you are done having fun swimming, remember to change your tampon for hygiene purposes. The tampon might have absorbed some pool or ocean water. \nIf this isn’t an option for you, here are some alternative options on how to swim on your period without a tampon. \nMenstrual cup\nMenstrual cups took the period products market by storm a few years ago but little did you know the first useable cup was patented in 1937 by Leona Chalmers3. The design was not too far off the ones you see nowadays but the main difference is what they are made of. Old menstrual cups were primarily made of latex rubber but now they are mainly made of medical-grade silicone. \nThe cup creates a gentle seal around your cervix and collects period blood over the course of the day. It can be used for up to 12 hours before cleaning and reinsertion. Unlike tampons, the cup won’t absorb pool or ocean water as silicone is not an absorbent material. So there’s no need to rush to the bathroom to change it4. Another bonus of a cup is that the seal decreases your chances of leaking in the pool. Just remember to insert the cup before your dip! \nPeriod swimming costume\nPeriod-friendly swimwear is a game changer when it comes to swimming comfortably on your period. Swimwear brands, like WUKA swimwear*, are specifically designed with additional layers, with one aquaphobic layer to repel water from entering and preventing leaks. It’s been tried and tested by our own Dr Fran who was happy with the protection. Be sure to check the instructions of use for each brand as their recommendations might differ5. \n*FYI – this is an affiliate link, which means The Lowdown will earn a commission on any purchases made\nTips \nTip 1: Stay away from pads \nPads are a comfortable option when it comes to period products, but for swimming we would not recommend it. As pads are made of highly absorbent materials, any moisture that touches a pad will be absorbed including period blood or water6 – meaning it could become massive in the pool! Another issue is the sticky strip of the pad. It will lose its adhesiveness and risks coming loose and slipping out. Unfortunately, we have yet to see a period pad for swimming. This is why period swimwears are a great option if you don’t feel comfortable inserting something into your vagina. \nTip 2: Natural painkiller\nSwimming is a great form of natural pain relief for those irritating period cramps. Any form of aerobic exercise releases endorphins which act to reduce pain and improve our mood. In 20187, a study looked into the benefits of swimming on PMS (premenstrual syndrome) and found that swimming not only alleviated period cramps but also improved mood changes, tiredness and breast tenderness. If you were not already sold on swimming on your period, here’s another reason to convince you to take that plunge! \nDive in\nLife’s too short to miss out on making memories at any point, especially because of our monthly visitor. We don’t believe in period shame here! Period products are getting more diverse and there are so many options available, from tampons to period swimwear, there is something for everyone. It might take a while to feel comfortable in the water, so go at your own pace. Try different products, and when you’re ready dive in! \nIf this blog gave you the answers you were looking for, subscribe to our newsletter for more timely advice and solutions to your everyday questions! \n",

        "Title": "Condom 101: How to use condoms correctly",
        "Content": "The humble male condom…they’ve been around since 1564 as a way to protect against STIs, and there’s even an entire Wikipedia page dedicated to their history. They’re usually the first method of contraception you’re taught about at school – and a big cause of embarrassment while placing one on a plastic phallus in front of Mrs Brown. But when was the last time you had a refresher on how they work and what to do? Well, here it is!\nHow effective are condoms?\nCondoms are a popular method of contraception used by 21% of people who use any form of birth control.1 Studies have shown that they are 98% effective at preventing pregnancy, as long as you use them correctly every time you have sex2. \nCondoms are the most effective method of preventing sexually transmitted infections if you are having sexual contact. They guard against HIV, hepatitis, chlamydia, gonorrhoea and other diseases which are spread through body fluids. \nCondoms can’t provide protection against sexually transmitted infections which are spread through skin-to-skin contact, such as syphilis, genital warts and genital herpes. To protect against these, you should make sure that yourself and your partner have had a full sexual health check-up before you have oral, vaginal or anal sex. \nHow do I use condoms?\nYou can buy condoms online and in most supermarkets and pharmacies, as well as getting them for free from sexual health clinics.\n\nYou don’t need a prescription to get condoms, and there is no minimum age that you need to be to buy them or get them from a sexual health clinic. \nIf you are less than 16, then healthcare providers will not need to tell anyone that you have asked for the condoms, unless they think you are at risk of coming to harm. \n\nThe practical part\nFirst, always make sure that the condom is in-date. There will be an expiry date on the side of the packet. \nYou should also make sure that the condom has a ‘kite-mark’ (sometimes called a UKCE or European CE mark) on the packet – this means that the condom has been manufactured to a high standard.\nOpen the condom carefully, making sure not to rip it. Never use your teeth! (no matter how sexy you may think this looks)\nHold the condom by the tip, squeezing out any air, and then carefully roll down the length of the fully erect penis, to the base. The condom should then stay in place until you have finished having sex.\nThe condom needs to be in place before the penis touches the vaginal area so that it can be effective in preventing pregnancy.\nWhen you’ve finished having sex, you or your partner can roll the condom down carefully, making sure not to spill any semen. It can be disposed of in a bin.\nCondom Do’s and Don’ts\nDO…\n…make sure you use plenty of lubricant which is water or silicone based. Oil based lubricants can cause the condom to split or break.\n…make sure you have checked the safety mark and the expiry date on the packet before using the condom.\nDON’T…\n…use the condom if it doesn’t roll down the penis easily when you put it on. This means it’s inside-out and you will need to use another one.\n…use a latex condom if you have an allergy. Latex free condoms are widely available.\n…flush a used condom down the toilet as they can cause blockages. Simply remove carefully, rolling down from the top, pop it in some tissue and dispose in the rubbish bin. \n…use 2 condoms at once, this doesn’t give you double the protection, and actually can cause one to rip the other, which isn’t ideal\nWhat do I do if the condom breaks?\nAccidents happen, and condoms can break! If this happens, don’t panic. Condoms can break if they are not put on correctly or there is excess friction. \nIf you notice that the condom has broken during sex, then stop and replace with a new one.\nTo prevent pregnancy if the condom has broken, you can use emergency contraception (the morning-after pill) or use a copper IUD within five days of the condom breaking. A GP, pharmacy or sexual health clinic can help with this.\nIf the condom has broken during sex then you are still at risk of getting a sexually-transmitted infection. You should make sure you see your GP or sexual health clinic for a check-up if the condom has broken.\nCan Condoms cause thrush?\nSex can trigger yeast infections and bacterial vaginosis, whether you use a condom or not. This is because the friction during sex can disrupt the natural organisms in your vaginal area. However, condoms themselves don’t cause thrush infections, and some studies have even shown that they can be protective against thrush.3\nWhat do other women think?\nWe asked other Lowdown users what they thought of using condoms. Here’s a summary of what they thought. \nGenerally, women had a positive experiences of using male condoms, finding them easy to use and comfortable during sex. Lots of women like the fact that they do not cause any hormonal side effects, unlike some other forms of birth control. They are highly rated at 4.1 out of 5 stars on our site (as of July 2024). \nSome women felt that condoms caused friction during sex, but this was improved if they used an effective lube. Some women commented that condoms can disrupt spontaneity during sex. In some cases, it can take a bit of trial and error to find the right size and brand of condom that are comfortable for you and your partner. When your male partner has found the right fit, we’re confident that sex will feel good for both of you.\n\n\n\nOur personal favourite brand of condom has to be MyBliss, as they are actually designed and marketed towards women! And don’t forget, if a man is refusing to use a condom, then they don’t respect you, so don’t have sex with them as this reviewer reminds us!\n",

        "Content": "The world of birth control can be tricky. The brands, the uses, and the side effects can all blur into one. Let’s focus on IUD brands today and get to know them a little better. \nA quick history lesson before we get started. The first IUD was invented by a German doctor in 19091 which was made of silkworm gut! WoW!\nWhat is an IUD\nAn intrauterine device or IUD2 for short is a small T-shaped device that sits in your uterus, acting as a birth control type called long-acting reversible contraception (LARC). According to the Centre for Disease Control, 10.4% of women in the USA aged 15-49 use LARCs3.\nThere are 2 options: hormone-releasing device or copper device. \nHormonal intrauterine devices:\n\nKyleena \nLiletta \nMirena \nSkyla is a brand that has been discontinued in the US\n\nCopper intrauterine device:\n\nParagard\n\nHow does an IUD work\n\n\n\nThe Kyleena, Liletta and Mirena IUDs release the hormone progestin, a synthetic version of progesterone. Progesterone is a naturally occurring hormone in our body. This prevents pregnancy in 2 ways:\n\nThickening the cervical mucus, creating a tricky barrier for the sperm to enter the uterus\nThinning out the lining of the womb so a fertilised egg can’t implant and grow into a pregnancy\n\nIn some people, hormonal IUDs also prevent ovulation (ovary releasing an egg) so no egg = no baby.\nThe Paragard IUD contains copper. Copper creates a toxic environment for sperm affecting the way they swim in4. So it makes it harder for the sperm to reach the egg, reducing chances of fertilization.\n\n\n\n\n \nKyleena \nLiletta\nMirena\nSkyla\nParagard\n\n\nType\nProgestin-releasing\nProgestin-releasing\nProgestin-releasing\nProgestin-releasing\nCopper\n\n\nHormone dose in total\n19.5mg \n52mg\n52mg\n13.5mg\nN/A\n\n\nDuration\n5 years\n8 years\n8 years\n3 years\n12 years\n\n\nEffectiveness5\n99%\n99%\n99%\n99%\n99%\n\n\n\n\nCrazy to think how such a small device can prevent 99 out of 100 pregnancies. \nIUD brand side effects\nKyleena \nFrequent side effects of Kyleena6 are:\n\nHeadaches/Migraines\nTummy pain (abdominal and pelvic)\nGreasy skin \nChanges to your period flow\nSpotting \nIrregular periods\nAbsent periods (Amenorrhoea)\nOvarian Cysts\nLow mood/Depression\nInflammation to the external genitalia (vulvovaginitis)\nNausea\nUpper genital tract infection \nBreast pain/tenderness\nExpulsion of the IUD \nVaginal discharge\nPain and spotting on insertion\n\n\n\n\nLiletta \nFrequent side effects of Liletta7 are:\n\nHeadaches/Migraines\nTummy pain (abdominal and pelvic)\nAcne \nPainful periods (dysmenorrhoea)\nSpotting \nIrregular periods\nAbsent periods (Amenorrhoea)\nLow mood/Depression \nAnxiety\nPainful sexual intercourse (dyspareunia)\nBreast pain/tenderness\nVaginal discharge\nVaginal infections\nPain and spotting on insertion\n\nMirena \nFrequent side effects of Mirena8 are:\n\nHeadaches/Migraines\nTummy pain (abdominal and pelvic)\nAcne\nChanges to your period flow\nSpotting \nIrregular periods\nAbsent periods (Amenorrhoea)\nOvarian Cysts\nLow mood/Depression\nInflammation to the external genitalia (vulvovaginitis)\nNausea\nUpper genital tract infection \nBreast pain/tenderness\nExpulsion of the IUD \nVaginal discharge\nBack pain \nExcessive hair growth on the body (Hirsutism)\nPainful periods (dysmenorrhoea)\nPain and spotting on insertion\n\n\n\n\nSkyla \nFrequent side effects of Skyla9 are:\n\nHeadache/Migraine\nTummy pain (abdominal and pelvic)\nAcne\nIrregular periods\nAbsent periods (Amenorrhoea)\nOvarian Cysts\nLow mood/Depression\nInflammation to the external genitalia (vulvovaginitis)\nNausea\nBreast pain/tenderness\nExpulsion of the IUD \nVaginal discharge\nVaginal infection\nBack pain \nPuffiness in your hands, feet, and face\nWeight gain\nPain and spotting on insertion\n\nParagard\nFrequent side effects of Paragard10 are:\n\nExpulsion of the IUD \nPainful sexual intercourse (dyspareunia)\nSpotting \nHeavier periods\nLonger period lengths\nLow iron count (anemia) due to longer and heavier periods\nPainful periods (dysmenorrhoea)\nVaginal discharge\nBack pain \nTummy pain (abdominal and pelvic)\n\nBenefits of IUDs:\n\nDon’t rely on your remembering them\nDon’t affect your fertility\nAre super effective\nCan be used as emergency birth control (more effective than Plan B!)\nMake periods more manageable\n\nAs they are inserted into the uterus, there is no need to remember to take something daily. It is hassle-free and works 24/7 to prevent pregnancies. Yes, the IUDs last for a long time, especially the Paragard but they are not permanent, phew. So you can get them inserted and forget about it. When you’re ready to start family planning, simply get it removed and your reproductive system will be ready to go! IUDs do not affect your long term fertility at all. The hormonal IUDs can lighten or stop periods. So, on top of being a LARC they can also make your periods more manageable. \n\n\n\nIUDs including the Paragard, Mirena, and Liletta are also licensed be used as emergency birth control in the US. If you’ve had sex without protection and want to prevent a potential pregnancy, you can choose these IUDs as long as it is within 120 hours or 5 days of unprotected sex. Once it’s inserted, it is 99% effective at stopping pregnancy and you can then keep using it as birth control long term.\nSo how do I choose?\nThere are many options in the sea of birth control. Trying to narrow down what is right for you might seem like a mission. First, start by doing some preliminary research and deciding on the benefits you want from your choice. If you have some options you’re trying to narrow down, our birth control comparison tool will make things easier for you. If you have no idea where to start, use our birth control recommender quiz to find your perfect match.\nYour personal experience of birth control could make a huge difference in someone’s birth control choice, so why not share? \n",

        "Title": "What is PMS?",
        "Content": "\nWhat is PMS?\nYou’ve either heard the word PMSing or used the word PMSing yourself. Who hasn’t! But do you know what PMS actually means other than a loosely veiled insult from your family or partner? PMS stands for pre-menstrual syndrome. It pretty much describes itself. Pre meaning before the menstrual phase of our cycle, so it refers to symptoms you experience before your period1. Around 90% of us have hormonal changes such as breast tenderness, food cravings and bloating before our period, these are called premenstrual symptoms. However, these can vary in severity with only 20-40% of us having symptoms that classify as a diagnosis of PMS, and roughly 5-8% who have a more severe condition called premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD)2,3,4.\nWhat are the symptoms of PMS?\nPMS symptoms are an amalgamation of emotional, behavioural and physical symptoms. These symptoms can present in a whole host of different ways. Some people live a completely normal life with PMS while others find it debilitating. \nSymptoms look like:\n\nMood swings\nTearfulness\nFeeling low or anxious\nIrritability and anger\nDifficulty concentrating\nBloating \nHeadaches\nMuscle tenderness\nTender breast\nSkin changes (spots or dryness)\nCravings resulting in eating more\nLethargy/lack of energy\nDifficulty sleeping/insomnia\nLoss of sexual desire\n\nWhen does PMS begin and how long does PMS last?\nPMS symptoms can begin from your very first period, and continue until the menopause when your periods stop. You might get a break if you have any pregnancies or stop your cycle with hormonal contraception, and the symptoms can wax and wane throughout your reproductive life. Some women find that PMS worsens throughout the perimenopause.\nWithin each cycle, PMS starts about one to two weeks before your period starts. It is linked to the luteal phase of our cycle5 (recap on the menstrual cycle). Our hormones are not the only ones going on a rollercoaster ride throughout our cycle, so do we. It is theorised that PMS manifests itself due to our tissues and brains sensitivity to our rise and fall of these hormones6.\nWe have on average around 480 periods throughout our reproductive life4. Women studied in the US have roughly 6.4 days of symptoms each month, and if we multiply this, it’s around 8 years of your life potentially living with these symptoms7. The good news is, PMS symptoms should improve as your period starts and fully disappear a few days in, and there are treatments….!\nHow can I get a PMS diagnosis?\nIt might not be the answer you want to hear, but there is no test for PMS. Your doctor might do a blood test to rule out other conditions that can have similar symptoms such as underactive or overactive thyroid, but these can’t confirm PMS.\nYour GP will ask you to record your symptoms over at least 2 menstrual cycles to establish a pattern of your symptoms1. The best way to record these symptoms is to use a questionnaire called “The Daily Record of Severity of Problems”. PMS is diagnosed if you meet the following criteria:\n\nSymptoms are present in the luteal phase of your cycle\nSymptoms affect your day to day living – for example, your ability to work, go to school or your relationships \nSymptoms must get better when your period begins\nYou must have a week without symptoms after the first day of your period\nThis pattern is recurring\n\nInterestingly, it doesn’t actually matter what symptoms you have or how many, for a diagnosis in the UK, it’s all about how they affect you and the timings throughout your cycle. \nIn the US, you should have symptoms for at least 5 days prior to your period which then disappear within the first 4 days of your cycle, and doctors will ask you to track for 3 cycles for a diagnosis.8\nPMS is not a joke, some people really struggle with the impact the symptoms have on their quality of life. If you need help and don’t know who to open up to, reach out to our lovely in-house women health GPs. They are a safe space and shoulder to lean on and really know their stuff with treatment.\nPMS lifestyle therapy\nNow we know the basics of PMS, how do we actually get rid of these pesky symptoms. \nWhile medications can help flip the switch and make this week of our cycle normal, lifestyle changes are also incredibly important. Some general advice is to1:\n\nExercise regularly (yes, the last thing you want to do but those endorphins – our natural feel good hormones – can do you wonders)\nEat a well-balanced diet (this does not mean you have to put down that bar of chocolate)\nGet plenty of sleep (try encompassing some sleep hygiene practises to ensure you get quality and quantity of sleep)\nManage your stress levels (yoga and meditation might calm your nerves)\nPainkillers might work to easy the headaches and muscle pain\nSupplements have research to show that they can help with PMS symptoms, as long as they are taken correctly!\n\nFun fact: Dark chocolate (rich in cocoa) is rich in magnesium and may have similar pain relieving properties of ibuprofen10. Yes, this makes it the perfect excuse (not that you need one) to munch all the chocolate you want when those period cramps kick in! \nPMS treatments \nIf lifestyle changes aren’t working and your PMS symptoms are affecting your life, your healthcare professional might try some treatments like hormonal contraception, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or antidepressants. \nCombined hormonal contraception can relieve PMS symptoms as it regulates the hormone levels in the body. There are sooooo many birth control brands out there, so making a choice can be confusing but this is why we have a contraception comparison tool to make this decision a little easier. If you want to know what using a specific contraception is like, why not see what our community have said. Their experiences might help you narrow down an option!\nCBT is a talking therapy that can help you work through the emotional and behavioural symptoms associated with PMS11. And finally a type of antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been shown to improve PMS symptoms. It can be taken daily for 2 weeks before your period or throughout your whole cycle11. \nPMS vs PMDD\nA small subset of people who have PMS, experience these symptoms but on a more severe scale. This is referred to as PMDD or premenstrual dysmorphic disorder. We cover the exact differences between PMS and PMDD in more detail elsewhere to keep things simple.\nSummary \nWho knows why PMS occurs….and does it add any benefit to our cycle as menstruators?….. absolutely not! Sadly it happens, but it does not mean we have to put up with it. If your symptoms benefit from lifestyle changes, they are not just tips for PMS but also living a healthier life. However, if your symptoms are moderate to severe and interfere with your quality of life, don’t let PMS ruin two weeks of each month. Reach out to your GP for some support, or speak to a friend/family/partner! \n",

        "Title": "Fibroids vs endometriosis: what’s the difference?",
        "Content": "\nWhere is the pain coming from?\nWhile fibroids and endometriosis have similar symptoms that can affect your quality of life, they are actually very distinct conditions. Taking some time to understand the differences between the two conditions will allow you to effectively express your symptoms and concerns to your doctor and work transparently with them to find an effective solution. \nHere at the Lowdown, we believe in empowering our community with the knowledge to understand what is happening in their body. \nThe Uterus\nBefore we dive into fibroids vs endometriosis, let’s take some time to understand the anatomy of the uterus. Not another science lesson! Bear with us, it’ll all come together. \nThe uterus has 3 layers1:\n\nThe endometrium: the lining of the uterus that sheds during our period \nThe myometrium: muscle layer of the uterus\nThe serosa or perimetrium: outer layer made up of epithelial cells which are skin like cells that cover most of our body’s organs\n\nEndometriosis or Fibroids?\nFibroids are an overgrowth of the muscle layer of the uterus. There are 3 primary types of fibroids and they can affect around 70% of us2. We still do not know why they happen (like a lot of conditions), but science has found a link between fibroids and genetics! What we do know is that fibroids love oestrogen so they tend to shrink during menopause when oestrogen levels are on the decline. \nEndometriosis on the other hand is a condition where cells similar to the endometrium lining of the uterus are also found in other parts of the body. It can present anywhere like the ovaries, fallopian tube, bowel and in rare cases have been discovered in the lung3! It affects 10% of women in the UK4.\nSo with 70% of us having fibroids and 10% of us having endometriosis, it’s clear there will be some people who have both.\nWhat’s the difference between fibroid and endometriosis symptoms?\nSo now we know the difference between the two conditions, let’s dive into how these conditions present themselves. Some individuals might not experience any symptoms while living with the condition and can go years without getting a diagnosis, others may be able to tell which symptom is being caused by which condition. \nFibroid symptoms\nThe common symptoms of fibroids are: \n\nHeavy periods (menorrhagia)\nBleeding between periods (intermenstrual bleeding)\nTiredness due to iron deficiency anaemia\nIncreased need to pee \nPain in the back or pelvic region \nConstipation and bloating \nDiscomfort during sex\nDifficulty getting pregnant\n\n \nEndometriosis symptoms\nThe common symptoms of endometriosis are: \n\nHeavy periods (menorrhagia)\nPainful periods (dysmenorrhea)\nBleeding between periods (intermenstrual bleeding)\nPainful during urination or bowel movements \nPain in the back or pelvic region \nBloating \nPainful sexual intercourse \nFatigue \nDifficulty getting pregnancy\n\nAs you can see there is a large overlap in symptoms and it can be confusing to know what is the underlying reason without getting medical advice. If you want some answers to your symptoms and are tired of waiting for an appointment, we have a team of women’s health GPs who are here to listen and support you in understanding your body. That is why the Lowdown was created!\nFibroids or endometriosis\nIf the symptoms are so similar, how will you know what’s actually wrong? Fibroids can be diagnosed on a pelvic exam and can be easily confirmed with an ultrasound scan5. However, endometriosis is a little tricker. The best investigation is a laparoscopy (a small camera inserted into your abdomen to look for endometrial tissue outside the uterus)6. Sadly, ultrasound and MRI scans are often not sensitive enough to pick up every detail of these foreign endometrial tissues. These scans can give a diagnosis for some women, but if they’re normal, it doesn’t mean you definitely do not have endometriosis. However, you can start treatment for suspected endometriosis based on your symptoms alone if you are not keen on surgery. \nTreatment \nThe treatment for both endometriosis and fibroids is not straightforward, there are a lot of considerations to take into account. Generally for heavy periods, oral medication can be offered to reduce your blood flow. Varying strengths of painkillers can tackle painful periods and hormonal contraception can be used to both reduce or stop period flow and minimise painful periods. We have dedicated blogs just navigating the world of both fibroid and endometriosis treatment options! \nEndometriosis with fibroids \nThere is no reason why the conditions cannot occur in tandem as they originate from different parts of the body and pelvis and we think have different causes (but we still don’t know exactly what causes either). Some research has shown that endometriosis does present with fibroids and vice versa7 as both these conditions have links to oestrogen. \nSummary \nIt is clear that the cause of endometriosis and fibroids are distinct but the way they present themselves with symptoms have an overlap. \nWe have a community of people with endometriosis who have had their battles and now want to spread awareness of the condition. They have opened up about their personal experiences so you can learn from the struggles that resonate with you! And if you feel your experience will benefit someone else in their endometriosis journey, speak up as you never know how it might support others!\n",

        "Title": "Fibroids after menopause",
        "Content": "\nWhat are fibroids?\nFibroids are a common gynaecological condition, experienced by 70% of women at some point in their life1. They are an oestrogen-dependant benign tumour that grows from the muscular layer of the uterus wall. That is fibroids in a nutshell! But there is so much more to them and we cover everything about fibroids here!\nHormones and menopause \nDuring our lifetime, we experience a natural transition where your hormones decline and your periods get more infrequent until they completely halt. This occurs as our egg supply slowly diminishes and ovulation (release of an egg) becomes infrequent. At the same time, the ovaries gradually stop producing oestrogen and progesterone<sup2.\nFibroids after menopause \nDo fibroids shrink after menopause?\nAs fibroids flourish in oestrogen rich environments, the decline in oestrogen during menopause is not favourable for them. So as a result, the size of the fibroids and therefore the symptoms they cause tend to slowly reduce. Your risk of developing a postmenopausal fibroid during this transition period is also lower3. However, this might not always be the case and some people still experience symptoms affecting their quality of life during their menopausal phase. \nDo fibroids delay menopause?\nFibroids have no impact on menopause. Menopause is driven by the ovaries and fibroids are found in the uterus. \nWhat are the symptoms of fibroids after menopause?\nSymptoms of fibroids after menopause should lessen in severity as oestrogen levels have reduced, however, you can still experience:\n\nHeavy bleeding during perimenopause\nPelvic pain and back pain \nIncreased need to urinate\nAbdominal swelling/pressure\n\nAfter reaching the menopause (12 months without a period), any form of bleeding is a cause of concern and can be a sign of overgrowth of the womb lining or womb cancer. If you notice spotting or bleeding a year after no periods, this needs to get checked by a doctor. \n\n“If any woman comes into my clinic and describes bleeding from down below after the menopause, I will always investigate this urgently. This doesn’t matter if the bleeding is fresh, old, or even just a slight amount of pink or brown discharge – it’s the best thing to get it checked.” – Dr Fran Yarlett, The Lowdown Medical Director\n\nTreatment for fibroids after menopause\nDuring premenopausal years, fertility and plans for a family are a key consideration taken into account when deciding on the right fibroid treatment. Oral medication, contraception or minimally invasive procedures are usually recommended as the first options. Hysterectomy (surgical removal of the uterus as a whole) is reserved for severe symptoms, failed treatments or large fibroids. As fertility is no longer a concern during menopause, surgery might be more readily offered. However, treatment will be decided based on the size, location and symptoms severity of the fibroid, plus your medical history and fitness for surgical procedures. This does not mean medication and contraception (especially the hormonal coil) cannot be used during this time as well. \nFibroids and HRT\nFibroids, menopause and HRT is a tricky trio. \nHRT stands for hormonal replacement therapy. During perimenopause and menopause, the decline in oestrogen and progesterone can afflict individuals with frustrating symptoms like hot flushes, mood swings and night sweats to name a few. Replacing these hormones in the body can alleviate the symptoms and restore your quality of life. \nHowever, this is the tricky part. Although HRT can benefit menopausal symptoms, the re-introduction of oestrogen into the body might trigger the growth of fibroids. Occasionally, fibroid symptoms might even worsen as the fibroids grow in size4, similar to this user’s account:\n\nIt is important to disclose any history of fibroids to your doctor if you’re starting HRT as they might have to readjust oestrogen and progesterone doses to account for the fibroids. Often doctors will “start low and go slow” with your oestrogen dose to be able to carefully monitor any fibroid symptoms.\nIf you are worried about the impact of HRT on your fibroids, speak to one of our lovely women’s health GPs or menopause specialists. They have a wealth of experience and can offer you advice specific to your circumstances. \nWhat’s next?\nPerimenopause and menopause is a pivotal transitioning point in a woman’s life and we do not speak up enough about it’s true reality. Fibroids symptoms should ease with menopause, but in some cases can be complicated with HRT.  You do not have to go through this period alone. Our perimenopause community has opened up about their perimenopause experiences so you can learn and feel less alone! \n",

        "Title": "Fibroids and pregnancy",
        "Content": "What are fibroids? \nFibroids, medically known as leiomyomas, are the most common gynaecological benign tumour. They derive from the muscular and connective tissue layer of the uterus1. While fibroids affect 70% of women and assigned females at birth (AFABs)2, it has only been identified as the sole cause of infertility in 2-3% of cases3.\nWhile there’s so much more to say about fibroids, this article is dedicated to fibroids in pregnancy. So if you’re sitting there thinking, I need to know more about fibroids, we got you covered. \nCan fibroids cause infertility?\nIt is rare for fibroids to cause infertility. In fact, fibroids are only mentioned in one of The Lowdown’s fertility stories up until July 2024. The different types of fibroids affect fertility in separate ways. Generally, fibroids can act as a barrier to the sperm and egg getting together or a fertilised egg implantation into the womb lining. Due to the nature in which submucosal fibroids grow, they can also block the fallopian tubes if large or in an unfavourable location. This means the egg will not reach the uterus, having a direct impact on pregnancy rates4.  Submucosal fibroids have the highest impact on conception rates compared to the other types. Subserosal fibroids do not seem to affect conception rates while intramural fibroids have some link to reducing fertility3.  \nThis can be a lot of information to take on board, especially if you are trying to conceive (TTC), but depending on the size of the fibroid, you can go on to have a normal healthy pregnancy with good outcomes for your baby. If you are TTC with a fibroid diagnosis, share your worries with your GP or gynaecologist. They might be able to offer you advice or treatment that will improve these chances, and don’t forget to optimise your fertility in every way you can, using our fertility tool.\n\n\n\nEager to speak to someone but tired of waiting for a GP appointment, skip the queue and book in straight with our wonderful team of in-house women’s health GPs. \nTreatments for fibroids affecting fertility\nAs subserosal fibroids grow outside the uterus into the pelvic area, it makes sense that they do not affect fertility rates. It is for this reason that treatments to remove or shrink these fibroids will have little to no effect on improving pregnancy rates3. \nPregnancy and live births are lower when submucosal fibroids are in the uterus. As they grow into the uterine cavity, they can distort the space and restrict egg implantation, sperm meeting the egg, and the growth of the baby. Removing these fibroids (myomectomy) has been positively linked to improving pregnancy rates4,5, which is a great thing! Myomectomy is therefore the number one choice for women with large submucosal fibroids who want a family.\nThe treatment for intramural fibroids affecting pregnancy is still unclear. The evidence behind myomectomy improving pregnancy rates is not great. Alternatively, medications can be offered to shrink the fibroids before TTC6. \nA medical treatment called gonadotrophin releasing hormone agonists and hormonal contraceptives (which are often both used to treat the heavy bleeding that comes with fibroids) both affect your fertility and prevent pregnancy. So these wouldn’t be your first choice if you’re hoping to get pregnant.\nThese are just treatment options specific to TTC, there are a whole host of treatment types to tackle the symptoms of fibroids outside of pregnancy. From oral medication to hormonal contraception and surgery, your GP or specialist can talk you through the options which can alleviate your symptoms and improve your quality of life. \nPotential Complications \nMother \nUterine fibroids in pregnancy tend to remain unchanged in size. In some cases, the fibroid might grow during the first trimester when oestrogen levels peak the most. From what we know, fibroids thrive off oestrogen. \nMost mums do not get diagnosed with fibroids until they fall pregnant as they don’t always cause symptoms. Some mums might experience tummy pain due to the fibroids. This might feel similar to bad period-like cramping4. \nIf the fibroid is blocking the direct passage between the uterus and the world, this might complicate vaginal deliveries. If this is an identified problem in pregnancy, your specialist obstetrician will discuss the varying options for delivery that prioritise your and your baby’s health! \nBaby \nThe type and location of fibroid can have an impact on the baby during pregnancy. Submusocal and sometimes intramural fibroids take up space in the uterus. By blocking the area in which the baby needs to grow, there can be an increased rate of miscarriage, early labour, detachment of the placenta from the uterus or growth restriction7.  This sounds terrifying, but that’s why we have regular midwife appointments and scans throughout pregnancy to keep an eye out for any problems and let the experts plan your pregnancy and delivery.\nWhat’s next \nWell, it is important to remember, that trying to convince is not as easy as mainstream media makes it out to be. It can be a short or a long journey and most couples will get that positive pregnancy test within a year8. TTC with or without fibroids can be tough but having that support and knowing you are not alone can ease your burden. Be kind to yourself and if you need support our Lowdown community has opened up and shared their experiences of conception, offering advice along the way. \nIf you have an experience that is near and dear to your heart, that you believe can help others, we would love to hear from you! \nIn most cases, people with fibroids have fairly uneventful pregnancies. Trust us, uneventful is what you are hoping for as you have a lifetime of events coming up!\n",

These growths are medically considered non-cancerous tumours and afflict 70% of assigned females at birth (AFABs) at some point in their lifetime1. Yes, 70%! Fibroids are far more common than you think. \nSome people are at a higher risk of developing fibroids due to genetic risk factors or increased exposure to oestrogen. \nThere is a lot to cover about fibroids, but this article will focus on the different types of fibroids. If you are keen to read more about the causes, symptoms and treatments, head on over to our article on the basics of fibroids. \nTypes of fibroids \nThe 3 main types of fibroids are2:\n\nIntramural fibroids\nSubserosal fibroids\nSubmucosal fibroids\n\nYou can also have pedunculated fibroids and cervical fibroids. \nLet’s dive in! \nIntramural fibroids \nThis is the most common type of fibroid. They develop inside the muscle wall of the uterus.\nSubserosal fibroids \nWhen a fibroid grows on the outside wall of the uterus, it is referred to as a subserosal fibroid. This type can grow very large and also contribute to obstructive symptoms like pelvic or back pain, and needing to urinate more (the fibroid puts pressure on the bladder) as it can protrude into the pelvic area. \nSubmusocal fibroids \nThese fibroids are a little more complicated. They grow in the muscle layer but beneath the inner lining of the uterus, growing into the cavity of the uterus. Infertility is rarely caused by fibroids unless extremely large in size. However, as submucosal fibroids grow into the uterus, they are more likely to affect fertility as they might block fallopian tubes, preventing the egg from reaching the uterus3.  \nPedunculated fibroids\nPedunculated fibroids are not a type of fibroid, but a subset. Only the subserosal and submucosal fibroids can become pedunculated. But what is pedunculated? If the fibroid is hanging by a small stalk of tissue, it is referred to as a pedunculated fibroid. \nCervical fibroids\nAs the name suggests, this fibroid grows from the cervix. This is a rarer type, making up 0.6% of all fibroids4. \nDescribing the types of fibroids without using some medical terminology is tough. But to make things easier, here is an image so you can visualise and better understand the fibroid types. \nTreating fibroids \nThe treatments of fibroids have come far and wide. Depending on the symptoms, size or location of the fibroids, your GP or specialist can offer you medications, hormonal contraception, and surgical or non-surgical procedures. There is a lot to understand about fibroid treatments so we have dedicated an article just to guide you through this topic. \nGenerally, medication or hormonal contraception is tried first.\nIf this fails or the fibroids are larger than 3cm, you will be referred to a gynaecologist (specialist) who will navigate the more intensive treatment options with you. \nNot all fibroids need to be removed, some might not even cause any pesky symptoms. So you might just need to keep an eye on it. Mild symptoms might resolve with oral medication or contraception. \nSurgical options are usually reserved for large fibroids or ones causing moderate to severe symptoms. \nIt is very overwhelming to know which treatment option might be right for you. We have a contraception recommender to make this choice easier, or you can open up to our women’s health GP. We are here to listen and support. \n\n\n\nSummary\nFibroids come in all shapes and sizes. You can also have multiple fibroids. Unless bothering you with uncomfortable symptoms, not all fibroids need to be treated. There is no one-size-fits-all treatment for fibroids. It will be tailored to your needs and symptoms with the main aim of improving your quality of life! \nWe have just covered a small aspect of fibroids.

        "Content": "\nFibroids: The Recap\nFibroids are growths from the muscle and connective tissue of the uterus. They are non-cancerous and rest assured, have a low progression risk of turning into cancer. Fibroids are more common than you might think, with a humongous 70% of us developing the condition at some point in our life 1. Fibroids can be asymptomatic so you might live with them and not even realise you have one. There is also a huge spectrum of fibroid symptoms ranging from mild to severe, depending on their size and location! \nFibroids diagnosis usually comes from an internal pelvic exam and an ultrasound scan. \nIf you are eager to learn more about the causes and symptoms of the condition, head on over to our What are fibroids article to get your answers!\nThere are multiple types of uterine fibroids treatment, so if you are lost, you have come to the right place. We will break down the options so you can better understand what is right for you. The more you know the more autonomy you have over your body!\nFibroid Treatment\nMedical treatment of fibroids\nMedical treatments for fibroids primarily aim to reduce the heavy bleeding associated with the condition. It might not be effective for fibroids that are too large. \nTranexamic acid or mefenamic acid are oral medications that can reduce heavy bleeding associated with fibroids. Though the names sound similar, they have different mechanisms of action. Tranexamic acid clots blood, reducing blood loss while mefenamic acid reduces the level of prostaglandin in our body which is linked to heavy periods2.\nThese are usually the first line of treatment if your symptoms are mild-moderate and your fibroids are less than 3cm in size3. \nAlternatively, if these fail, symptoms are too severe or the fibroids are too big, your GP will refer you to a specialist. They might consider another medical option called gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRHas) or ulipristal acetate. Instead of treating the symptoms directly, this medication works to reduce the size of the fibroid and therefore your symptoms2. Sadly GnRHas medications trigger uncomfortable menopausal-like side effects: hot flushes, sweating, vaginal dryness and stiff muscles2. Most people are given “add back” HRT to manage these symptoms. Ulipristal acetate also has a terrible side effect profile. It can induce severe nausea, severe tiredness, yellowing of the skin and tummy aches3. For these reasons, both these medications are only prescribed for a short period of time. \nHormonal treatment of fibroids\nYou could say contraception is a jack of all trades. It has more uses than just preventing pregnancy. When it comes to fibroids, hormonal contraception prevents the lining of the womb from growing, thus reducing heavy periods2. Contraception types you can use are the hormonal coil (Mirena, Levosert, Benilexa), implant (Nexplanon), injection (Depo-Provera, Noristerat, Sayana Press) or the contraceptive pill (combined and progestogen-only). \nEach contraceptive can help to reduce heavy bleeding, however, they can come with varying side effects. Unfortunately, some common contraception side effects are mood swings, acne and reduced libido. You might find relief from one contraceptive type but this might not be the case for another. We have a directory full of reviews of experiences from the Lowdown community, and you can use our comparison tool to find your best match based on how likely a method is to reduce heavy bleeding alongside its side effects.\n\n\nIf you are unsure where to start, our contraception quiz is a great aid to make your decision easier.\n\n\nSurgical treatment of fibroids\nIf you are sadly experiencing severe symptoms, have fibroids larger than 3cm or medical or hormonal treatment options have failed you4, some surgeries can be offered to help with the symptoms of your fibroids. A fibroid specialist (gynaecologist) will discuss further options with you. GnRHas might be prescribed prior to the surgery to shrink the fibroids. \nDepending on the size and location of the fibroids, removal of the fibroid (myomectomy) might be considered if you want to maintain your fertility. Removing the fibroid itself will mean those uncomfortable symptoms should resolve. However, in 10-25% of cases, fibroids can re-grow5. \nMyomectomy can be done via the abdomen or via hysteroscopy. A hysteroscopic procedure is minimally invasive as instruments are guided via the vagina into the uterus to remove the fibroid. This means no cuts will be made to your abdomen. If the fibroid cannot be removed entirely, a procedure called morcellation can be performed. The fibroid is cut into smaller pieces to allow for easier removal6.\nHowever, if the removal of the fibroid itself is not suitable, your doctor might discuss the complete removal of your uterus (hysterectomy)2. \nRemoving your uterus as a whole is a big life-changing decision, especially if you are of reproductive age. When going through your options, remind yourself it is your body and you can take some time to think through the different treatment types before landing on one that suits you best. If you do not feel your concerns are being heard, you can always ask for a second opinion. Make sure to use your voice to advocate for yourself. \nMy mother was diagnosed with fibroids in her mid-forties, so I asked her about her treatment options: “My doctor re-assured me that this was a common diagnosis and many women suffer from fibroids. I asked around my circle of girlfriends and was surprised to know a handful had a similar diagnosis a few years back. Like them, I was presented with 2 treatment options, one to remove the fibroids itself and the second to undergo a hysterectomy. The first option came with a high probability of the fibroids growing again within 3 to 5 years. Fortunately, I had completed my family at that point. I chose instead to undergo a hysterectomy so that my fibroids would be resolved once and for all.”\nAlternative treatments for fibroids\nMedicine has come a long way in recent decades and now there are alternative options to surgery. If you are not keen on surgery, uterine artery embolism (UAE) and endometrial ablation could be a suitable alternative2. \nUAE is a day procedure under local anaesthetic that cuts off the blood supply to the fibroid. Without enough blood flow, the fibroids shrink and bleed less, reducing the severity of symptoms. On the other hand, endometrial ablation thins the uterine lining, to reduce bleeding. \nThese are both simpler and quicker procedures with a lower complication rate compared to surgery. If medical, hormonal or major surgical treatments are not for you, these alternatives can be used for varying fibroid sizes. However, this decision will be one you make together with your gynaecologist. \nWhat is an endometrial fibroid treatment?\nMedically, endometrial fibroids do not exist. If you have a growth from the endometrial lining in the uterus, it is referred to as a polyp. If you are curious about the difference between a fibroid and polyp and its treatment, we have you covered in our blog.\nSummary \nThere is a lot of information and considerations to take on board about fibroid treatments. Some options might work for you while others might just make things worse. If you still have some unanswered questions, our medical team at the Lowdown are always here to support you, so if you need a helping hand just reach out and chat to one of us!\n",

        "Content": "\nLet’s recap on fibroids\nFibroids are a gynaecological condition affecting 70% of assigned females at birth (AFABs)2 at some point in their lifetime. There is no exact cause of fibroids but there is a link with genetics or increased oestrogen exposure. African Americans are also more likely to develop fibroids3. \nBut what exactly are fibroids? They are the most common benign gynaecological tumour3. They are overgrowths of the muscular and connective tissue layer in the uterus. Intramural, subserosal and submucosal fibroids are the 3 main types of fibroids, and in some rare cases, cervical fibroids can arise. \nThat’s a short and sweet summary of fibroids. But there is so much more to them, and we have an article covering the various aspects of fibroids in more detail.  \nToday we will focus on the symptoms fibroids can trouble you with. \nSymptoms of uterine fibroids\nThe type and size of a fibroid do not determine the fibroid symptoms you might experience. Sometimes, you might live a trouble-free life with fibroids. In other cases, the symptoms can have a mild, moderate or severe effect on your quality of life. \nGenerally, fibroids can present with4:\n\nHeavy bleeding during your period (menorrhagia)\nBleeding between your period (intermenstrual bleeding) \nAnaemia (a low level of red blood cells due to heavy blood loss and low levels of iron)\n\nAnaemia is more than just low iron, it can cause symptoms like dizziness, palpitations, shortness of breath and even chest pain, not to mention looking like you’re an extra in Twilight (aka pale)5.\nWhen your fibroids become too large or grow into the pelvic area, they can cause a new set of symptoms known as obstructive symptoms4:\n\nAbdominal or pelvic pain (due to the fibroid putting pressure on surrounding organs)\nNeeding to pee more (as the fibroid can press on the bladder)\nTummy swelling (with a large fibroid, it can make your tummy look larger)\n\nI asked my mother what it was like to live with fibroids: “My monthly periods became increasingly heavier that I had to change my heavily soaked pad every 2 hours. I assumed wrongly this was a pre-menopausal phase of my mid-forties and so did not bother to consult a doctor. I lived with terribly heavy periods for a while until one day, I had an embarrassing situation at a wedding where I leaked through my clothes. I realised then something was not right. A doctor’s consult diagnosed me as having multiple fist-sized fibroids which needed surgical intervention.”\nCan my fibroids be something else?\nSymptoms of different gynaecological conditions do tend to overlap. So it can be tough to know exactly what is the reason behind your symptoms without speaking to a medical professional. We have an amazing team of in-house women’s health GPs, who can offer a listening ear for all your struggles and discuss treatment options to alleviate your symptoms. Don’t suffer any longer, your health is very important. Skip the queues and book directly with us today. \nFibroids v Endometriosis \nEndometriosis can similarly cause heavy periods, tummy swelling (bloating), painful periods shooting to the back and legs and infertility. Endometriosis is more difficult to see on an ultrasound, whereas fibroids are often diagnosed on an ultrasound scan. Because fibroids and endometriosis are both common, you could have both – this is where a doctor will talk to you in depth and work out which condition is causing your main symptoms.\nFibroids & Pregnancy \nIn some rare cases, fibroids have been a barrier to conception5. Due to the location or size of the fibroid, it can prevent the egg from nesting in the womb or act as a barrier to fertilisation. Submucosal fibroids might also block the fallopian tube, affecting the egg’s ability to reach the uterus to meet the sperm. \nHowever, this does not mean you cannot get pregnant or carry a baby to term with a fibroid. It is not clear cut and the management of fibroids during pregnancy can vary case by case. There’s a lot more about fibroids and pregnancy to learn about in our other article. \nFibroids after menopause: Symptoms\nFibroids are notoriously oestrogen-dependent. The key marker of menopause is the decline in oestrogen. Put them both together, this means as our oestrogen levels slowly drop during perimenopause and menopause, your fibroids are likely to shrink as well and so your symptoms should improve6, hurrah!\nSummary\nFibroids affect us differently. There are no set symptoms associated with fibroids but heavy bleeding is the most common symptom. Medical advancements have come a long way and there are a variety of treatment types that can ease your bothersome symptoms. \nIt is important you reach out to your doctor for help in managing these symptoms, you do not have to suffer in silence.\n",

        "Title": "What are fibroids?",
        "Content": "What are fibroids? \n70% of women1 develop fibroids at some point in their life. \nFibroids are essentially tumours that grow from the muscular and connective tissue of the womb. The word tumour sounds scary but do not worry, fibroids are classed as non-cancerous growths2 and they also do not increase your risk of cancer3. To reassure you more, over 99% of fibroids are benign3 ! \nYou might hear your doctor referring to fibroids as leiomyomas or uterine myomas. They can grow to varying sizes and you may have just 1 or several in your uterus.\nThere are 4 main types of fibroids4:\n\nIntramural \nSubmucosal \nSubserosal \nPedunculated\n\nYes, we know these are complicated words, but if you are interested in learning more about the differences, head on over to our article on the types of fibroids. \nSo now you know what are they, let’s dig deeper into the causes and symptoms of fibroids.\nWhat causes fibroids? Am I at risk of fibroids? \nAs with most conditions in medicine, the specific reason fibroids grow is not exactly known but we do believe there is a link with our mighty hormone oestrogen2,3. \nThe abnormal muscle cells growing from the uterus are oestrogen dependent so when they are in contact with oestrogen, these cells multiply further5. When our oestrogen levels are at their highest, the risk of developing fibroids is the highest. This is why fibroids are more common in individuals of reproductive age (16-50 years old). After menopause, as our oestrogen levels decline, usually so does the size of the fibroids6. \nGenetics can also play a role in increasing your risk of fibroids. If your mother had fibroids7, you are more likely to have fibroids. \nDid you know, soybeans are high in oestrogen? Some preliminary research has found a link between eating more soy products with fibroids. With this century’s shift towards alternative milk, we might need more research into this area8…. \nHow do I know if I have fibroids?\nUnlike some other gynaecological conditions, fibroids can be easily picked up on a pelvic exam or ultrasound scan of the uterus. \nFibroids present typically with:\n\nMenorrhagia (heavy periods)\nAbdominal pain and lower back pain (if they’re large, fibroids can press on surrounding organs in the abdomen causing this pain)\nFeeling the need to pass urine more (if the fibroid is large, it can put pressure on the bladder)\nDizziness/tiredness (due to losing more blood during your period)\nBleeding between your periods (known to doctors as intermenstrual bleeding)\nInfertility (in rare cases, if the fibroids are too large, the uterus cannot support a growing pregnancy)\n\nThere is no specific set of symptoms you might experience with fibroids, your experience is totally unique, but the ones listed above are common. The severity of symptoms differs between individuals depending on the size of the fibroids and where they are. Fibroids can grow very large and start impacting the quality of your life. It is important to remember that if you are suffering from these symptoms, to be gentle with yourself and seek help.\nIf these symptoms resonate with you and your period struggles, skip the long waiting lines and reach out to one of our women’s health GPs today. We are a safe space to talk through your experiences. There are treatment options available, and you do not have to tolerate these symptoms. \nWhat treatments are there for fibroids? \nSome people might not have any symptoms with their fibroids so don’t actually need any treatment. Keep an eye on your health, if you notice fibroid symptoms developing, arrange another meeting with your doctor. \nTreatment can be divided into9:\n\nMedical \nHormonal \nSurgical procedures\nNon-surgical procedures \n\nTreatments should be tailored to the symptoms you experience, the size of your fibroids and what part of life you are in. \nMedical treatments include tranexamic acid, like Evana, or mefenamic acid, are oral medications that reduce heavy bleeding, usually the commonest symptom of fibroids. If you are not keen on hormones or contraception, these options could suit you. \nIf you are looking at contraceptives, they can also double up as a treatment for fibroids. Contraceptives thin the lining of the uterus which also lightens periods. Options include the hormonal coil (Mirena, Levosert or Benilexa), implant (Nexplanon), injection (Depo-Provera or Sayana Press) or the contraceptive pill (combined and progestogen-only). Sometimes, the hormonal coil needs to be inserted by a gynaecologist if your fibroids are large. Not all contraceptives will suit everyone equally, some users have noticed an improvement in their fibroid symptoms while others report it has only helped their situation a bit. Our contraception reviews have been designed specifically for this reason, to give you more information so you can make an informed decision about your health.\n\n\n\nSometimes these options might not be helping enough, so your GP will likely refer you to a specialist. They may offer you other medications; gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRHas) or ulipristal acetate which reduces the size of the fibroids and therefore the bleeding flow. Reducing the size of the fibroids can also reduce any pressure symptoms like back pain or frequent urination. These medications are only prescribed in short courses or before surgery to shrink the fibroids. \nSurgery is usually a last-line option for failed oral/hormonal treatments, large fibroids or severe symptoms. Surgery can either remove the fibroid itself (myomectomy) or the uterus as a whole (hysterectomy). With the advancements in medicine, we have also developed non-surgical procedures. These involve blocking the blood supply to the fibroids to shrink them (uterine artery embolism) or removing the lining of the uterus (endometrial ablation). \nWe understand this is a lot of information to take in all at once. The good thing is that your doctor will take you through the various treatment options, accounting for your personal preferences and what is suitable for your fibroids. However, if you feel at any point that you are not being listened to you can take some time to do your research before making a decision.\nCould it be something else?\nGynaecological conditions do overlap in symptoms so you might be scratching your head wondering if it could be something other than fibroids. \nFibroids vs polyps  \nFibroids and polyps are both uterine growths, but it is made up of different tissue types. Fibroids are made of muscular and connective tissue while polyps are made from the womb lining (think the lining that sheds during our period). Polyps are usually benign but can progress to pre-cancer or cancer. They remain small in size and rarely grow larger than a few centimetres. This is why polyps are generally removed and tested to reduce the risk of any progression to a cancer. Polyps can present also with heavy menstrual bleeding, bleeding between periods and infertility. Just like fibroids, polyps can be easily picked up on ultrasound scans10. \nFibroids vs Endometriosis \nFibroids and endometriosis have different causes but they do overlap in symptoms. Fibroids are benign growths of the uterine muscle wall while endometriosis is a condition whereby endometrial-like cells are also found outside the uterus (eg. ovaries, fallopian tube and bowel). Fibroids and endometriosis both can be associated with heavy periods, abdominal and back pain and infertility. If you resonate with the symptoms of endometriosis, many of our users have openly shared their lived experiences to spread awareness of the condition – have a read and see whether you think it describes you too.\nThank you for joining us on this whistle-stop tour of fibroids. We will be diving deeper into the types of fibroids, symptoms, treatment options and effects on pregnancy. \n",

        "Title": "Menopause fatigue: What’s causing tiredness and how can it be treated?",
        "Content": "\nIs it menopause or something else causing tiredness?\nTiredness, fatigue and feeling mentally exhausted are recognised symptoms of perimenopause and menopause. However, lots of different medical conditions can cause tiredness. It’s a symptom which is not very specific to a health condition. Some other very common reason for tiredness among women in their 20s/30s/40s and 50s are:\n\nLow iron and anaemia\nLow vitamin D\nLow B12\nHypothyroidism\nDepression\n\nAnd that’s not even mentioning general life – work, friends, elderly parents, kids, housework…..managing all these aspects of life can cause fatigue and mental exhaustion.\nIf your tiredness is a menopause symptom, it’s most likely that you will have other menopausal symptoms as well. If you’d like to know more about menopausal symptoms (there’s a lot of them) you can read more about them here. Some common menopausal symptoms include:\n\nSleeping problems\nHot flushes\nNight sweats\nJoint pain\nChanges to mood \nChanges to memory\nVaginal dryness\nPainful sex\n\nWhy does menopause cause fatigue?\nMenopause symptoms are caused by falling oestrogen levels. As we age, our ovaries gradually start to release less eggs. Eventually they stop releasing eggs all together, and our periods stop. With this, our oestrogen levels change and fall over time. This drop in oestrogen can have a wide range of effects on the body, because almost every cell has oestrogen receptors. \nFeeling tired, mentally or physically, is a commonly reported menopause symptom in our experiences area. We collect information from real women on what they actually experienced in perimenopause and menopause, and when they tried different treatments. As of June 2024 – the most commonly reported symptom in our reviews was mental fatigue. With a whopping 94% of women experiencing this. All of these women also reported other menopausal symptoms alongside this. \nIn addition to our falling oestrogen levels, we are also aging as we transition through menopause. Getting older in general can cause people to feel more tired than they are used to, and fatigue can be an early indicator of ageing1. However, as women we live ⅓ of our lives after the menopause (about 30 years) and it should be possible to live those years in good health and without feeling tired all the time. \nHow to check if your tiredness is due to menopause?\nUnfortunately, there is not a simple blood test to check for menopause if you’re over the age of 40. Rather, perimenopause and menopause is generally identified through your symptom patterns and their age. \nIf you go to a doctor with only symptoms of tiredness, they may not immediately think of menopause. Your doctor will ask you lots of questions to make sure they identify and rule out any potentially worrying causes of the fatigue. They may run blood tests to check for anaemia, low iron, low vitamin levels, look for inflammatory or autoimmune conditions and to check your thyroid function. This is useful even if your symptoms are due to menopause, as if all your blood test results are normal you can rule out these other causes. \nWhat your doctor will check will be very much based on your own individual symptoms, your personal health history, your family history and what’s currently going on in your life. If you think your symptoms are due to menopause, a useful tip is to track them. This can help you to identify the full symptom list, and any patterns in your symptoms. You can then speak to your GP about exactly what’s been happening for you over the recent weeks. We’ve created a really great guide for how to have these discussions with your doctor. \n\nHow to manage menopausal tiredness\nIf you’re experiencing tiredness, it’s important to examine the root cause with your GP. If menopause is not the cause of your tiredness, they will be able to treat you accordingly. \nIf you and your GP decide that your tiredness is likely a menopausal symptom, they will talk you through a range of different treatment options. The options you are offered will be based on your personal medical history. \nSome non-medical treatments which may help with your tiredness are – changes to your diet and exercise routine or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). There is extensive evidence that lifestyle changes can reduce menopausal symptoms2,3,4. \nAlongside this, it’s also worth talking to colleagues, friends and family about how you are feeling. Sometimes even removing a couple of responsibilities or tasks from your mental load can make a huge difference to your energy levels.\nMedical treatments which can help menopause symptoms are:\n\nHormone replacement therapy\nCertain forms of antidepressants may help with hot flushes, night sweats and mood changes. These should be offered after HRT, if you don’t want to take HRT or if you can not take HRT due to health risks. \n\nSo, if you’re feeling tired all the time\nIt’s not normal to constantly feel tired. As women, we often have a lot going on. But don’t just put up with feeling tired all the time. There are many different things which could cause this symptom, including changes to your hormones which happen during menopause. It’s important to speak to a doctor about your full list of symptoms, and to let them help find the root cause of your tiredness. For some people, a mixture of things might be contributing to how they’re feeling, so it’s always important to speak with a health professional about this. \n\n",

        "Title": "Tips from a doctor: How to increase your fertility",
        "Content": "\nWhat does TTC mean?\nTrying to conceive (TTC) means that you and your partner are actively trying to get pregnant. We know this involves much more than simply having unprotected sex and can be a physically and mentally challenging journey. Sharing experiences can be incredibly helpful; check out our trying to conceive platform and you’ll find that you’re not alone, no matter what you’re going through.\nWhile some women are fortunate enough to fall pregnant within a few months, others can be trying for much longer. Although we can’t specify an exact timeframe, we do know that more than 80% of couples, with no pre-existing fertility problems, usually conceive within 12 months if they’re having regular unprotected sex. For more on this, check out our detailed blog on how long it actually takes to get pregnant. \nWhy is it important to understand your menstrual cycle? \nConception is more likely to happen if you have sex around the time you ovulate (when a mature egg is released from the ovary.) The British Fertility Society highlights that the chance of pregnancy is 26% if you have sex two days before ovulation, dropping to 1% if sex occurs one day or more after you’ve ovulated1. If you have a 28-day cycle, an egg will be released around 2 weeks before the start of your next period. Otherwise, to predict your ovulation date, you can subtract 14 days from the length of your cycle, or find an ovulation calculator online. Bear in mind that this is only an estimate, so it’s best to have sex regularly for a few days before and after to maximise your chances of success. \nWhat does regular unprotected sex actually mean?\nDon’t fall into the trap of limiting sex to try to ‘save sperm’. The latest fertility guidelines recommend couples wanting to conceive should have sex every two to three days, without using contraception2. That being said, having sex too often can lead to burnout; it’s important to find a happy medium that keeps sex joyful and stops it from becoming a chore! There’s no evidence to support a favoured sex position, so just stick to what feels good and what you and your partner enjoy. \nWhat about ovulation tests? \nOur fertility hormones luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) fluctuate throughout the menstrual cycle and are responsible for some of the changes we might notice around the time of ovulation. Cervical mucus will often increase and become clear and slippery just before ovulation (think egg whites!) making it easier for sperm to pass through. It will be dryer and thicker at other times of your cycle. Due to the hormone progestogen, our basal body temperature (BBT) also rises after ovulation, usually by half a degree. Some women also say their sense of smell increases, but this is a less reliable indicator.\nBodily changes are subtle and easily missed, so understandably some women might want the extra reassurance that an Ovulation Predictor Kit (OPK) provides. These tests are similar to a pregnancy test but instead of detecting the pregnancy hormone HCG in urine, they detect LH. LH surges 24-36 hours before ovulation occurs and remains elevated for 14-27 hours afterwards. This rise in LH triggers the release of an egg from the ovary. No test is 100% accurate but OKPs come pretty close; they can help you to increase your odds of pregnancy by identifying when conception is most likely to occur and timing sex accordingly3. With so many different brands available, the amount of choice can make it seem overwhelming, but the essential function remains consistent across most kits. Just remember to follow the exact instructions for the test that you buy, as they are all slightly different.\nWhat can you do to improve your fertility? \nFertility issues are thought to affect one in six couples in the UK4. Age, genetics, diet, alcohol, stress, activity, weight and caffeine can all impact our ability to conceive. Some factors, like our age and DNA, are out of our control – but we do have the power to make simple lifestyle changes to get our fertility back on track. These include:\n🍻 Cutting out alcohol5 \n🚭 Stopping smoking6 \n⚖️ Maintaining a healthy BMI (a measure of whether you are a healthy weight for your height) of between 19 and 257,8 ,\n🏃 Exercising regularly (but avoiding excessive or extreme workouts)9 \n🧠   Managing stress10 \n☕ Limiting caffeine to 200mg per day11,12 ,\n🥦 Eating a varied diet rich in wholegrains, legumes, fruit, vegetables and unsaturated fats (ie. lots of olive oil and avocado!)13,14,15 \n💊  Supplementing with 10 micrograms of vitamin D daily16\nWhat other supplements do you actually need? \nTaking folic acid daily for at least 3 months before you get pregnant (and for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy) is essential to reduce the risk of your baby developing a neural tube defect such as spina bifida. For most women, 400 micrograms is required, but always check with your doctor as some women will require a higher dose of 5mg per day. We can get most other vitamins in sufficient quantities from food, so additional supplements are not necessary. Some vitamins, like vitamin A, can be harmful in pregnancy and are best avoided. \nFor those of you with PCOS, Dr Melanie Davis-Hall gives us the scoop on whether also supplementing with inositol can regulate your menstrual cycle and improve fertility outcomes.\nWhat about TTC with PCOS or endometriosis?\nIf you are known to have PCOS or endometriosis, it’s completely underdstandable that you might be worried about getting pregnant. It’s a complex topic and we’ve delved deeper into fertility with PCOS or endometriosis in other blogs. \nSo, what next? \nWhether you’re simply curious, thinking about or already trying to conceive, the Lowdown is here to listen, advise and support you on your path to parenthood. You can try our fertility quiz and get a personalised guide to help optimise your reproductive health, or you can arrange to speak to one of our women’s health experts.\n\n\n\n",

        "Content": "\nWhy stop HRT?\nThe first decision to make if you are considering stopping HRT is whether stopping is the right choice for you. In general, women and people AFAB take hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to help with symptoms of the perimenopause and menopause. The perimenopause, leading to the menopause, is a time of change and transition in your hormones that can cause many different symptoms. As HRT is generally prescribed to improve your quality of life, starting and stopping HRT is a personal decision for you to make together with your doctor. The bottom line is you can continue HRT for as long as the benefits to you in terms of how you feel outweigh the small risks of HRT treatment. So, you may choose to stop if: \n\nYou aren’t getting enough benefit (for example if you are struggling with side effects, find HRT is not treating your symptoms effectively or want to see how you feel off HRT)\nThe risks of taking HRT outweigh potential benefits to you.\n\nHow long can I take HRT for?\nThe good news is that you can take HRT for as long as you find it makes you feel better, so long as you have annual checks and your risks of taking HRT stay low. Some individuals find HRT most useful during the period of transition and flux of the perimenopause and want to stop afterwards. However, some people also find they continue to feel a lot better taking HRT even after they have transitioned into the post-menopausal period and therefore want to continue HRT treatment in the longer term. This is reflected in The Lowdown’s review community – people writing reviews on HRT are in their 60s and 70s as well as their 40s and 50s. We now know HRT, particularly when started before the age of 60, is generally safe to take in the longer term (your doctor can advise you further, or you can book an appointment with a menopause specialist here). The latest UK guidelines (2022) on the menopause  make it clear that ‘there is no arbitrary limit for duration of HRT use.’1 Having spent time working in a specialist menopause clinic, I know first-hand that the experience of perimenopause, menopause and postmenopause varies hugely between individuals, and some people benefit from HRT for much longer than just the years around the menopause. My own grandma still takes HRT and feels great for it – and she is now in her 90s! \nWhen to stop HRT?\nIt’s personal! So let’s look at a common scenario where you might consider stopping HRT. Let’s imagine a woman, aged 53, who has been taking combined HRT primarily for relief from disabling hot flushes and night sweats. She has found HRT very effective at managing those symptoms, thankfully with few side effects, but she is now wondering if she could stop HRT as this would be her preference. Current UK guidelines suggest most women taking HRT primarily for hot flushes and night sweats (also known as vasomotor symptoms), will need 2-5 years of treatment.2 Hot flushes and night sweats are just one of over 30 symptoms that can be experienced during the perimenopause and menopause.  \nLet’s say she has been taking HRT for around 4 years and is keen to try and stop. So, this is a reasonable time for her to try coming off and seeing what happens. The key thing to know is that everyone is different. She might try coming off and find that she no longer experiences her disabling symptoms and feels well off HRT. However, her symptoms might recur and she may want to take HRT for longer. \nIf you have POI, however, it’s recommended that you take HRT until at least the average age of natural menopause in the UK, which is 51.3\nHow to stop HRT\nIf you have chosen to stop HRT, you have two main options. You can stop HRT suddenly, or gradually reduce your HRT dose down over 3-6 months. The evidence from studies to date suggests that there will be no difference to your long-term symptoms with either way of stopping.4 However, if you stop HRT suddenly, your symptoms are likely to return faster than if you stop gradually. So again, this is a personal choice. If you are really struggling with side effects from HRT itself, stopping suddenly may feel like the best option. If you are curious to see how you might feel off HRT, it may feel that gradually lowering the dose may be the best way to investigate this without running the risk of a sudden rebound in your symptoms. Your healthcare professional can provide you with more advice or you can book an appointment with a menopause specialist.\nWhat to expect while coming off HRT and after\nTo understand what to expect as you stop HRT, it might be helpful to think about where your body is in the menopause journey. Some symptoms of the perimenopause arise from oestrogen levels ping-ponging up and down as the number of eggs in your ovaries reduces. Typically this can cause mood changes, headaches, hot flushes and night sweats. As your body enters the menopause and post-menopause, these fluctuations will settle down, and you will have stable, but lower levels of oestrogen and progesterone. Other symptoms of the perimenopause and post-menopausal period, such as genito-urinary syndrome of menopause, are mainly caused by these lower oestrogen levels in the run up to and after the menopause. \nSo if your symptoms have primarily been related to ping-ponging hormones in the perimenopause, if you stop HRT and you have reached a post-menopausal state, you may well find your symptoms are improved, hooray! However, if your symptoms are primarily driven by low oestrogen levels, then unfortunately these symptoms are likely to recur when you stop HRT.\nIs there hope? Of course! Think about whether stopping HRT is the right choice for you, and you can consider restarting HRT if you have stopped it. If you are getting really challenging side effects from HRT, HRT is no longer safe for you to take, or you don’t want to take HRT any more there are also several medical, non-hormonal treatments as well as lifestyle measures that your doctor can discuss with you. Remember even if full HRT (e.g. tablets, patches) is no longer an option for you, vaginal oestrogen (known as ‘topical’ HRT) is often still safe and can be really helpful with symptoms of genito-urinary syndrome of menopause. There is a wealth of information and treatment options for the perimenopause and menopause – so it really is worth seeing a menopause specialist through your GP or privately if you are suffering.\nHave you found this helpful?

        "Content": "\nHow does Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) work?\nDuring perimenopause and menopause, your hormone levels change. In perimenopause, the number of eggs left in your ovaries dwindles so your hormone levels start to swing up and down desperately trying to force your ovary to release an egg. The main hormone which fluctuates is oestrogen, as shown in the graph below. \n\nOver time, your oestrogen levels drop to a lower level overall. As you pass through menopause, and into the post menopausal phase of life, your oestrogen hormone levels will be at a much lower level. The changes to your oestrogen hormone levels across perimenopause and menopause can cause symptoms. Approximately 85% of women will experience some kind of symptom. \nFor some, these symptoms will have a really significant impact on quality of life. Menopausal symptoms are treatable, with a number of different medical treatments and lifestyle changes. The most common, and the most effective, treatment for menopausal symptoms is called hormone replacement therapy (HRT). In the US, this is sometimes called menopausal hormone therapy (MHT). \nHow long do different methods of HRT take to work?\nIt can take up to 3 months for your HRT to work. In general, doctors will give a 3 month prescription initially to allow you to try HRT. This will be of one form of the oestrogen HRT, alongside a progesterone if you have a womb. \nWithin 3 months you should be noticing some improvements to your symptoms. These can be hard to notice, so it’s worth tracking them (even if just using a pen and paper) to see if it’s working. \n\nWhen you add in new hormones to the body, it can take a while for your body to adjust. This can include getting some side effects in the first 3 months. The advice is to be patient until the 3 month mark, as the side effects may subside once your oestrogen levels have been topped up to a more consistent level using HRT. \nIf you’re having bad side effects between 3-6 months, or you are not seeing improvements to your symptoms, you should see your doctor. This might be because the type of HRT you’ve been given doesn’t suit your body well. The good news is that there are lots of different types and doses of oestrogen HRT that you can try, and there are different forms of progesterone if you get side effects related to progesterone. \nWith testosterone HRT, it can take up to 6 months to feel the benefits2. If, after 6 months, it is not adding anything then your healthcare practitioner may suggest coming off it. They will monitor your testosterone levels with blood tests to check you’re within a normal range. \nHow long should you try HRT before noticing a difference?\nIf your symptoms are significantly impacting your quality of life, and it’s safe for you to have HRT, persisting with it for at least 3 months is advised. At 3 months, doctors can tweak your dose or change the form of HRT you are using to see if things improve. If you’re having no benefits at 3 months, they may also run a blood test to check that you are absorbing the oestrogen properly. \nSigns your HRT is or isn’t working\nIf you track your symptoms over the first 3 months, and nothing improves (or things get worse) then at 3 months you can conclude that HRT is not working as would normally be expected. This is usually because oestrogen is not being absorbed into your bloodstream with the form you are taking. This happens to some women, and not others. For example, some women may not absorb oestrogen well through a patch on the skin, for other women, they may find their skin does not absorb enough of the hormone from the gel. This might mean that the woman should increase the amount of gel (as advised by their doctor) or try a switch to a different patch, spray or tablet form of oestrogen.\nIf things aren’t working at the 3 month mark, then most doctors recommend making some kind of adjustment to dose or method and trying for another 3 months. Hopefully things will improve, and for many women they will feel improvements within 3-6 months. For some women, this adjustment process can take longer than 3 months. At the end of the day, it’s up to you how long you want to try HRT for based on the benefits you get. Tweaking and adjusting HRT is quite a complex process, and so it should always be done with your doctor. \nAt what point do you decide the HRT is not working for you?\nThis is very individual, and it will likely depend on how severe your symptoms are and how much (if any) relief HRT is giving you. There are a number of different forms of HRT, and different doses, which you can try to get the right combination for you. Many women will keep trying for many months. If you do find the right balance of HRT, often it’s worth the wait. If you’re looking to understand more about women’s real life experiences of HRT you can learn more from our lived experiences and HRT reviews.\nAnd finally, how to change your HRT\nIf you’re not happy with your current HRT, or are struggling with side effects, do consult your doctor after you’ve been taking it for 3 months. We know it can be hard to be patient, but often if you book in an appointment just a few weeks after starting HRT, the advice will be to come back at 3 months. Some women do experience side effects on HRT initially, and for a small number of women these might be quite bad. Side effects should generally subside within 3-6 months of starting HRT, once your body has adjusted to the higher hormone levels. So try to keep going if you can! However, if you are really worried then always do try to speak to a doctor. \nIf you’ve got to 3 months, and it’s not working to improve your symptoms, chat to your doctor. They may want to run some blood tests, to check you’re absorbing HRT from the type you’ve been prescribed. Or, they may increase the dose or suggest a different format. Exactly what happens will depend on your personal information, and what you share with your own doctor. For a small number of women, it can be tricky to find the right HRT. It’s important that all adjustments to your HRT are done with your doctor, as lots of different factors can be at play. Increasing the dose at home on your own is definitely not advised! If you’re feeling stuck, you can always book in with a menopause specialist.\nGood luck with your HRT. And remember, we have reviews of every different type of HRT available in the UK for you to browse. Reading the experiences of other women can help you to make more informed choices, or have more informed conversations with your doctor. And remember, HRT isn’t everything, there’s other ways to help with your menopausal symptoms!\n\n\n\n",

        "Title": "When does perimenopause start?",
        "Content": "\nWhat is perimenopause?\nThe perimenopause is the period leading up to your last period. It’s a time when your hormones (oestrogen and progesterone in particular) are fluctuating because your ovaries have fewer eggs and the hormones are having to work harder to make your ovaries release an egg each month. As a result, many women get hormonal symptoms during this time. The changes in estrogen cause the majority of symptoms. This graph shows how oestrogen levels change throughout perimenopause and as you move into menopause. \n\nHow do I know when I’ve started perimenopause?\nPerimenopause is a cluster of different symptoms, unique to the person. There is not one single symptom women get which tells you ‘yep, you’re perimenopause has started’. Perimenopause is much more complicated than that. Most cells in your body have oestrogen receptors. When your oestrogen levels change during perimenopause, this means that many different parts of your physical body and your mental wellbeing can change. \nWhat are the symptoms of perimenopause?\nThere are actually over 34 recognised symptoms of menopause, and many people think there is even more than this. The 34 that most people recognise are:\n\nHot flushes\nNight sweats\nAnxiety\nBrain fog\nPeriod changes\nHeart palpitations or your heart beating suddenly and quickly\nMood swings\nDepression or low mood\nAnxiety\nTearfulness\nBrain fog or memory changes\nIrritability or being short tempered\nPanic attacks\nWeight gain\nLack of confidence\nLow motivation\nChanges to your digestion\nVaginal dryness\nItchy skin\nLow libido \nPainful sex\nBurning or tingling sensations on the skin\nJoint pain\nThinning hair\nDifficulty concentrating\nFeeling tired all the time\nSleep issues \nDry eyes\nBladder issues or urinary incontinence\nRecurrent UTIs\nThinning nails\nBody odour changes\nChanges to taste and smell\nFeeling tired all the time\n\nWhen will I start going through menopause?\nThe majority of women will experience perimenopause symptoms in their 40s and 50s.\n\nAbout 85% of women will experience some kind of symptom during perimenopause1, and for the majority us the perimenopause happens in our 40s or 50s. In the UK and the US, the average age of menopause is 51. As many people experience symptoms for a few years before their periods stop – many women will have symptoms in their 40s. \nAround 5% of women get something called an early menopause – when your periods stop naturally between the ages of 40 and 452. These women may well get perimenopause symptoms in their late 30s. 1% of women will experience menopause under the age of 40, and this is called Premature Ovarian Insufficiency (POI)3. This can happen to women at any age, including teenagers. For these women, they will likely experience menopausal symptoms until they get a diagnosis and onto the correct treatment. Women with POI will be recommended to take hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to protect their bone and heart health. Having enough oestrogen whilst we’re under 40 is important for our overall health and wellbeing, women with POI have naturally much lower levels so they need this to be topped up with HRT. \nIt’s useful to be aware of perimenopause at all times because it can start at any age\nPerimenopause is not a simple condition to diagnose. It’s made up of a wide range of symptoms, and it can start at any age. The majority of women will get perimenopause symptoms in their 40s and early 50s. However, many only really start to recognise symptoms as perimenopausal after their periods stop. By looking back once you’ve been through the menopause, you can often see that you were having symptoms years before your periods stopped. \nDon’t suffer in silence with symptoms. Seek help if you need it. We’re here to support you at the Lowdown with finding the information you need about different treatments and solutions for your symptoms.

It’s a time when your hormones (oestrogen and progesterone in particular) are fluctuating because your ovaries start to produce less eggs. As a result, many women get hormonal symptoms during this time. There is not a fixed, specific age when perimenopause symptoms start. It will be different for everyone. Roughly 85% of women will experience some kind of symptom during perimenopause1, and for the majority us perimenopause happens in our 40s or 50s. \nWhen is the menopause?\nThe menopause itself is actually a single day, and then you move into a postmenopausal phase. Menopause is when your periods have stopped for a full year, for reasons which are not surgical or medical. Menopause usually starts between the ages of 45 and 56 years 2 The average age of menopause is 51 in the UK3 and the US2. After your periods have stopped for a year, you transition into a postmenopausal phase. You may live in the postmenopause phase for 20-30 years, or roughly a third of your life. You can still get symptoms during your post menopausal years – many will have symptoms for years during this time. \nAbout 5% of women will have an early natural menopause, occurring between the ages of 40 and 45 years. 31% of women experience primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) which is when you start to experience perimenopause under the age of 40 years3.\nWhat is the average length of menopause?\nData currently suggests that the average length of time women have menopause symptoms is seven years2, but some women will have them for much longer. Every person is unique, and so some will experience symptoms for a much shorter time or not at all. There are also a number of unlucky women who will have symptoms for 15 years or more. \nThere are some factors which influence how long you will experience menopause symptoms for, including:\n\nSmoking status – if you smoke, you may have worse symptoms\nLifestyle factors like exercise and diet\nEthnicity\nAge your menopause starts. \n\nIf you’re looking to understand more about menopause symptoms, you can learn more here. \nDo different ethnicities have different menopausal symptoms?\nThere is data to suggest that different ethnic groups will have different symptoms during menopause\n\nBlack and Hispanic women have more frequent rates of premature and early menopause than Caucasian women. The incidence of premature menopause in Black and Hispanic women is 1.4% versus 1% for Caucasian women.5\nThe incidence of early menopause (between 40-45) in Black and Hispanic women is 3.7% to 4.1% compared to 2.9% for white women. However, when confounding factors are considered, race does not seem to contribute to the differences in the timing of menopause for a specific individual. It’s only on a whole population level that this is seen.5\nBlack women suffer more with vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes, night sweats, heart palpitations) than other racial groups. 80% of Black women experience vasomotor symptoms, and the median duration is 10.1 years. This is compared to only 65% of Caucasian women getting flushes and sweats, with a median duration of 6.5 years.6\n\nIt’s very important to understand how different ethnicities experience menopause, so that we ensure everyone gets the appropriate care. The world needs more data collected on menopause. If you’d like to tell your menopause story and share your experience with The Lowdown, you will be helping other women feel less alone and advancing researchers’ understanding of real women’s experiences. \nSo, how do I know what to expect?\nEvery menopause is different. If you’re struggling with symptoms, it’s important to seek help from a healthcare professional. Symptoms can last for years, and so you don’t want to struggle through without support. Even if they don’t last for long, there’s no harm in taking steps to look after yourself as you enter perimenopause and transition through menopause. The lifestyle and treatment choices you make at this point in life can have big positive impacts on your long term health. \nIf you’re struggling, there’s help. You can start by speaking to your GP, or our menopause specialists at Myla Health.\n\n\n\n",

        "Title": "What is a Decidual Cast",
        "Content": "\nHave you heard of a decidual cast? While it’s thankfully rare, passing a fleshy lump in the shape of the womb can be a painful and anxiety-provoking situation. Here’s some more information about what a decidual cast is, what causes it, and what to do if it happens to you. If you’ve experienced a decidual cast, let us know and share your experience to help other The Lowdown readers.\nWhat happens during a typical menstrual period?\nLet’s refresh our minds about what happens during the menstrual cycle, the process of growth and shedding of the womb (uterus) lining (endometrium) in response to the development and release of follicles from the ovaries. Thinking about decidual casts, it’s particularly useful to consider what’s happening to the womb lining during the cycle.\nDay one of the menstrual cycle is the first day of a period, where the endometrial lining is shed. During your period, levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH) increase, and in turn, they stimulate the ovaries to develop follicles. As one ‘dominant’ follicle grows, oestrogen levels increase and act on the womb, causing the lining to repair and regrow. Ovulation happens on day 14 when the follicle is released from the ovary, and the endometrium prepares for implantation. Over the next 14 days, the unfertilised follicle (corpus luteum) regresses, causing a drop in oestrogen and progesterone levels, leading to the shedding of the endometrium over the next 5-7 days – your period.\nWhat is a decidual cast?\nThe term ‘decidual cast’ literally means a model or replica of the lining of the womb. The decidua is the outermost part of the endometrium, which is primed to receive a fertilised egg, and it would begin to form the placenta if a pregnancy were to progress. It’s this decidua which is lost during a normal period, and usually it is lost slowly and steadily, causing bleeding over the course of 5-7 days. However, very rarely, the body can shed the womb lining in one piece, or sometimes several large pieces. When this happens, this type of menstrual loss is called a ‘decidual cast.\nWhat does it look like?\nA decidual cast can be shed in one piece of tissue (red/pink fleshy material), which may keep the shape of the womb1 (a triangle). Alternatively, it can be shed in several larger pieces. These pieces can look like fleshy lumps within the period or large blood clots. It can be worth taking a photo to show your doctor.\nIs it dangerous, should I worry?\nDecidual casts are rare, but not normally anything to worry about, although passing one can be painful. However, changes to your periods or new clots or lumps can be signs of other problems, and you should see your doctor. Losing blood, clots or tissue like a decidual cast can be a sign of a problem during pregnancy and certainly needs checking by a healthcare professional.\nWhat causes a decidual cast?\nWe don’t know exactly what causes decidual casts to form. There does seem to be a link to progesterone use in various hormonal contraceptives, some links to pregnancy complications including ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage and post-partum haemorrhage2. A recent study has also linked high stress levels with formation of decidual casts3. Sometimes a decidual cast can form with no clear cause.\nIs a decidual cast related to pregnancy loss?\nDecidual casts have been found to be linked with ectopic pregnancy. It is thought that changes to hormone levels following an ectopic pregnancy can affect the stability of the womb lining and increase the chance of forming a decidual cast4.\nIs a decidual cast linked with birth control?\nWe know that formation of decidual casts is associated with progesterone. This is the hormone which controls the thickness of the lining of the womb, and some contraceptive methods containing progesterone can therefore increase the odds of forming a decidual cast.\nWhat types of contraception/birth control are decidual casts linked to?\nDecidual casts are most commonly associated with progesterone-containing contraceptive methods, including the depot injection and the progesterone-only pill1. More rarely, use of a combined oral contraceptive pill5 has been linked with decidual cast formation. Decidual casts can form after starting or stopping a new method of contraception6.\nWhen should I see a doctor?\nYou should see your doctor if you notice any changes to your periods, including heavy or painful periods, as well as abnormalities including clots or tissue lumps like a decidual cast. Your doctor will help rule out any more sinister causes of bleeding changes and hopefully reassure, as well as help you with any pain experienced with a decidual cast.\nIf you’ve experienced a decidual cast related to contraception, don’t forget to share your experience to help others!\n\n",

It acts to reduce blood sugar levels in two ways¹: \n\nby reducing the amount of sugar released by the liver\nby increasing our bodies ability to absorb sugar from the bloodstream into cells (through better sensitivity to insulin) \n\nWhat is “Insulin Resistance” in PCOS?\nMost people with PCOS also have insulin resistance. The information on social media surrounding insulin resistance and PCOS can be quite overwhelming at times! \nSo to clear things up, insulin resistance can be explained by the following²:\n\nWhen we eat foods such as carbohydrates, they are converted into sugar which goes into the bloodstream\nInsulin acts like a key, to open cell doors to this sugar and allow our body to process it. When someone has insulin resistance, the body’s cells don’t respond as they should to this insulin. Therefore, the body can’t process the sugar and blood sugar levels remain high. \nThe body will generally produce higher levels of insulin to try and overcome this. \nThis may keep blood sugars normal for a while, but most people with insulin resistance can eventually go on to develop hyperglycaemia (higher than normal blood sugar levels). This is sometimes referred to as impaired glucose tolerance. \n\nInsulin resistance is traditionally associated with diabetes, but it also plays a very important role in the development of PCOS and its symptoms³. The resulting high levels of insulin in the blood causes the body to produce more hormones like testosterone, leading to some of the symptoms of PCOS eg excessive hair growth and acne. Insulin resistance is also closely linked with some of the long term health consequences of PCOS such as type 2 diabetes and diabetes in pregnancy⁴. \nMetformin and PCOS\nMetformin can be used in the treatment of PCOS, particularly when symptoms are thought to be closely linked with insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance⁵. This is because in theory, by treating the insulin resistance, this will prevent the resulting hormone changes that cause the symptoms of PCOS.  It can also be considered as a treatment option in women with PCOS who are trying to get pregnant as it can improve ovulation (release of an egg), but this is usually as an additional treatment as other medications (clomifene and letrozole) are known to be better. \nMetformin can be used on its own or in combination with other PCOS treatments. It should always be used alongside the recommended lifestyle changes for PCOS4. \nIt’s use in PCOS is termed as ‘off-label’, because it has only been officially licensed by drug regulators for the treatment of diabetes and not PCOS. \nUse of metformin appears safe long-term, based on the evidence we have from other conditions such as diabetes, however it is thought that the long term benefits in PCOS haven’t been properly studied5.\nIt comes in tablet form, and most people will end up taking one tablet between two to three times a day¹. \nIt’s generally prescribed by a specialist (gynaecologist or endocrinologist), or by a GP following advice from a specialist. \nWho Can Benefit from Metformin?\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) is an organisation that makes recommendations for managing medical conditions in the UK. \nIn their recommendations for PCOS7 they refer to a guideline by the International PCOS Network from 20238 which recommends metformin should be considered in people with a higher metabolic risk. Some examples include; people with a BMI over 25; people with diabetes risk factors; or people with evidence of impaired glucose tolerance. They also recommend it can be used in the management of weight and metabolic outcomes, especially when lifestyle measures alone haven’t done the trick. \nHowever it’s important to do extensive research (like reading this blog!) and to speak to your doctor about whether metformin is right for you. \nWhat are the side effects of metformin?\nLike with any medication, metformin can come with some side effects7. These are mostly relating to stomach upset such as stomach pain, diarrhoea, alongside feeling nauseous or vomiting. These are relatively common symptoms (more than 1 in 10 people) but they mostly happen at the start of treatment. Some doctors recommend therefore spreading your dose throughout the day or taking them with food. Modified release metformin tablets may reduce these side effects.\nHow well does metformin work for PCOS? \nThis is a difficult question to answer, because simple put, there just aren’t that many high quality scientific studies that look at how well metformin works for PCOS. \nMost studies that exist compared it to co-cyprindiol (a type of contraception aka Dianette). A summary of these studies9 has come to the conclusion that there was no major difference between the two in terms of their effect on excessive hair growth and acne (but that is not to say that neither of them work). The contraception was thought to be better at regulating periods. \nWe still don’t have any studies on the effect of metformin on the long term outcomes of PCOS that were mentioned earlier such as type 2 diabetes. \nIn order to choose whether metformin is the right drug for you it’s important to do your own research, discuss with your doctor, and remember that everyone’s approach to their PCOS will be different. If you are looking for specialist support, especially if you’re trying to lose weight or get pregnant using metformin, think about booking in with our specialist partners at Luna Clinic.\n\n\n\n",

        "Content": "\nEndometriosis: what, why, and how?\n10% or 1.5 million women in the UK have endometriosis1. Did you know this is as common as diabetes? Yet there is still so much we don’t know about this gynaecological condition2!\nEndometriosis is a chronic condition characterised by the presence of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus (e.g. ovaries, fallopian tube, bowel) that builds and bleeds just like the uterine lining does during our periods. However, the blood has no place to escape so it stays trapped inside the body until it is broken down by the body’s immune system and inflammatory response. \nYou might be thinking, why and how does this happen? It is still unknown and has only been theorised.  Recently, a new theory has suspected that a bacterial species called Fusobacterium found in the uterus might be a culprit for this disease3.\nWhat are the stages of endometriosis, and how are they classified?\nThe American Society of Reproductive Medicine4 devised a classification system for endometriosis, which basically measures the extent of endometriosis found during a laparoscopy, dividing it into four endometriosis stages.\n\n\n\n\nEndometriosis Stages\nClassification\n\n\nStage 1 endometriosis  \n1-5 superficial endometrial tissues\n\n\nStage 2 endometriosis  \n6-15 endometrial tissues, getting deeper\n\n\nStage 3 endometriosis  \n16-40 endometrial tissues, majority are deep, scarring and ovarian cysts may be present\n\n\nStage 4 endometriosis  \nMore than 40 endometrial tissues, majority are deep, scarring, and ovarian cysts are more severe\n\n\n\n\nWhich endometriosis stage has the worst symptoms?\nA higher stage of endometriosis does not necessarily mean the symptoms are more severe! There is also no specific set of symptoms tied to each stage. Each individual’s experience with the condition varies. \nEndometriosis does not necessarily progress down the stages over time: it could get worse, get better, or remain entirely unchanged5.  One thing we do know is fertility rates tend to decline with higher stages6 due to the presence of ovarian cysts and fallopian tube scarring.\nThe symptoms of endometriosis can range from:\n\nWorse-than-average period pain\nPainful sex\nUncomfortable bowel/urinary movements\nFatigue\nBloating\nHeavy periods\nOvulation pain\nBleeding/spotting outside your period\nInfertility\n\nAre you unsure if your experience is related to endometriosis? The Lowdown has a mighty endometriosis community that have shared their stories about their symptoms, getting a diagnosis, and so much more!\nWhy is endometriosis so tiring?\nIt can be tempting to use the words tired and fatigue interchangeably. However, the difference exists. It is normal to feel tired after a hard day’s work, but if this feeling lingers all the time, this is regarded as fatigue7.\nAs your body is constantly trying to fight the endometriosis, it results in the feeling of fatigue. Earlier, we touched upon how the immune system and inflammatory reactions are triggered. This drains the body’s energy levels without getting a chance to recharge. \nDo I have endometriosis?\nThe gold standard investigation is currently an exploratory laparoscopy surgery, using a camera to look into your tummy to see if any endometrial-like spots can be found outside the uterus. It is unfortunately invasive and comes with possible complications of anaesthesia and surgery. Sometimes, endometrial spots can be found on an ultrasound scan or pelvic MRI scan but these are not always sensitive.\nIf you don’t feel comfortable sharing your story with a doctor as you are concerned you will be dismissed, many in our community can resonate with that. Unfortunately, there have been many cases of medical gaslighting leading to long drawn-out diagnosis timelines. Many sufferers do not have their symptoms acknowledged and pain can be belittled as ‘normal’ menstrual cramping. This might be the reason the journey to receive a diagnosis can take 8-10 years on average in the UK8.\n\nThe Lowdown is here to offer a safe and supportive environment every step of the way! Reach out and ask for advice, that is what we’re here for. Speak to a Lowdown women’s health GP today. \nEndometriosis treatments\nMainstay treatments include9:\n\nPain medication – reduces inflammation\nContraception – regulates or stops menstruation\nSurgery – removes endometrial tissue and scarring\n\nIt is easy to get lost in the world of contraception options. Fear not, if you need a helping hand, use our contraceptive recommender to find an option that suits your body best. \n\nSurgery is usually recommended for stage three or four sufferers, but it does not always minimise the pain and the spots can sometimes regrow. It is also a treatment option to improve the chance of conception, as it can remove ovarian cysts or scar tissue in the fallopian tubes, normally beneficial for stage three or four endometriosis10.\nHowever, there are many alternative therapies now readily available. Lifestyle changes have also been shown to have a benefit in managing endometriosis. Exercise and anti-inflammatory diets have been linked to a reduction in pelvic pain and also fatigue11.\nAs we know, endometriosis is a complex condition with symptoms and severities that affect everyone uniquely. Consider opting for a tailored treatment approach to tackle your symptoms and stage of endometriosis. It’s not one size fits all!\nWhat happens now?\nJust because your experience is unique, that does not mean you are battling this condition alone. The Lowdown was built on the background of our amazing founder who felt isolated in her search for answers about her diagnosis. We have a huge community of endometriosis warriors who constantly band together to support each other’s struggles through their own shared experiences. You might find a tip or two that can transform your life! \n\nIf you’re feeling brave, why not open up about your own experiences?

        "Title": "Signs your HRT is not working for you",
        "Content": "\nHow do you know that your HRT isn’t working for you? Maybe a better first question is “how do I know my HRT is working?”.\nIn premenopausal women, oestrogen is produced largely by your ovaries and in smaller quantities, by fat cells, the lining of blood vessels and bones 1. The perimenopausal sleigh ride, during which time these levels can fluctuate wildly and eventually fall, can cause multiple physical and/or emotional symptoms.\nWhile a lower level of oestrogen is the main change, the decrease in progesterone and testosterone can also contribute to the perimenopausal symptoms experienced 2. HRT seeks to replace the natural decline of these hormones and restore balance.\nYou know your HRT is working when the symptoms that drove you to talk to your doctor, be it troublesome night sweats, insomnia or hot flushes, become manageable or may even resolve. So, what should you do if your symptoms don’t disappear? Or worse still, reappear? Does that mean your HRT isn’t working?\nWhen HRT is started, it is usually at a low dose and this is normally enough to top up dwindling levels of oestrogen for the majority of women 3. If suspected perimenopausal symptoms don’t improve with HRT, it is worth considering and exploring other health conditions and lifestyle issues that might be having an impact. Thyroid imbalance, fibroids, endometrial polyps, excess alcohol consumption, spicy food and stress are amongst the plethora of things that can contribute to and cause similar symptoms to those associated with perimenopause 2.\n“My doctor and I have ruled out other problems, so what’s going on?”\nAs mentioned previously, over time, your body produces less oestrogen and the way in which the level falls is not linear. If your dose of HRT remains the same, it will have the same effect as always 4. However, for some women, doing the same thing just isn’t enough, and a recurrence of symptoms can occur. In such cases, a higher dose of HRT or a change in preparation and/or delivery method may be needed. Since we all have different experiences and absorb medications differently, it is essential to discuss your symptoms with an appropriate healthcare professional and work out if it’s time to try something new.\nHow quickly should you usually expect HRT to take to work?\nIt can take up to three months for HRT to work so patience should be exercised, though thankfully, symptom relief is often experienced before this 5. Factors that can lengthen the time to benefit include:\n\nif you take your medication perfectly or forget doses\nthe type and dose of HRT\nhow severe your symptoms are\nwhat other medications you are taking\nyour medical history\n\nGuidance from the British Menopause Society recommends you to have a review three months after starting HRT with annual reviews thereafter 6. Engaging in this process helps both you and your doctor assess if HRT treatment is working in the way it should and try and iron out any kinks.\nHow long should I wait for side effects of HRT to improve before changing the type?\nCommon side effects of HRT include nausea, irregular bleeding, headaches, heartburn, bloating, breast tenderness, leg cramps, rashes, and acne 7. It can take up to three months for HRT to show benefits, and the above symptoms usually settle within that time. This time also allows you to judge whether any negative side effects outweigh the benefit you’re getting from the HRT.\nOf note, irregular bleeding can prompt a change in the dose of the progesterone component of HRT or a referral to a gynaecology clinic. If there is an increase in the heaviness or duration of your bleeding while using cyclical HRT, or if bleeding continues beyond six months of starting or changing HRT dose while using continuous combined HRT, further tests including a scan may be necessary 8.\nCan HRT suddenly stop working?\nIn short, no. Just as it takes some time for it to start working, it takes time to notice the lack of benefit. This is usually because of an incorrect dosage or using a form of HRT that your body doesn’t absorb well.\nCan HRT give me a new side effect?\nYou may experience different side effects if you change from one form of delivery to another, for example, a tablet and gel combination to a patch or increase your dose but this is not a certainty. If you suddenly develop a new side effect, this might be a sign of something else – so check it out with your healthcare professional.\nHow to tell if my dose is too low or too high?\nIf your original perimenopausal symptoms return, this could suggest your dose of HRT is too low. Extreme side effects or a particularly long duration of side effects could indicate your dose is too high. There is a medical term called “tachyphylaxis” which means that women feel their symptoms aren’t controlled so request higher and higher doses of oestrogen. In fact. These higher doses of oestrogen can mean that women still feel perimenopausal symptoms, and may even worsen symptoms. This is why HRT prescribing has to be so individualised to make sure you’re on the right dose to control your perimenopause, but not make things worse! Please talk through your symptoms with your doctor, or our specialists at Myla health.\n\n\n",

        "Content": "\n\nWhy do we get symptoms at perimenopause and menopause?\nAs we get older, the way our ovaries work changes. When you are older, your ovaries may not  release an egg in every monthly cycle. This changes how our hormones behave, and means that oestrogen and progesterone levels can start to vary and fluctuate wildly. These unpredictable swings in our hormones can cause symptoms. The graph below shows how our oestrogen levels change as we start perimenopause, and then after menopause when we’ve had 1 year without periods. \nOestrogen is a very important hormone for women. There are receptors for the oestrogen hormone in almost every cell in the body. This means that when oestrogen levels start to change and vary a lot, symptoms can pop up. These symptoms are really varied. One of the most common symptoms, as you might expect, is changes to your periods. This can be both bleeding patterns, and heaviness of bleeding. \n\nThe most well known, well discussed, symptoms of menopause are probably hot flushes and night sweats\nMany women will have heard of hot flushes and night sweats during menopause and perimenopause. This is for good reason. Hot flushes and night sweats are quite specific to the menopause transition. Therefore they are easy symptoms for doctors to recognise perimenopause and menopause. A lot of the other symptoms of menopause are less specific, and can also be linked to other health conditions.\nThis does not mean that you need to have hot flushes or night sweats to be perimenopausal or menopausal. It just might be easier to identify menopause if you are. \nNo one actually agrees how many symptoms of menopause there are. Some places say 34, some places say 40, whilst others it’s even more than that. The most commonly referred to symptoms tend to be:\n\nHot flushes\nNight sweats\nPeriod changes\nMood changes (including anxiety, low mood)\nChanges to sleep. \n\n \nIn general, people will split symptoms up into 4 types of symptom:\n\nVasomotor symptoms. These are a specific type of symptom which are caused when your blood vessels contract or expand, in response to temperature changes. Vasomotor symptoms include hot flushes, night sweats, and heart palpitations. \nPhysical symptoms. These are symptoms which impact your body. Examples of physical symptoms include joint pain, headaches and thinning hair. \nPsychological symptoms. These are symptoms which impact your emotional wellbeing and how you feel. This might include brain fog, memory changes, mood changes and confidence issues. \nUrogenital. These are symptoms which impact your vagina, vulva and the surrounding area, including the bladder and pelvic floor. Examples of these symptoms include vaginal dryness and painful sex. \n\nAs you can see… it’s a whole mind and body experience. \nBut there are many other symptoms of menopause…\nSome symptoms are barely mentioned compared to hot flushes and mood changes. This can make it scary if you start to experience symptoms you’ve never heard of – you might not even think of menopause with some of these. Some common, but less well known, symptoms of menopause are:\n\nMemory changes. It can be scary if you start to forget things, but don’t worry many women will experience this during peri/menopause. It’s usually temporary. \nYour heart beating quickly and strongly. This can feel like a heart attack. But actually this can be a vasomotor symptom that’s associated with menopause. \nChanges to taste and smell. Many women will experience this whilst pregnant, when hormones are changing too. Changes to taste and smell can also happen during perimenopause. \nNot wanting to have sex. This can be a really impactful symptom for women, which impacts relationships and confidence levels. It’s sometimes called having ‘low libido’. This is a very common symptom. \n\n \nIf you’d like to know more about some of the early symptoms of menopause, you can do that here. If you’re struggling with a wide range of symptoms it’s always best to talk to a healthcare professional. We’ve got a handy guide of how to prepare for your first perimenopause appointment with a doctor, and our symptom tracker below can support you with this.. \nThe full list of 34 symptoms… or wait is it 40?\nAs we say, no one really agrees on exactly how many menopause symptoms there are. More research is being done all the time, which is great, but leads to an ever changing picture of menopause symptoms. We’ve done our best to summarise the 34 most commonly cited symptoms of menopause here:\n\nHot flushes\nNight sweats\nAnxiety\nBrain fog\nPeriod changes\nHeart palpitations or your heart beating suddenly and quickly\nMood swings\nDepression or low mood\nAnxiety\nTearfulness\nBrain fog or memory changes\nIrritability or being short tempered\nPanic attacks\nWeight gain\nLack of confidence\nLow motivation\nChanges to your digestion\nVaginal dryness\nItchy skin\nLow libido \nPainful sex\nBurning or tingling sensations on the skin\nJoint pain\nThinning hair\nDifficulty concentrating\nFeeling tired all the time\nSleep issues \nDry eyes\nBladder issues or urinary incontinence\nRecurrent UTIs\nThinning nails\nBody odour changes\nChanges to taste and smell\nFeeling tired all the time\n\n \nHow to keep track of what’s going on with you\nWhen there’s a lot going on in life (managing work, kids, ageing parents etc) it can be hard to keep track of how you’re feeling, and symptoms you may be experiencing. Tracking your symptoms over time can be a helpful way to understand what’s going on with you – mentally and physically. \nThere are lots of different ways you can track including using an app or with notes on your phone or even just old fashioned pen and paper. Our community at the Lowdown like a low-tech way – printing out a simple symptom tracker, sticking it on the fridge, and completing it when you remember. It doesn’t need to be every day. But weekly, keeping track of how things are changing can be useful to allow you to see if things are getting worse over time. Download here. \nTracking can be useful before speaking to your GP about menopause\nSpeaking to a GP about perimenopause for the first time can be nerve wracking. Having a written record of your symptoms, over a number of days or weeks, can help communicate exactly what is going on. It’s always helpful to be able to give your GP:\n\nA summary of most severe or frequent symptoms\nHow these are changing over time (are they getting worse)\nHow long you think they’ve been going on for.\n\nHaving these written in a symptom tracking document before the appointment means that you can get straight to the point with the doctor, and use the rest of the 10 minute appointment to talk about different treatment options. Your GP is likely to ask you a few questions, just to clarify what you’re going through. Then they can then talk you through options for treatment. If you’d like to know more about what to expect from your first GP appointment – you can do that here. \n\n\n\n",

        "Title": "How to manage sleep problems in perimenopause",
        "Content": "\nIntro\nStruggling to drift off, waking up at odd hours, or feeling like your sleep isn’t as refreshing as it used to be…\nWhatever your night looks like, know that perimenopause often comes with disrupted sleep. This phase of life can already feel like a rollercoaster because of all the physical, emotional and psychological changes. Add sleep disruptions into the mix and it can feel extra challenging.\nBut don’t worry; understanding why this happens and how to tackle it can make a world of difference! Let’s explore a few strategies and natural remedies to recover the restful sleep you deserve.\nPerimenopause: why do you have trouble sleeping?\nSleep issues are very common during perimenopause. Studies indicate that up to 50% of women experience some form of sleep disruption during this time [1]. This can range from difficulty falling asleep to frequent awakenings or being unable to get back to sleep.\nThe reasons behind this are multifaceted, with hot flushes and night sweats (also called ‘vasomotor symptoms’) partly explaining it [2]. Of course, if your pj’s get damp and you find yourself shivering, it will impact your sleep and may even lead to insomnia [3]. Although hot flushes & night sweats are not the only cause, many people report better sleep once these symptoms improve.\nHot flushes and night sweats are a whole chapter in itself, but you can start tackling it by keeping your room temperature below 19°C. You can also talk to your doctor and explore the hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) route, as many people report sleep improvement after starting it [4]. This is also what some of our community members have been saying. You shouldn’t refrain from seeking medical attention and medication (if relevant to you) as sleep is essential to overall well-being.\nThe fluctuating hormones during perimenopause, particularly oestrogen and progesterone, are crucial for sleep quality1. Oestrogens play a role in the production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that helps regulate sleep-wake cycles.\nProgesterone is known for its calming effect and is linked to deep sleep [5]; so having less of it or having the levels rise and fall in an unpredictable way could explain restless nights.\nKnowing that perimenopause can last up to 12 years, does that mean you’ll have to deal with poor sleep for this long or the rest of your life? Absolutely not.\nYes, sleep problems can continue throughout this period and into post-menopause sometimes. However, for many women, these issues gradually improve after menopause. Considering the perimenopause window alone, there are a few things you can try, both medical and non-medical.\nWhat you can do to improve your sleep during perimenopause\n\nRoom temperature: Besides maintaining a room temperature below 19°C, make sure your bedroom is dark and quiet to create an optimal sleep environment. Investing in a good mattress and pillows can also make a big difference. Wear loose fitting, cotton pyjamas that breathe.\nSleep hygiene: Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. Create a relaxing bedtime routine, such as reading a book, deep breathing, or meditating, and put your screens away to avoid doom scrolling and the blue light that keeps you awake. These healthier habits help signal to your body that it’s time to wind down and prepare for sleep.\nExercise and enough daylight: Exposing yourself to sunlight helps your daily biological clock (circadian rhythm) and physical activity also helps you feel more relaxed. Your body needs to run on a well-oiled inner clock in order to know when to go to sleep and when to wake up [6].\nFood can overstimulate: Avoid consuming large meals, caffeine, or alcohol close to bedtime, as these keep your body too busy (through digestion). Caffeine and alcohol, in particular, can interfere with your ability to fall asleep and stay asleep, leading to more frequent awakenings during the night.\n\n\nCan HRT help with sleep issues?\nHormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) works by supplementing the body with oestrogen and progesterone, helping to stabilise hormone levels. This can alleviate night sweats and improve sleep quality. Depending on the type of HRT you choose, some regimens may also help directly with sleep, for example Utrogestan is known to make you drowsy! However, HRT isn’t the go-to answer for everyone and should be discussed with your doctor to weigh the benefits and risks.\nNatural remedies for sleep struggles\n\nHerbal supplements: Some people find relief with herbal supplements like valerian root, chamomile, or passionflower, all known for their calming effects [7,8].\nBe aware: Black cohosh or phytoestrogens are presented as reducing hot flushes and promoting sleep quality. Research on these is limited or sometimes conflicting and they aren’t suitable for everyone to use [10].\n\nWhat about sleeping pills for perimenopause?\nIf you get over-the-counter sleeping aids, they may contain melatonin, a synthesised form of a hormone, naturally present in the body.\nMelatonin prepares the body for rest, regulates the sleep cycle, and improves mood. Like many other hormones, it can be impacted by perimenopause changes. However, supplementing with melatonin has been studied and shown to help with sleep issues. It’s important to be cautious about the dosage and how long you’re taking it as these two aspects are inconsistent in the studies [11]; bring up the topic when you see your doctor next time.\nOther sleeping aids available from pharmacies include anti-histamines which are used for their side effect of sedation. However, doctors don’t recommend these long term.\nPrescription medications for sleep are reserved for the most severe sleep problems. These are only prescribed by doctors for short term use as they have a potential to cause dependence and addiction – so please speak to your healthcare professional in depth about the risks before trying them.\nWhen should you speak to a doctor?\nYour body needs proper rest to function. Chronic insomnia can lead to more serious health concerns, including depression, anxiety, or cardiovascular problems. If you’ve had insomnia for several weeks or more, you should talk to your doctor. They can help determine if there is any underlying cause of your sleep issues.\nThey might recommend personalised treatments like HRT or cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), which is a technique designed to modify behaviours by changing underlying thought patterns.\nIf your sleep difficulties continue despite trying lifestyle changes and natural remedies, you should also seek medical advice. If you’re uncertain where to start you can reach out to our partners and menopause experts at Myla health.\n\n\n",

        "Title": "Menopause and exercise",
        "Content": "\nWhat’s the Best Exercise for Menopause? \nMenopause can bring a surprising number of symptoms (more than 34!), which vary widely from one individual to another. Whether you’re experiencing night sweats, hot flushes, difficulty sleeping, joint or muscle pain, you might wonder if exercise could help you manage some of these symptoms. \nThe good news is, yes, it can!\n\nHow exercise can help with menopause changes\nRemember how relaxed you felt after that last workout? That’s the effect of endorphins being released in your body. These chemicals are partly responsible for improving sleep quality. So, increasing exercise means adding more of the feel-good ingredient, which compensates for the sleep disruptions that often come with menopause [1]. \nOn the other hand, other hormones, like oestrogens, fluctuate and eventually drop. Hormonal fluctuations is an all-natural process [2] during menopause but it also means that body parts benefiting from oestrogens might not perform as well or may even ache. This is commonly the case for muscles or joints [3]. \nOestrogens play a role that goes beyond reproduction. They help protect the heart by keeping blood vessels flexible and promoting healthy cholesterol levels. They also reduce inflammation, which supports good bone density and reduces the joint pain and stiffness often experienced during perimenopause.\nIt may sound counterintuitive, but staying active helps with sore or weak muscles. Engaging muscles, in turn, helps with joints that are tightly connected to them and tend to absorb whatever malfunctions in the muscles [4]. To tackle this specifically, you can look into low-impact activities such as swimming or yoga [5]. \nPhysical activity is not only a great way to cope with daily life, it also keeps stress, anxiety and depressive episodes at bay [6]. In fact, promising reports, based on women’s experiences, highlight how overall health and mental well-being are greatly improved thanks to physical activity [7]. This is also what our community members going through perimenopause are saying about exercise\nAs to whether exercise alone can be an effective treatment for night sweats and hot flushes, studies are rather slim in this area. [7]. Physical activity cannot be presented as THE solution for vasomotor symptoms. It is best to include exercise within the constellation of lifestyle changes. \nThat’s why we suggest approaching menopause in a holistic way. Perhaps what will work for you is a combination of exercise together with medication, such as Hormonal Replacement Therapy, diet changes, finding your community, and a team of doctors well-versed in women’s health. The combination is very personal and we encourage you to talk to your doctors to explore different avenues.\nExercise for menopause belly \nThe years leading to menopause come with the greatest changes in terms of body composition: Fat tends to settle around the abdomen, waistline, and lower back. More fat accumulates between the organs and deeper tissues, also known as “visceral fat” [8,9]. All of this middle weight gain is what people commonly call the “menopause belly”. \nFor this, you can look into core training exercises using your own bodyweight (for example, planks and side twists) or Pilates, a form of training recognised for strengthening core deep muscles and improving lower back pain. [10]. \nWhile ab workouts can improve your posture and muscle tone, they won’t magically make all the fat disappear from this specific area. So, don’t get too obsessed about crunches. Instead, focus on the bigger picture and think about maintaining a healthy weight overall. This is what will really help with that menopause belly in the long run. \nCan exercise impact other symptoms? \nExercising presents other health benefits in the long run: \n\nCounteracting some of the negative effects menopause can have on the heart and nervous system. It reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases or dementia appearing late in life and predominantly affecting women [11, 12]. \nMaintaining healthy bones. We don’t often think about them, but our bones age with us, and we lose precious minerals even rapidly during menopause [13]. The type of exercise particularly recommended includes weight-lifting as it retains and even increases bone density. \nSupporting pelvic health. We tend to overlook our pelvic floor, but over time, the pelvic muscles lose their elasticity and they struggle to fulfill their primary function of holding inner organs in place [14]. Add in things like childbearing or childbirth, and by menopause, the pelvic floor muscles can get relatively weak. This can lead to problems like leaking urine or prolapse. Learning how to do pelvic floor exercises is a great way to improve this, by contracting and relaxing your muscles slowly then quickly. You could do that while at your desk or waiting for the bus; yes, physical activity can be as subtle as that!\n\n \nWhat are the best exercises for menopause? \nYour “menopause-friendly” fitness routine should mix strength training, activities that increase heart rate (aerobic) [15] and mobility [16]. Aim for the equivalent of 30 minutes per day, five times a week (a total of 150 minutes per week). How you split these weekly 150 minutes among strength training, aerobic, and mobility is totally up to you! \nHere are a few examples of aerobic activities: HIIT training, running, biking uphill, swimming, and dancing. Strength training includes lifting weights but can also involve using your body weight (think squats or pushups). For mobility, you can add in a yoga routine, for example.\nIt’s never too late to get back on track! In fact, the years around menopause constitute a great window to shift things around because of the rate at which changes accelerate.\nRemember to eat plenty of nutrient-dense food and get proper rest between your sessions. Starting something new isn’t always easy, but the best regular exercise is the one you can stick to, whatever that looks like for you. That could be going for a walk around the block or getting up the stairs. \nAny exercise to avoid? \nBe mindful and listen to your body. If something feels too challenging, consider gradually increasing the duration or repetition or finding an alternative altogether.  \nIf you feel like your joints are hurting, then high-impact exercises like running or jumping might make things worse and lead to injuries. Instead, switch to low-impact cardio activities like walking, swimming, and cycling. These are gentler on the joints and still give you great cardiovascular benefits. \nWhile strength training is great for the bones, if you’ve been diagnosed with osteoporosis, it is recommended to avoid backbends and twisting the spine [17], so be careful when lifting heavy weights. Speaking of weight lifting, these exercises can put pressure on your pelvic floor muscles. It’s a good idea to talk to your doctor or physiotherapist, as lifting can weaken these muscles if done excessively or in the wrong way.\nBetween the do’s and don’ts, it can quickly become overwhelming. You don’t have to do it on your own and if you have any questions, come talk to our partners at Myla.\n\n\n",

        "Title": "Racial disparities faced by Black women seeking endometriosis diagnosis",
        "Content": "\nWhat’s the deal with endometriosis anyway?\nEndometriosis is a condition that can affect the whole body. It’s a chronic inflammatory condition and affects about one in ten people who were assigned female at birth [2]. The symptoms range from severe period pain or painful sex, to a change in bowel habit, brain fog and fatigue. We’ve put together a handy article to give you the lowdown on endometriosis.\nWhat’s race got to do with it?\nEndometriosis doesn’t discriminate. It can affect those of all backgrounds.\nUnfortunately, there is limited research exploring how race and ethnicity can impact the prevalence of endometriosis. Studies often overlook the intersectionality of race and gender, failing to address the unique challenges faced by black people in accessing healthcare services.\nSpecifically, research currently suggests that black women may be less likely to receive an endometriosis diagnosis compared to white women. There’s limited research exploring how race and ethnicity can impact the symptoms experienced by people with endometriosis, as well as their access to treatment, their treatment preferences, and their responses to treatment [1]. \nThere is a concerning disparity in healthcare access and outcomes for black women with endometriosis. On average, people with the condition wait between 8 to 12 years to be diagnosed, but for black women, this wait time is even longer [2]. Research has shown that black women were 50% less likely to receive a diagnosis than their white counterparts [3].\nWhy? Well, there are a few factors at play…\nThese delays are influenced by various factors, including difficulties in accessing gynae care and also systematic racism within the medical system. This means that black women may endure prolonged pain without receiving the proper diagnosis and treatment they need.\nWhile awareness of endometriosis in black women has increased, research specifically focusing on black women’s experiences remains limited.\nWhat are the systemic inequalities and barriers that black women face when seeking a diagnosis for a medical condition?\nHealthcare bias\nEveryone deserves equal access to accurate diagnosis and compassionate treatment. Unfortunately, systemic inequalities and barriers can often stand in the way, especially for black women who are facing medical conditions like endometriosis.\nImplicit biases among healthcare providers can lead to disparities in the diagnosis of endometriosis. Black women can often face scepticism and dismissal of their symptoms, delaying proper care. For example, J Marion Sims, a 19th-century American doctor known for inventing the speculum conducted experimental surgeries on enslaved women without their consent and without pain relief [4].\nSims justified his decision by wrongly believing that black people had higher pain tolerance [5]. Unfortunately, this racist misconception still affects healthcare today. A survey in the UK found that many black people have encountered prejudice from healthcare professionals, including situations where their pain was dismissed, underplayed or ignored [6].\nCultural stigma & silence\nIt’s key to recognise the impact of cultural beliefs and stigmas on reproductive health, particularly for black women dealing with endometriosis symptoms. These taboos may lead to hesitation in seeking medical assistance, delaying diagnosis and treatment. Additionally, misconceptions and a lack of awareness only solidify the issue, making it harder for black women to get the help they need.\nWhat can I do?\nIf you have any symptoms of endometriosis, (covered in our blog post on what endometriosis feels like), take a look at some of our tips below. It’s not all doom and gloom!\nSelf-advocacy\nTrust your instincts and advocate for yourself during medical appointments. Clearly communicate your symptoms and concerns to healthcare providers using our blog on how to speak to your doctor. Remember you’re your own best advocate and your input is so important in making sure you receive the care you deserve. If you struggle with this at medical appointments, you can always bring someone along with you.\nSeek support\nConnect with online communities and support groups for black women with endometriosis. Sharing experiences and resources can provide valuable support and guidance. You can share your experiences of endometriosis on The Lowdown. We offer a safe space for sharing experiences, finding solidarity with people in a similar situation to you and accessing information and resources that may help you.\nEducate yourself\nStay informed about endometriosis and its symptoms. Knowledge empowers you to ask the right questions and make informed decisions about your health. Take advantage of the blog posts on The Lowdown which can help you to deepen your understanding of endometriosis and how it can affect you. By staying informed, you can actively participate in your healthcare journey and work with your team to find solutions to help you manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life.\nYour health and well-being deserve attention and care, and taking proactive steps can make a positive difference in your journey toward diagnosis and treatment. Endometriosis doesn’t discriminate, but unfortunately the healthcare system can. \nThere is good news. Campaigns like the 5xMore campaign are driving significant changes in healthcare, and there are other initiatives like the Reproductive Justice Initiative who aim to create a more inclusive and supportive healthcare environment for all.\nTo black women who are navigating their journey with endometriosis, know that you’re not alone. Your voice matters, and your health deserves to be prioritised. At The Lowdown, we strive for a system that truly serves and supports every individual, regardless of the colour of their skin.\n\n\n",

You’re not alone.\nAre you ready to share stories, tips and tactics for tackling endometriosis fatigue? The Lowdowns got your back. We have a trove of real-life experiences shared by fellow endometriosis warriors who know the struggle first-hand. Why not also let your voice be heard? Your story could be just the inspiration someone else needs to keep pushing.\nWhat is endometriosis related fatigue? And why does endometriosis cause fatigue?\nSo, why can endometriosis be so exhausting? \nEndometriosis-related fatigue is a result of several factors which include:\n\nChronic pain: Being in constant pain can drain your energy, leaving you feeling exhausted\nInflammation: Endometriosis causes inflammation in the body, which can lead to fatigue\nHormonal imbalances: Hormonal fluctuations linked with endometriosis can disrupt your sleep and energy levels\n\nThink of it as your body’s way of waving a red flag in response to the endometrial-like tissue being outside the uterus – where it isn’t supposed to be! Chronic pain, hormonal imbalances and inflammation – these tag-team to hijack your energy levels and leave you feeling like you’re running on empty.\nSome studies have shown that it isn’t only the endometriosis itself, but the pelvic pain and sleep disturbances that can have an effect on your quality of life and cause fatigue [1]. Endometriosis is a chronic, inflammatory full body condition and while we don’t fully understand why it causes fatigue yet, it’s clear that it can have a huge impact on your entire body.\nA small study of 22 women with endometriosis who were dealing with moderate to severe pain reported that 100% of those interviewed also experienced fatigue [2]. This fatigue didn’t just affect one aspect of their lives, it had a big impact on their daily routines, emotions, social life, relationships, work or school and even physical activities. Knowing this, it’s clear how significant fatigue is for women with endometriosis.\nHow do you know if endometriosis fatigue has set up camp in your life? Look out for signs like feeling persistently exhausted, struggling to focus, and wrestling with a general sense of lethargy. If these symptoms sound all too familiar, it might be time to take action.\nWhen it feels like fatigue is calling the shots in your life, it’s essential to reach out for support. Whether it’s talking to your doctor or seeking solace in online communities like The Lowdown, don’t hesitate to ask for a helping hand. Remember, you’re not alone in this battle.\nWhat does endometriosis-related fatigue actually feel like?\nEndometriosis fatigue often goes beyond normal tiredness. It often includes:\n\nExtreme exhaustion: feeling overwhelmingly tired even after a full night’s sleep\nMental fog: Difficulty concentrating or remembering things\nPhysical weakness: A feeling of heaviness or weakness in the muscles \n\nFor many people, this fatigue can be difficult to deal with. It can affect your ability to work, socialise and in some cases, perform daily activities.\nHow can I help my endometriosis related fatigue?\nBanishing endometriosis fatigue isn’t about finding a quick fix – it’s about adopting a holistic approach to wellness. From prioritising quality sleep to nourishing your body with a balanced diet, every step counts on the road to reclaiming your vitality. Studies have shown that endometriosis fatigue can be managed if sleep, pain, emotional wellness and everyday stress is reduced.\nSome women with endometriosis related fatigue often have a decline in physical fitness. Specifically, when compared to women without endometriosis, you may have weaker lower back muscles, less flexibility in your spine and might struggle with balancing and functional abilities. What’s interesting is that the level of fatigue experienced by women with endometriosis seems to be linked to physical fitness. This suggests that exercise programmes tailored to the lower back muscles and spine could help with endometriosis related fatigue. [4]\nWhile no high-quality research has yet confirmed the effectiveness of specialist lifestyle interventions like diet and exercise for managing endometriosis fatigue, there’s promising potential. Supporting self-management is important to help improve your life if you’re struggling with endometriosis related fatigue. One of the simplest steps you can take would be to speak to a women’s health physio specialising in endometriosis, or speaking to a dietitian or nutritionist. (Or choose our physio Kathryn who can do it all!)\nHow is endometriosis related fatigue different from just feeling tired?\nUnlike regular tiredness that can be helped by rest, endometriosis fatigue is usually persistent and often doesn’t improve with sleep. As it can affect both the body and the mind, it can be challenging to carry out even simple tasks.\nDoes endometriosis related fatigue go away after surgery?\nSurgery to remove endometrial tissue can sometimes provide significant relief for some people, however, the fatigue might persist even after surgery. This might be due to the body’s prolonged inflammatory response and other underlying factors. This is why it’s important to focus on all aspects of your health for your endo recovery, rather than surgery alone.\nWhat has the community got to say?\nReady to swap tips, tricks and tactics for tackling endometriosis-related fatigue?

        "Title": "Endometriosis pain relief: what are my options?",
        "Content": "\nSo, you’ve heard about endometriosis and those pains it brings along? Let’s dive into the world of endometriosis pain relief – because nobody should have to grin and bear it.\nWhat causes my endometriosis pain?\nHave you ever felt like your body’s staging a protest every month? If you have endometriosis, this is a reality that many people face. This condition throws endometrial-like tissue to places where it shouldn’t be, causing inflammation and, you guessed it, pain. From annoying dull aches to sharp stabs, endometriosis pain is no joke. But we’re here to help you understand this pain and find ways to relieve it.\nEndometriosis is a chronic condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus [1]. During menstruation, this tissue behaves similarly to the uterine lining, breaking down and bleeding as it responds to hormonal changes. However, unlike the lining of the uterus, this blood and tissue have no way to exit the body, causing inflammation, pain, and the formation of scar tissue. This can lead to a variety of symptoms, including pelvic pain, painful periods, pain during intercourse, and infertility. \nUnderstanding the source of endometriosis pain is crucial for dealing with and managing this pain. While the exact cause of endometriosis pain is not fully understood, it is thought to be primarily due to inflammation caused by the presence of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus [2]. This inflammation can irritate surrounding tissues and nerves, leading to pain which is felt in many different ways.\nFor some people, common triggers of endometriosis pain include:\n\nHormonal changes, especially around menstruation\nCertain foods, like foods high in sugar or caffeine\nFeeling stressed \nLack of sleep \nPhysical exertion\n\nHow can I help my pain?\nImmediate and long-term relief can help with endometriosis pain. \nImmediate relief includes:\n\nPain relief: Over-the-counter options like ibuprofen and paracetamol or prescribed medication to provide temporary relief\nHeat therapy: Heating pads or warm baths can help to soothe muscle cramps and pain\nTENS machines like the Myoovi.\n\nLong-term relief includes: \n\nHormonal treatments that can help to manage pain by regulating or stopping menstruation \nLifestyle changes like regular exercise, a balanced diet and stress management techniques like yoga or meditation\nSurgical treatments\n\nSo, what’s in your pain relief toolkit? From over-the-counter medication to prescription powerhouses, there are many options to explore. No one should have to live in constant pain. When it comes to pain relief, it’s all about finding what floats your boat and what is suitable for you and your lifestyle.\nOver-the-counter pain relief such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen or mefenamic acid can be effective in reducing endometriosis pain. These work by reducing inflammation which can help to relieve discomfort. If you do take any NSAIDs, make sure to take them with a meal, snack or a drink of milk. This can make them less likely to upset your stomach. \nIf these don’t work, make sure to speak to your doctor. They might prescribe stronger pain medications or hormonal therapies to help manage symptoms. Hormonal therapies are a whole other area to explore which are a mainstay of treatment for endo pain so be sure to check out our blog.\nNon-pharmacological approaches can also play a huge role in helping to manage endometriosis pain. Heat therapy, such as using a heating pad or warm bath, can help relax your muscles and reduce any cramping you might have. Additionally, techniques such as acupuncture, yoga, and meditation may help reduce stress and improve overall well-being, which can in turn help manage pain [4].\nLet’s chat about TENS machines (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator) – an alternative to traditional pain relief. They work by attaching to the skin via electrodes and sending electrical impulses into the body. These impulses don’t hurt, instead they feel ticklish. So, how do they work their magic? Well, scientists still aren’t completely sure but think they either work by blocking pain messages as they travel through your nerves, or they help your body to produce their own natural pain relief called endorphins.\nAnd here’s the cherry on top – some TENS machines like the Myoovi are so handy; you can just stick them to your skin. We’ve put together a handy guide of Myoovi reviews so you can see if it’ll work for you. And finally there is the magic of the pelvic health physiotherapist who can be absolutely game changing for endo pain, and unfortunately not many people know about them!\nThankfully, this reviewer found one and recommends them to everyone…\n“One of my best pieces of advice would be to see a pelvic floor physio.”\nDoes endometriosis pain ever go away?\nFor some people, endometriosis pain may lessen with age or after the menopause. However, many people need ongoing management to cope with the symptoms. Endometriosis management aims to help you reduce pain and improve quality of life, rather than curing it.\nWhen should I speak to a doctor?\nWhen your body starts sending out those SOS signals, it’s time to speak to your doctor. Whether the pain’s throwing a full-blown party or new symptoms decide to gatecrash, don’t hesitate to reach out. Your doctor has the expertise to guide you through the maze of treatment options and get you back to feeling like yourself again. Sometimes it can be daunting to speak to them, but you can use our handy guide here. You can book an appointment with one of our women’s health doctors to help you get to the bottom of a problem or help you to put a pain management plan into action. After all, everyone deserves to be listened to!\nWhile the occasional pelvic pain can be common and may not necessarily mean there’s something serious happening, if you have persistent or severe pain that isn’t settling with paracetamol and ibuprofen or is stopping you from doing your day to day tasks, this shouldn’t be ignored.\nIf you have symptoms like severe pelvic pain, pain during intercourse, heavy or irregular periods, or difficulty getting pregnant, it’s so important to seek medical advice. Your doctor can help you manage your symptoms and if needed, help to develop an appropriate treatment plan.\nAre there any exciting developments on the horizon for endometriosis?\nResearch into endometriosis is ongoing, with new treatments and management strategies continually being explored. Recent studies suggest that genetic factors can play a role in the condition, which can pave the way for potential new therapies. [5]\nWhat have the community got to say?\nReady to swap stories and tips with fellow endo warriors? You’re at the right place. Look no further than The Lowdown. \nPeople have shared experiences like: \n“Hot water bottles were really good. Didn’t take the pain away but the heat helped my body to loosen up a bit”\nYou can dive into real-life experiences shared by people who’ve been there, done that, and lived with endometriosis. Why not share your own journey? Your story could be just the lifeline someone else needs.\nThe Lowdown provides a platform for individuals to share their experiences with endometriosis, including their struggles, triumphs, and tips for managing symptoms including endometriosis pain. By sharing your own experiences and learning from others, you can gain valuable insight, support and become a community with other people who know and understand what you’re going through.\nWhether you’re looking for advice on managing pain, coping with emotional challenges, or navigating treatment options, The Lowdown’s endometriosis community is here to offer support and solidarity. Join the conversation, share your story, and connect with others who are on this journey with you.\nLiving with endometriosis pain isn’t always a walk in the park, but armed with the right tools and support, you can conquer those tough days and enjoy your life. Having endometriosis doesn’t mean you can’t live well! Keep learning, keep connecting, and remember, you’re never alone on this journey.\n\n\n\n",

        "Title": "Cerelle and the Menopause: Can the Pill Help?",
        "Content": "\nCerelle and the menopause: your questions answered\nThe menopause is the moment when your periods have stopped for at least the last 12 months. Before this day, you are perimenopausal, then after the menopause, you become postmenopausal. The time it takes to transition from perimenopause to postmenopause can take on average 4 years, but this may vary from a few months in some women to a decade for others. The average age to reach menopause in the UK is 51.\nThis time of your life can cause a wide range of new feelings including physical, psychological and emotional symptoms which vary in their severity and how they can affect you. The perimenopause and menopause may sound daunting, but thankfully awareness has been increasing over recent years and now it is much easier to find information and support.\n\nCan you take Cerelle during the menopause?\nYou can take the Cerelle pill during the menopause. Cerelle is a progestogen-only pill which is used as a contraceptive and can also be used as a treatment for women’s health problems including heavy or painful periods. It is safe to take for the majority of people. Cerelle can be used at all stages of the menopause and is often continued until the age of 55, when it is assumed that contraception is no longer needed. You can order the pill online through The Lowdown until the age of 55.\nHow will I know if I’ve reached menopause whilst taking Cerelle?\nTo know if you have reached menopause whilst taking Cerelle, you will need to be aware of any new symptoms or changes in your body. You can still go through menopause on the pill. However, it may be more difficult to notice as some people do not have periods or have irregular bleeding while using the pill, masking some typical features of perimenopause.\nEven while using Cerelle, you may experience perimenopausal symptoms such as hot flushes, changes in sleep, libido or mood, palpitations or anxiety. If you feel that these symptoms are new or different for you, speak to a healthcare professional. Healthcare professionals can often diagnose perimenopause based on your symptoms alone. \nHowever, if you are over the age of 50 and on Cerelle, a blood test called FSH may be taken to help decide when you can stop contraception before the age of 55. [1]\nFSH is a hormone which is important in the menstrual cycle. It will become raised after the menopause but can fluctuate up and down during the perimenopause, meaning it can be inaccurate until your periods have definitely stopped. For this reason, FSH blood tests are only used to help decide when you can stop contraception if you are over 50 and do not have periods on Cerelle. If the FSH level is raised, Cerelle should initially be continued but then can be stopped after 1 year. Otherwise Cerelle should be continued and the FSH level checked again 1 year later. [1] \n\nCan I take Cerelle with HRT?\nYou can take Cerelle with HRT (hormone replacement therapy). HRT does not provide contraception unless you use the Mirena, Levosert or Benilexa hormonal coils as part of the HRT. [2] You can still fall pregnant during the perimenopause, so it is important to use birth control until the age of 55 or, if you are not on hormonal contraception, until your periods have stopped for at least 12 months if you are over 50, or for 2 years if you are under 50. [1] Cerelle can be prescribed alongside HRT as your contraceptive.\nOccasionally, some menopause specialists will suggest 2 Cerelle tablets daily as part of HRT, however, this is an off licence treatment and not routinely prescribed.\nWhen shouldn’t you take Cerelle?\nYou shouldn’t take Cerelle if you have breast cancer or have had breast cancer in the past. If you carry the BRCA gene, the benefits of taking Cerelle generally outweigh any small risks of breast cancer and you can currently take it.[3]\nYou shouldn’t take Cerelle if you have liver conditions including severe cirrhosis, a hepatocellular adenoma (a type of benign liver tumour) or cancer of the liver. [3]\nYou should also stop taking Cerelle if you develop angina, have a heart attack or have a stroke or mini stroke while using it. [3]\nIf you have any of these conditions or are concerned about the safety of Cerelle for you, speak to your healthcare professional or book in with our fabulous doctors who provide individual women’s health advice.\nDoes Cerelle help with menopause symptoms?\nCerelle can help with some perimenopausal symptoms, but most of the symptoms of perimenopause are improved by replacing oestrogen which is not found within Cerelle or other progestogen-only pills.\nHeavy Bleeding\nHeavy bleeding is a common symptom of perimenopause. Cerelle can help with this. A benefit of Cerelle and other mini pills is thinning of the womb lining which means periods can often become lighter. \nIrregular Bleeding\nIrregular bleeding is a hallmark feature of the perimenopause. For some women, Cerelle can cause bleeds to become more irregular, however, for many other women periods can completely stop, which can be very welcome!\nCan the progestogen-only pill be used for HRT?\nThe progestogen-only pill may be used for HRT by some individuals, but only when recommended by menopause specialists who have expertise in doing so. The progestogen-only pill is not licensed to be used as HRT. This means the original clinical research did not test if it was safe or effective as part of HRT. However, some menopause specialists may prescribe a double dose of a progestogen-only pill such as Cerelle or even a triple dose of a different progestogen-only pill such as Noriday or Micronor. This is very specialised and should not be tried unless under an experienced menopause doctor.\nSome women may even find that their perimenopausal symptoms improve while taking a progestogen-only pill without using HRT. This just demonstrates how different we all are as individuals, and trying Cerelle for your symptoms is unlikely to do any harm.\nDo you still produce oestrogen on the mini pill?\nYes, you still produce oestrogen on the mini pill. \nDoes the mini pill reduce estrogen?\nThe mini pill, such as Cerelle, works by stopping ovulation (release of an egg). This can cause a small reduction in the amount of oestrogen circulating in your bloodstream throughout your cycle, however, in most women this does not cause significant symptoms.\nSummary\nThe perimenopause and menopause can be a tricky time of a woman’s life. Progestogen-only pills like Cerelle can be used safely throughout menopause for contraception and their benefits in treating period symptoms associated with perimenopause. Cerelle is safe and easy to start and stop.\nIf you have any worries or questions about the menopause, symptoms and contraception, The Lowdown’s women’s health doctors can help.\n\n\n\n",

Here’s everything you need to know about removing your IUD, the risks of removing it at home, where to get it removed, how long it takes, and what to expect afterwards.\nWhat is an IUD?\nAn intrauterine device (IUD) is a form of long-acting reversible contraception that is inserted into the uterus. There are two types of IUDs: hormonal and non-hormonal. Hormonal IUDs release progestin, which thickens cervical mucus, thins the lining of the womb and in some cases prevents ovulation. Non-hormonal IUDs are wrapped in copper, which is toxic to sperm.\n\nCan I remove my IUD at home?\nWe don’t recommend that you attempt to remove your IUD at home. The process of removing an IUD requires medical expertise and special equipment, and attempting to remove it yourself can cause serious harm to your reproductive system.\nWhat are the risks of removing my IUD at home?\nFirstly, you may not be able to even find your threads, as sometimes they wrap themselves around the cervix, or tuck themselves back up inside the cervix and need a healthcare professional to fish them out using a specially designed stick. \nOne of the main concerns is bleeding, especially if the IUD is difficult to remove or not removed properly. Removal can rarely cause injury to the uterus or cervix. This can lead to severe pain, bleeding, and even the need for surgery. \nAnother risk of self-removal is incomplete removal where part of the coil breaks off or is left behind, or the coil becomes stuck. Lastly, attempting to remove an IUD at home can cause a lot of pain and discomfort. This can be due to the position of the IUD or the inability to see or grasp the strings properly. A healthcare provider is trained to remove the IUD efficiently and with minimal discomfort (1).\nWhere can I get my IUD removed?\nIn the UK, you can have your IUD removed at a sexual health clinic, a family planning clinic, GP surgery or at some young people’s services. These healthcare providers are trained in the safe and effective removal of IUDs and can provide you with advice and support before, during, and after the procedure. Find a sexual health clinic here.\nHow long does it take to remove an IUD?\nThe removal process for an IUD is usually quick and simple, it often only takes a couple of minutes in total. The practitioner will use a speculum to hold your vagina open and locate the strings attached to the IUD. They will then gently pull on the strings to remove the IUD from your uterus, often while asking you to cough. Some women may experience discomfort or cramping, but it is generally not considered to be a painful procedure. If the strings are not visible and cannot be located by the clinician, you may need an ultrasound scan and to be referred to a clinic where they are trained to retrieve the threads from the cervical canal.\nHow can I prepare for IUD removal?\nYou don’t need to do anything special to prepare for IUD removal. However, it’s a good idea to let your healthcare provider know if you are taking any medications, have any medical conditions, or are allergic to any medications. \nIf you are planning an IUD removal to switch contraceptives, planning can be really important. Here’s what our fabulous Dr. Fran says:\n“For a copper IUD, within the first 5 days of your period is an ideal time to start a new method and have the coil removed as you will be protected from pregnancy straight away.\nHowever, If you are outside the first 5 days of your cycle with a copper IUD or have a hormonal IUD, ideally you should avoid sex or use condoms for the 7 days before your planned removal date. This makes switching easier and prevents unplanned pregnancy in the crossover. If you have had sex without a condom, delay the removal by another 7 days after starting your new method (which is safe to do!).\nThe switching rules can be complicated so it’s best to check out our switching blog or speak to your healthcare professional.”\nIf you’re wondering which method you should switch to, check out our contraception recommender tool to find the best option for you and your lifestyle.\nWill I experience side effects after the IUD removal?\nYou might experience some mild cramping or spotting for a few days after the removal, but most women don’t experience any major side effects (3). After a few days, these symptoms should stop, if you have some concerns or unusual symptoms, you should contact your GP.\nCan I get my IUD removed on my period?\nYes, you can have your IUD removed during your period, that’s completely fine and healthcare professionals genuinely don’t care if you’re bleeding or not! \n\n\n\n",

        "Title": "Am I perimenopausal? Managing uncertainty in your 30s",
        "Content": "\n\nWhat are some of the most common symptoms of perimenopause?\nPerimenopause is a unique journey for each person, so symptoms and their intensity vary between individuals. Some are lucky to experience just one or two mild symptoms, whereas others will navigate a full spectrum of challenges. \nFor a full overview, read everything you need to know about perimenopause by Dr Fran. \nThe earliest sign of perimenopause is often irregular, skipped or stopped periods. If you’ve always had a regular menstrual cycle and begin noticing changes in your 30s, this could signal that your hormones are changing.  \nOther common symptoms of perimenopause include:\n\nHot flushes\nNight sweats\nVaginal atrophy\nSleep disturbances \nLow mood or anxiety\nLow sex drive \nBrain fog\nWorsening of PMS\n\n\nAm I too young to be perimenopausal? \nNo, you’re not too young to be perimenopausal, but it’s important to get the diagnosis right! \nMany people express concern and confusion about being too young to be perimenopausal. It’s a topic shrouded in uncertainty, so let’s set the record straight: \n\nTypical menopause occurs on average between the ages of 45-55\nEarly menopause happens between the ages of 40-45 (and occurs in 7-12% of us)\nPrimary Ovarian Insufficiency (previously called premature menopause) under the age of 40 can occur in around 1-3% of us\n\nRemember: menopause is just one day, exactly 12 months after your last period. You’re perimenopausal in the time you experience symptoms up to this point and postmenopausal after this point.\nThere’s limited data to explain why some people reach menopause at a young age. However, research suggests it could be genetic: you’re more likely to experience early menopause if women in your mother’s family also did [5]. \nWhilst an earlier menopause is natural for some people, others may have symptoms triggered by another medical problem, which is why it’s important to see your doctor and explain your concerns. \nPrimary ovarian insufficiency symptoms are similar to perimenopause, so doctors will want to investigate this in younger patients as it’s important not to miss. However, doctors will also want to check you over and make sure your symptoms are not related to anything else before attributing it to perimenopause.\nWhat is primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)?\nPrimary ovarian insufficiency sounds like complicated jargon. Put simply, it means your ovaries have stopped or slowed their hormone production before the age of 40. \nPossible causes of POI include:\n\nGenetic factors or chromosomal differences: you may be born with fewer follicles (immature eggs) in your ovaries – or you may have a problem with your chromosomes that increases the risk of POI, like Turner’s syndrome or Fragile X syndrome.\nAutoimmune conditions: POI can be associated with autoimmune conditions such as thyroid disorders or diabetes. Autoimmune POI is complex but seems to be due to cells or proteins in your own body responding in the wrong way or “attacking” your eggs.\nSurgery, chemotherapy or radiation: ovaries can be removed or damaged which will slow or stop their hormone production.\nInfection: bacteria and viruses like tuberculosis or mumps can also cause damage to your ovary function.\n\nWhen should you speak to your doctor?\nWhen it comes to perimenopause, we often hear stories of women feeling dismissed by their doctor or leaving their appointment unsatisfied. Please, don’t let this deter you – if your symptoms are impacting your quality of life, it’s time to seek support. \nThe Lowdown’s resident menopause specialist, Dr Nikki, advises anyone feeling uncertain about perimenopause in their 30s to start tracking their symptoms, as well as their period dates. \n“After 3 months of tracking, book an appointment with a doctor who understands women’s health. Show the information and ask what investigations can be done to look into the symptoms.”\nBy tracking your symptoms before you see a doctor, you’ll be prepared to answer their questions and get the very most out of your appointment. \nFor more tips, check out our blog on preparing for your first perimenopause appointment.\nWhat do doctors look out for?\nDuring your appointment, your doctor will question you about your symptoms: when they began, which are the most distressing to you, and how they’re impacting your life. \nDr Nikki shares her approach: \n“When someone presents with perimenopause symptoms in their 30s, I always take this seriously. I listen and try to get to the key symptoms that are causing the most distress – and then plan what to do next with investigations and treatment.”\nDr Nikki also recommends reading books on perimenopause to gain an understanding of what’s normal and what treatment options are available. This will help you feel empowered with information during your appointment. \nFSH testing\nDoctors use FSH testing to confirm early menopause or POI because your FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) levels rise after this point [7]. During perimenopause, your FSH levels fluctuate. This means FSH testing is not a reliable way to confirm perimenopause – it’s often diagnosed based on symptoms alone. \nThere’s a slight exception here… for people under 45, doctors may conduct FSH testing to support their perimenopause diagnosis [8]. In this case, two tests taken 6 weeks apart both need to show raised FSH levels for someone to be classed as having early menopause between 40-45 years old, or POI if you’re under 40.\nCan you use HRT for perimenopause?\nHormone replacement therapy (HRT) can be used to manage perimenopause symptoms. \nHRT works by introducing oestrogen and progesterone to stabilise your natural hormone levels. Keeping oestrogen levels stable helps improve perimenopause symptoms, whilst progesterone protects your uterus from the effects of too much oestrogen. \nYour doctor will review your medical history, symptoms, and preferences to ensure you’re a good candidate for HRT. The good news is, that with regular checkups and the right support, HRT can offer a long-term solution for managing perimenopause symptoms in your 30s and beyond.\nFor an in-depth explanation, check out our blog on perimenopause and HRT. You can also compare real reviews from women who’ve tried it on our HRT review page. \nHormonal contraception such as the pill or the hormonal IUS can also be used to manage perimenopause symptoms. Similar to HRT, you’ll need to discuss your options with your doctor to find the right solution. \nWhat to do if you’re feeling dismissed or frustrated with your care?\nApproaching menopause at a young age can be scary. That’s why it’s so important you get the information and support you deserve. \nIf you’re feeling dismissed or frustrated with your care, here are a few things you can do: \n\nSpecialist Support: request a doctor with specific knowledge of women’s health and/or menopause. Alternatively, book an appointment with one of The Lowdown’s women’s health doctors or Myla’s menopause experts.\nResearch: empower yourself with information to feel confident asking questions at your next appointment. Get started with our perimenopause blogs and perimenopause product reviews.\nTrack: build a detailed picture of your symptoms to track changes and make informed decisions on your care.\nCompare: check out our perimenopause reviews and HRT reviews. Compare experiences of symptoms and treatment, and help others by sharing your own.\n\n\n\n",

        "Title": "I’m a women’s health GP with primary ovarian insufficiency",
        "Content": "\n✔️If you think this blog will be informative, make sure to check out our newsletter for more:\nPrimary Ovarian Insufficiency and Me…\nI’m Dr Nikki, a Lowdown doctor and GP specialising in women’s health. I also have premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). \nI was diagnosed in early 2023 following a miscarriage the year before. To say it was the most devastating 2 years of my life is an understatement. I lost a whole part of who I thought I was and it took me a while to get to a new “normal” again. \nBefore my diagnosis I had NO idea what POI was. I have a background in gynaecology and obstetrics, yet POI had never been something I had knowledge of. Thankfully that has changed, and fast forward to 2024 and I am now an advocate for women experiencing this condition.\nWhat is primary ovarian insufficiency?\nPremature or Primary Ovarian Insufficiency is a term that describes an earlier than normal slow-down or lack of function in the ovaries that starts under the age of 40 years old. It can impact women as young as 13 if they don’t start having periods at all due to a genetic condition that affects their ovaries.\nIt can also be known as “early menopause”, “premature ovarian failure” or “premature ovarian aging” but these terms are no longer used because they don’t accurately or sensitively describe what is actually going on in a woman’s body. \nWhat are common symptoms?\nPeriod changes can be the first sign of a problem. After my miscarriage in 2022, my periods didn’t return to normal. They were prolonged and light. At one point I was bleeding for 3 weeks solidly. I felt like I was going crazy!\nI also had perimenopausal symptoms, but I didn’t know it at the time. I was tearful, angry and grumpy – sometimes within the same day! I had to nap in the daytime, which isn’t usual for me, and I still felt tired when I woke up. I also had terrible brain fog and forgetfulness, and this still impacts me today even with HRT.\nMy sleep was bad too, I woke up multiple times in the night. I didn’t get night sweats, but I did have the odd hot flush in the day – they are not the same as normal sweating. I literally was dripping with sweat all of a sudden for no obvious reason.\nAnother sign was weight gain. I had changed nothing, but gained 10kg (about 1.5 stone). Looking back at my wedding pictures, it is obvious to me now that something was wrong.\nOther symptoms people might experience include:\n\nFeelings of anxiety for no explicable reason\nAches and pains in the joints\nFrequent urinary tract infections (UTIs)\nLoss of normal vaginal discharge\nPainful intercourse due to vaginal dryness\nTinnitus\nDizziness\nPalpitations\nLoss of interest/lack of motivation in everyday activities\n\nHow do you treat POI?\nHRT – Hormone Replacement Therapy\nThe mainstay of treatment is HRT. Every woman diagnosed with premature ovarian insufficiency needs to be on HRT to protect her bones. I had a DEXA scan to check my bone health when I was diagnosed and discovered that I had osteopenia (bone thinning) in my spine. Without HRT, it is likely to progress to osteoporosis (more severe bone thinning), so I am super conscious of this and making a lot of effort to keep my bones strong through exercise as well. \nThere are lots of ways HRT can be given, such as patches, gels, sprays or HRT pills and even the combined oral contraceptive pill can be used. Everyone is different, so it might take a few tries of different things before you know what is right for you. Using our HRT reviews can help you see what others have found useful, especially if you search for POI reviews.\n\nDiet\nWhile HRT is the main treatment, it can’t hurt to look at your diet. A healthy, balanced diet with everything in moderation is the best advice. Reducing alcohol intake can be helpful for reducing hot flushes. Reducing caffeine can also help with sleep and anxiety symptoms.\nLifestyle\nThe general advice is to stop smoking and ensure that you are exercising regularly. A suggested regime is 150 minutes of cardiovascular exercise per week and an additional 2x sessions of strength training to help your bones to stay strong. I attend yoga classes to help my mental health as well as my strength and flexibility.\nSupplements\nThere is a lot you can do to help keep your body healthy overall with supplements. Taking Vitamin D supplements is an excellent way to keep your bones healthy. Aim for 400-800 international units of vitamin D per day. Some women also gain a lot from supplements like magnesium for sleep and muscle aches. Starflower oil can help with PMS-type symptoms.\nHow to manage your mental health with POI\nMy mental health took a massive hit when I received this diagnosis. I really struggled to see patients, especially those going through miscarriage or trying to conceive. I also had no motivation to do the things I normally enjoyed doing. It was like a piece of my brain had been removed and left a gaping hole that I’m steadily learning to refill. \nYou may feel like this too, so I urge you to get support. This can be through your GP and/or counseling. You’ll likely also have LOADS of questions, so a good resource to plug into is The Daisy Network. They have a supportive Facebook group and online group sessions to help answer your questions plus can offer you mental health support too.\nWhen should you talk to your doctor?\nIf you are feeling symptoms of perimenopause or worsening PMS coupled with changes to your periods, or you’re struggling to get pregnant then the first place to go is your GP. At the very least ask for an FSH (follicular stimulating hormone) blood test to find out if your level is high. If the level is high (over 25), then you need another one 4 to 6 weeks later(2).\nIf it is abnormal, and you are under the age of 40, then this needs investigation and treatment. If your GP is not familiar, then point them in the direction of this guideline.  If your GP can’t help, ask to be referred to a menopause specialist in your area or speak to Dr Nikki at The Lowdown.\nYou will need a bone scan and to start HRT which should be continued until at least the age of natural menopause (age 51). If you’re less than the age of 30, then I highly recommend you see a specialist for genetic screening as well to look for any underlying genetic cause of POI. This could be an endocrinologist or a gynaecologist, but should be a specialist who is experienced with POI.\nCan I get pregnant with POI?\nStudies have shown that around 5-10% of those with POI get pregnant, and we understand how emotive this is, especially if you’ve been diagnosed when young. There’s often pressure to do something about your fertility as soon as you’re diagnosed, but if you’re not in the right headspace for this, then there is no rush. Take time to process the diagnosis first and then explore fertility next. This diagnosis is not the end of your ability to have children. I am on an adoption journey with my husband at the moment! If this is not for you, there are other options like egg donation and IVF to explore.\nEgg donation involves having IVF with someone else’s egg and your partner’s sperm. Many women worry that because the baby isn’t genetically “theirs” they won’t bond, but this is far from the truth. There is lots of research about how the environment of your womb actually changes how the genes of the baby are expressed (5), so they will be impacted by you and will be your child. The other added positive is that the success of this kind of IVF is based on the age and quality of the egg used, NOT on your age or your condition (5).\nBefore ruling out anything, speak to a fertility specialist to decide what your best course of action will be.\nWhere can I get help for POI?\nHere are some resources I recommend to learn more about POI and get support:\nIf you’re into reading, try My Life on Pause by Dr Siobhan O’Sullivan.\nIf you prefer to listen to discussions from women going through similar, try the new podcast “The Premature Menocast” featuring me, Dr Nikki, on Spotify.\nAnd finally, there is a great support group called The Daisy Network.\nI also recommend that you get stuck into The Lowdown’s Perimenopause Review Platform and read about other women’s experiences, and leave your own to help others when you feel ready to.\n\n\n",

        "Title": "What is PCOS belly? The Lowdown on PCOS and bloating",
        "Content": "\n✔️If you think this blog will be informative, make sure to check out our newsletter for more:\nWhat is PCOS?\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal condition. The condition impacts the way the ovaries work and it affects an estimated 8–13% of reproductive-aged women [1]. There are three main symptoms; the first is irregular periods, usually because the ovaries are not regularly releasing eggs. The second is excess levels of androgenic (male) hormones, which can cause acne and excess facial or body hair. And the third common sign or symptom is ovaries which may be enlarged and contain fluid-filled sacs known as follicles, surrounding the eggs seen on ultrasound. You can read about how PCOS affects individuals in The Lowdown community through their shared experiences.\n\nHow PCOS can affect your weight\nIt’s common for people who suffer from PCOS to notice a difference in their weight due to the condition. “The disrupted/elevated hormone levels associated with PCOS can cause weight gain by increasing hunger, supporting storage of fat, and making the breakdown of stored fat harder for the body,” explains Sarah Welsh, gynaecologist and founder of the sexual wellness brand HANX. \nThis means it isn’t simple cause and effect and being diagnosed with PCOS does not mean that you will gain weight. However, many people who have PCOS also have insulin resistance, which experts consider to be a contributing factor to obesity. “This can also make it harder to lose weight, which can be frustrating as some studies show that weight loss is one of the most impactful ways to manage PCOS,” Welsh adds.\nWhat are the stomach symptoms of PCOS?\nPeople who have PCOS might also suffer from various digestive issues. Bloating is very common for people who have PCOS, along with some other problems affecting the stomach. “Bloating is one of the most common symptoms associated with PCOS, alongside gut issues, constipation, diarrhoea and IBS. Some experience pain or discomfort after eating, too,” Welsh says.\n“Research shows that people with PCOS often have an imbalance of gut bacteria, which can impact digestion and result in painful or uncomfortable bloating after meals,” she continues. “It can also be caused by hormones, which is associated with fluid retention.” A recent study published in the journal Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology found that there are “complex and close interactions between PCOS and gut microbiota” [2]. Therapist to restore microbiota in the gut (such as probiotics) could also potentially help to counteract PCOS, according to another study [3].\nWhat is ‘PCOS belly’?\nBloating is one of the most common symptoms of PCOS. In fact, 77% of people with PCOS suffer regularly from bloating, according to a recent study [4].\nThe phrase ‘PCOS belly’ has also been coined to describe the excess abdominal fat many people who suffer from PCOS deal with. Research suggests that people who have PCOS might be more likely to gain weight around the abdominal region, compared to other areas of the body. A 2018 paper [5] found that women with PCOS had around 17% more of both subcutaneous abdominal fat (the fat you can see and feel on your stomach) and visceral abdominal fat (the fat that is found deeper in your organs). We know how emotive weight gain is for you if you have PCOS, and we’re here to support. You can use our reviews to see what has worked for other people, or check out our partner dietitians who are experts in PCOS.\nWhat causes ‘PCOS belly’?\nThere’s no definite answer as to what causes ‘PCOS belly’, but there is some research to suggest what some of the contributing factors might be. Hormonal changes have been linked with bloating in people with PCOS, according to a 2022 study [6]. Researchers working on this paper looked into hormonal changes that may affect gut flora and bile acids associated with digestion, leading to bloating.\nPeople who have PCOS are also more likely to suffer from IBS. 29.7% of people with PCOS also have IBS, compared with 11% of people without PCOS, research in a 2020 study found [7]. Researchers working on this paper theorised that the stress and anxiety associated with PCOS may make IBS more common for people with the condition, as stress can impact gastrointestinal functioning. \nWelsh explains that ‘PCOS belly’ could just come down to the way the body stores fat for people with insulin resistance. “When we’re stressed out or experiencing inflammation, our body produces stress hormones, and increases insulin resistance,” she says. “This means your body can’t properly convert glucose to energy, so it remains stored in the body and can cause weight gain, especially around your middle if you have PCOS.”\nOne other factor to consider is combined oral contraceptives, a type of birth control that many people who suffer from PCOS use to manage their symptoms. Fluid retention (or bloating) is a known side effect of combined contraceptives so the treatment of PCOS could even be causing some of the PCOS belly! \nUltimately, everyone’s bodies are different so everyone’s experience of PCOS and the symptoms that come with it, and why they happen, will be different too. You can anonymously share your experiences of PCOS with The Lowdown community to raise awareness of how the condition affects individuals, and potentially connect with others who have had similar experiences.\n\nIs there anything that can help with PCOS bloating?\nThere are various ways to try and reduce bloating for people who have PCOS. “Medication is an option,”  Welsh says. “There are treatments available, such as Simethicone, which helps reduce gas symptoms such as bloating.” And trialing different brands of combined pill may improve bloating. For example, some people find the pill brands with an anti-androgenic progestogen (like Yasmin, Eloine or Slynd) can improve bloating as they help your body get rid of excess fluid.\nBut there are also a number of diet and lifestyle changes you can make to try to reduce your symptoms. “Eating a Mediterranean diet, which contains fish, healthy fats such as avocado, legumes and plenty of fibre from fruits and vegetables, can help support the good bacteria in your gut and reduce bloating,” Welsh suggests. You can also use supplements to support your healthy gut bacteria, like JERMS.\nThere are certain foods that can induce high levels of insulin, such as red meat, sugary drinks and processed foods, so it’s best to avoid these to reduce PCOS belly. “Some research shows that a cup of green tea a day is beneficial at reducing bloating,” Welsh recommends [8].\nOne PCOS sufferer shared her experience with The Lowdown of switching to a plant-based diet, which improved her symptoms\nRegular exercise is also a good way to reduce bloating. “Even a brisk walk once a day can help with your digestion, improve metabolism and ease discomfort from a sore belly,” Welsh says.\nAre you more likely to bloat during ovulation?\nOvulation is the phase of the menstrual cycle during which the ovary releases an egg as it prepares for a potential pregnancy, which means the body is going through a lot of hormonal changes. “Whether you have PCOS or not, these hormonal changes can cause bloating,” Welsh says. “Oestrogen causes water retention, which can exacerbate bloating.”\nHow can you tell if your bloating is caused by PCOS?\nIt can be difficult to figure out exactly what is causing bloating or weight gain and even more so if you have a condition like PCOS. “It’s best to have an open chat with your GP or health practitioner, and go into your appointment with your ideal outcome in mind,” Welsh recommends.\nIt’s important to remember that bloating can be caused by other medical conditions, so you should always speak to your healthcare provider. Especially if the bloating is associated with any other symptoms like urinary or bowel problems, bleeding from the back passage or usual vaginal bleeding or discharge. \n“They’ll likely want to understand your health history, run some hormone or blood tests and possibly an ultrasound scan to help determine if you have PCOS,” she continues. “From there, they should also be able to determine if your bloating is indeed PCOS related, or something different.”\n\n\n",

        "Title": "Should I take Inositol for PCOS?",
        "Content": "\n✔️If you think this blog will be informative, make sure to check out our newsletter for more:\nWhat is PCOS?\nPolycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal condition that is fairly common for people with ovaries, affecting an estimated 8–13% of reproductive-aged women [1]. It’s a condition that is defined by its symptoms, which includes having polycystic ovaries – this doesn’t actually refer to having cysts on the ovaries, but the appearance of follicles, which are tiny sacs containing eggs, around the ovaries. Other symptoms include menstrual irregularities due to disrupted ovulation and elevated levels of ‘male’ androgen  hormones (like testosterone),  which can cayse excessive hair growth and acne, as well as insulin resistance.  \n\nWhat is insulin resistance?\nInsulin resistance is one of the most common symptoms of PCOS [2]. But what does this actually mean? Well, insulin is a hormone the body naturally produces that helps manage blood sugar levels but many people who have PCOS are resistant to it. “Insulin resistance is a condition where the body’s cells don’t respond effectively to insulin,” explains Dr. Amit Shah, leading gynaecologist & co-founder of Fertility Plus. “This can lead to elevated insulin levels, contributing to various symptoms and potentially increasing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the long run.” \nOne of the reasons insulin resistance is an issue for people with PCOS is because it can lead to elevated insulin levels in the bloodstream, disrupting the hormonal balance required for ovarian function. “This hormonal disruption can manifest in irregular menstrual cycles, infertility and increased production of androgens,” Dr Shah says, adding: “Many individuals with PCOS also face challenges with weight management, as excess weight, particularly abdominal fat, can intensify insulin resistance.”\nWhat is inositol?\nInositol is a naturally occurring sugar alcohol that occurs in the body, as well as in some foods. “Citrus fruits like oranges, grapefruits, and lemons are particularly rich in inositol, along with legumes such as lentils and chickpeas,” Dr Shah says. You’ll most often find it in plant-based foods, rather than meat and dairy, according to Dr Shah, including the ones he listed above, as well as nuts and seeds and whole grains like whole wheat, brown rice, and oats are additional sources of inositol. You can also take it in supplement form and it’s often used to help manage PCOS symptoms.”PCOS is often characterised by insulin resistance, and myo-inositol is known to positively impact insulin sensitivity in individuals,” explains Dr Shah.\nHow do you take inositol?\n“Inositol is available in several different forms, and can be tailored to specific needs and applications,” Dr Shah says, adding that: “The most prevalent and biologically active form is myo-inositol, which is commonly used as a dietary supplement to promote hormonal balance.” Myo-inositol is available in various forms, including powders, capsules and tablets. “Another form is D-chiro-inositol (DCI), which also plays a role in insulin signalling and is often used alongside myo-inositol to enhance its effectiveness in managing insulin resistance and connected symptoms,” Dr Shah says. You can also find combinations of both forms of the hormones to promote healthy and balanced hormonal and metabolic support. In terms of dosage, it’s best to consult your healthcare practitioner to figure out what’s right for you.\nWhat are the benefits of taking inositol and how long does it take to work?\nTaking inositol supplements can improve many of the symptoms associated with PCOS. “Inositol can potentially help with weight management, improving insulin sensitivity, regulating menstrual cycles and lowering elevated androgen levels,” Dr Shah explains. One of the other benefits of inositol is that it can improve metabolic health for people with insulin sensitivity. One study also found that taking myoinositol supplements can lower blood sugar levels and the risk of gestational diabetes for people with PCOS [3].\nWhat are the potential side effects of taking inositol?\nAccording to Dr Shah, inositol is generally considered safe and most people can tolerate it well when it’s taken at the recommended dose. However, there are some potential side effects to be aware of, especially for people who have PCOS symptoms. “Digestive issues like nausea, gas, bloating, or diarrhoea can occur for some,” Dr Shah says, adding: “Headaches or migraines may manifest, but these are known to be quite rare side effects, as well as sleep disturbances in some cases.” \nIn a 2019 study published in the Journal of Ovarian Research, inositol was linked to hair loss, but only in some cases [4]. \nDr Shah says one of the main things to be aware of is how any medications you are currently taking could interfere with taking inositol, particularly lithium or diabetes medications. “This is because when combined with inositol, their efficacy can be affected and you may be exposed to a higher risk of side effects,” he explains. So please take care to discuss inositol with your pharmacist before you start taking it if you are on long term medications.\nCan inositol help with infertility?\nYes, inositol may be able to help with fertility. There are a number of studies to show that taking inositol supplements can improve fertility outcomes for people with PCOS. A 2019 study published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences found that people with PCOS taking a specific dosage of a type of inositol supplement had significantly better ovulation and fertility rates [5]. \n“Research shows that myo-inositol can enhance ovulatory function and menstrual regularity — essential factors for enhancing optimal fertility,” Dr Shah says. “By promoting more regular ovulatory cycles, myo-inositol increases the likelihood of natural conception.” Because inositol also regulates hormonal balance, it encourages more regular menstrual cycles, which can help improve timings for conception. \n“Myo-inositol has been found to reduce the elevated androgen levels that are typically associated with PCOS, therefore improving reproductive function,” Dr Shah adds. \n\nOne study found that inositol can also restore ovulation and improve egg quality, although taking the correct formulation is very important because if the dosage is too high, this could have a negative impact on immature eggs, also known as oocytes [6]. “Egg quality is essential for successful fertilisation and embryo development,” Dr Shah says, explaining why these findings are so promising.\nHowever, it’s important to remember that individual responses to inositol supplementation will vary and it’s often used alongside other treatments or lifestyle changes that also support fertility. Dr Shah stresses the importance of speaking to a healthcare professional before taking inositol in supplement form, to figure out if it’s right for you.\nWhere can I get inositol?\nInositol is available to purchase at pharmacies and you can also speak to your health practitioner about where to find it. MyOva‘s inositol supplement is available to buy at The Lowdown and you can read some incredible reviews from our Lowdown community who’ve already tried it.\n\n",

        "Title": "HRT and Progesterone &#8211; the facts",
        "Content": "\nWhat is HRT?\nHRT stands for hormone replacement therapy. This is a medication used to treat perimenopausal and menopausal symptoms. It is an amazing treatment for hot flushes and the mood and anxiety symptoms of menopause. HRT can also have long term benefits to your health. HRT can protect your bones from thinning and reduce the risk of heart attacks or strokes. This is if you start it within 10 years of your last period and before the age of 60. HRT can have some small risks. For the majority of people using HRT, the benefits of it far outweighs these small risks. This blog will talk about the risk of oestrogen on your womb and the importance of progesterone in HRT.\nWhy do you need oestrogen and progesterone in HRT?\nMost of your peri and menopausal symptoms are due to decreasing levels of oestrogen in your body. HRT replaces this oestrogen to make you feel better! But, if you have a uterus, you must also have progesterone in your HRT. This is because oestrogen can cause your womb lining to thicken and overgrow. There is a risk that over many years, this can develop into cancer. Progesterone thins the womb lining, so protects your womb lining from the oestrogen.\nWhat is endometrial protection?\nEndometrial protection, or womb protection, is the medical description for making sure that you have the right amount of progesterone in your HRT to stop your womb lining from overgrowing and increasing the risk of cancer. The endometrium is the medical word for the lining of the uterus or womb.\nWhat happens if you only take oestrogen without progesterone?\nIf you just take oestrogen without any progesterone, this increases the risk of overgrowth of your womb lining which can develop into cancer. Oestrogen only HRT is therefore only usually given to those who have had a hysterectomy (surgery to remove their womb). If you have a womb, taking progesterone keeps the womb lining thin, or allows your womb lining to be shed as a bleed each month, protecting the womb lining from the effects of oestrogen. \n\nHow much progesterone should I take for HRT?\n\nThe amount of progesterone you should take as part of your HRT depends on the type of progesterone you are using and the dose of oestrogen you are using. Using the hormonal coil is easy, the same dose of hormonal coil (containing 52 mg of levonorgestrel) is used for all oestrogen doses. If you are using a combined tablet or patch, these usually have the perfect dose of progesterone for your oestrogen together in one tablet or patch. However, if you choose to take your progesterone separately from your oestrogen, it’s really important to know the levels that are needed for each dose of oestrogen. Your doctor or nurse should do this but you can check you are on the right dose using the table below.\nWhat is cyclical or continuous progesterone?\nCyclical (also called sequential) HRT is when the progesterone hormone is only taken for part of the cycle, and you will usually have a monthly bleed. You will usually start with this if you are perimenopausal and still having periods when you start HRT. The number of days you need to take progesterone, and the dose required, varies between different types of progesterone and your oestrogen dose. Your healthcare professional will explain the correct dose and number of days to take it. Continuous HRT is when progesterone is taken at the same dose every day, and is designed to prevent bleeding. If you’ve not had a period for over a year when you start HRT you will usually start continuous HRT.\nWhen should I switch between cyclical and continuous progesterone?\nIf you are using cyclical or sequential HRT, the British Menopause Society recommends you should switch to continuous HRT when you are 54 years old, or (if you are over the age of 45) have used cyclical HRT for 5 years. Continuous HRT is better at protecting your womb lining from overgrowing and developing into cancer, and that is why this switch is recommended.\nWhat happens if I take too much progesterone?\nIf you accidentally take an extra dose of progesterone, it is unlikely to cause any problems. The main problem with progesterone is the side effects. These can include anxiety, mood change, PMS like symptoms, breast tenderness, bleeding and bloating. Some progesterones, especially Utrogestan, can cause drowsiness.\n\nWhat are the side effects of progesterone in HRT?\nEach person will experience side effects of progesterone differently. The common side effects include:\n\nIrregular bleeding\nHeadaches\nBloating\nMood changes and anxiety\nAcne\nPMS like symptoms\nBreast pain and tenderness\nDrowsiness\n\nHow do I know if I am progesterone sensitive or intolerant?\nYou may be sensitive or intolerant to progesterone if you start to have severe side effects soon after starting HRT containing progesterone. Intolerance to progesterone might be more likely if you have suffered with hormonal problems in the past such as PMS, postnatal depression or side effects to hormonal contraceptives.\nFor most people, the side effects start to reduce after time, so if you can stick them out for a few weeks they usually get better. However, if the side effects are having a huge impact on your life, please speak to your healthcare professiona. Remember, the progesterone part of your HRT is very important, so please get support and do not change the dose yourself or stop taking it altogether.\nWhat can I do if I am progesterone sensitive or intolerant?\nIf you are sensitive to the progesterone part of HRT, please speak to your healthcare professional. Progesterones can be given in different ways which may improve your side effects, for example, given vaginally rather than orally. And there are lots of different types of progesterone, so you can try other options. For example, some of the older progesterones are better at stopping bleeding side effects than the newer ones. It may be a bit of trial and error, but most people can find something that suits them. If you need support with this, our menopause specialist partners are Myla Health are here to help.\n\nWhat is the difference between synthetic and body identical progesterone in HRT?\nThe difference between synthetic and body identical progesterone is their chemical structure. Synthetic progesterones are also called progestogens in the UK or progestins in the US. They have been made for many years in labs. The chemical structure of synthetic progesterones is very slightly different from the natural progesterone that our body makes. Therefore, these synthetic progesterones can cause slightly different side effects.\nBody identical progesterones, like Utrogestan or in Bijuve, have the exact same chemical structure as the progesterone our body makes. However, they are still made in a lab from sweet potatoes or yams! Body identical progesterones may have fewer side effects and don’t increase your risk of breast cancer for at least 5 years of use.\nThere is no right or wrong choice between synthetic or body identical progesterones, you can choose which type you use as an individual based on your side effects and preferences. We’ve made it easy to do your own research on The Lowdown’s HRT platform, by including whether the hormone is body identical or synthetic on each HRT brand you search!\n\n",

        "Title": "PCOS acne and how to treat it",
        "Content": "\n✔️If you think this blog sounds informative, make sure to check out our newsletter for more:\nAcne is a common feature of PCOS, affecting a huge number of people with the condition[1]. Let’s face it, it’s a frustrating symptom as acne is visible and can affect your self esteem and mental health. But don’t worry, there are treatments to manage acne, and The Lowdown is here to help.\nWhat causes acne in people with PCOS?\nAcne is a skin condition that is caused when glands in the skin called sebaceous glands make too much oil. This oil along with dead skin cells build up and block the pores in the skin causing blackheads. The extra oily environment is also a friendly place for a bacteria found on the skin to multiply causing red, inflamed and pus filled or cystic spots[2].\nThe sebaceous glands are controlled by hormones, and higher levels of androgens trigger the glands to make more oil. Androgens including testosterone are typically higher in PCOS, leading to acne.\n\nWhere is acne found in people with PCOS?\nAcne is usually seen on the face, neck, back and upper chest. Research has found that PCOS acne may be found most commonly on the cheeks and forehead[1], but may also be found on the lower jawline where hormonal acne tends to flare.\nWhat causes PCOS acne flare ups?\nFlare ups are so annoying, just when you think you’re winning, out the spots come before a first date or fancy social event – you’re not alone. The most common cause of an acne flare is before a period (between 40-85% of us!)[3,4] Around this time, you may find your skin is more oily and prone to breakouts of spots. This is due to hormonal fluctuations and an increase in androgens before a period. \nMore research has been carried out looking at the risks for flares in those with adult female acne, not just PCOS acne. These studies suggest that stress can contribute to flares.[5,6]\nYou may also find yourself trapped in the cycle of covering up acne using cosmetics, which can then worsen flares, especially full cover foundation[6,7]. \nDiet is also important in flares – not eating your 5 a day of fruit and veg, eating too much greasy food and large amounts of dairy may worsen acne but higher quality research is needed.[7,8]\nHow to tell the difference between normal acne and PCOS acne?\nAcne is exceptionally common, affecting 95% of people between the ages of 11 and 30[10]. You should suspect you have PCOS related acne if you develop other symptoms such as irregular or no periods, unwanted hair growth or difficulty getting pregnant. If acne is persisting over the age of 25, this is known as adult acne and PCOS is found in almost half of women with adult acne[9]. If you’re struggling with acne and are worried that PCOS could be the underlying cause, please speak to your healthcare provider about further tests to get a diagnosis.\n“From my teenage years, I have always had irregular periods ranging from 2 -6 week cycles which were often heavy, fatigue, suffered on and off with acne and when I started suffering with hirsutism I knew something really wasn’t right.”\nCan PCOS acne be managed with diet?\nThe research into acne and diet isn’t fantastic but there is evidence that certain dietary changes can help. A review of all the research suggests that a diet of milk, chocolate and high glycaemic foods (carbohydrates that digest quickly like white bread and sugary foods) may worsen acne. Increasing your fruit, vegetables and foods that contain omega-3 such as oily fish may help[12]. There is also evidence that a lower carbohydrate diet[13], anti-inflammatory diet[14] and reducing refined sugar while concentrating on lean meats and vegetables improve PCOS symptoms overall[15]. Unfortunately, none of these studies have been large or continued for a long time to generate good quality data, but we suspect that an overall healthy diet is one factor to reduce PCOS symptoms including acne. We encourage healthy, gradual changes to your diet and lifestyle that are manageable and fit into your life.\n“I read a lot about changing diet and lifestyle. I went gluten free, dairy free, refined sugar free and alcohol free – intense and hard to adapt at the start. But within a couple of months weight dropped off me, I had a period every month without fail.”\nHow else can PCOS acne be managed?\nAcne can be managed in loads of different ways from lifestyle and skin care changes to medications. Medicated creams and gels can be purchased from pharmacies or prescribed by your doctor.\nOral contraceptives are a treatment for both acne and PCOS – and our specialism at The Lowdown. There are various brands of combined contraceptive pill which may be better at improving the hormonal acne associated with PCOS. The progestogen contained in different pill brands can affect the androgen levels within the body. Many people with PCOS will have great results with the standard brand of pills such as Rigevidon, Ovranette or Microgynon. Others may find brands that contain a progestogen called drospirenone are better for acne, such as Yasmin, Eloine or Lucette.\nSpironolactone is a medication that has traditionally been used to treat heart conditions. But as spironolactone is related to drospirenone, it can reduce the effect of androgens and rebalance hormones to help treat acne and PCOS symptoms.\n“spironolactone did resolve my symptoms. Once Yasmin came onto the market, I switched to that (using just 3 of the placebo pills), and that controlled my symptoms just as well for 10+ years.”\nAcne can be tough, especially if you’re also managing the myriad of symptoms that PCOS can throw at you too. If you need us, The Lowdown is here to listen, reassure and support through our fabulous doctors and community.\n\n\n",

        "Title": "What treatments actually work for PCOS?",
        "Content": "\n✔️If you think this blog sounds informative, make sure to check out our newsletter for more:\nWe’ve asked the Lowdown community what helps to manage their symptoms best and we’re sharing it here.\nWhat happens after you get diagnosed? – being left in the dark after getting your diagnosis\nAfter getting a diagnosis of PCOS it is easy to feel lost and unsure about what is best to do next. While PCOS cannot be cured, thankfully there are lots of things you can do to maintain good health and manage your symptoms\nMake sure you keep a log of your periods and tell your healthcare provider if you are having less than 4 per year (if you’re not on hormonal contraception) because this needs treatment.\nIf you are on contraception, but getting unwanted side-effects like acne, you may want to discuss if switching might be helpful.\nIf you are trying to conceive, asking for help from a fertility specialist can help to improve your chance of success. \nKeeping an eye on your weight and maintaining this at healthy levels can be really beneficial at managing PCOS and keeping symptoms under control.\nYour doctor can prescribe treatments for acne such as topical creams and oral antibiotics. \nIf excess, annoying hair on the face and body is a symptom then standard hair removal treatments and bleaching may be helpful too.\nThe Lowdown Community Spoke! Here is what you find most helpful\nExercise\nThe general recommendation is that all adults should undertake physical activity; doing something is better than none at all! \nA combination of cardio and strength training is best, with a minimum of 150 minutes per week of moderate to vigorous intensity spread throughout the week. Muscle strengthening and flexibility is also important, and this should ideally be on two non-consecutive days of the week in addition to cardio exercise.\nDietary changes\nPCOS symptoms can be linked to diet and weight. It can be really hard to lose weight with PCOS, so we advise to concentrate on health rather than the scales, this way, the weight often starts to come off anyway! Aim to eat healthily, particularly foods rich in unsaturated “good” fats like omega-3 and foods packed full of nutrients (such as folic acid, b-vitamins and magnesium), low glycaemic index foods and wholegrains.\nStress management\nStress can make everything feel worse and can lead to unhealthy coping mechanisms such as over eating, especially high GI foods and processed saturated fats. Trying to conceive can add to the pressure and keeping stress to a minimum can be hard to do. \nLearning some good stress-busting techniques such as breathing exercises, meditation and practising yoga can all help to keep you in flow. Work on a good sleep routine as well to get those much needed z’s in!\nVitamin D\nThis gets a special mention because many in the Lowdown community have tried this and found it useful. The research between PCOS and vitamin D deficiency isn’t fully understood, but maintaining a good level may improve insulin sensitivity and regulate menstrual cycles and hormone levels. On the whole, if you live in the UK or any country where the sun doesn’t come out as much, your vitamin D levels likely need regularly topping up, especially in the winter months. If you cover up or stay inside a lot and if you have a darker skin tone, then you should take it all year round. A daily intake of 400 international units is advised for everyone, but up to 1000 international units per day is thought to be safe. \nInositol\nInositols are sugars found in fruits and beans, and they work alongside hormones in the body, including insulin. A breakdown with these connections can lead to insulin resistance and ultimately diabetes. It is thought that inositol supplements can improve PCOS symptoms. Taking an inositol supplement might be something to add to your daily PCOS management. It’s not something that can be prescribed, but there are lots of options that can be purchased online in the form of myo-inositol.\nContraception\n\nEven if you don’t need contraception, managing your periods is key to keeping your womb healthy with PCOS. \nOften, periods are very irregular which can be irritating. But this doesn’t always need treating if enough periods are happening. However, if a person with PCOS is having less than 4 periods a year, then this needs treatment to prevent the womb lining for overgrowing which can lead to problems in the future. Hormonal contraception is one way to protect your womb.\nTreatment guidelines recommend starting with the combined oral contraceptive pill if you’re eligible. For those with symptoms of androgen excess in particular, aiming for a pill that has the least impact on androgen excess is important.\nIf you can’t take oestrogen, don’t worry progestogen only contraception can also be used as treatment for PCOS. The Lowdown medical team can help you find something that  you best.\nIf you don’t fancy the idea of being on long term contraception, having a withdrawal bleed brought on by a progesterone pill like Provera 10mg for 10 to 14 days every 3 months will help to keep your womb healthy.\nHow can you manage PCOS through pregnancy? Can you take supplements?\nCongratulations! The road to pregnancy with PCOS can be hard for some people, so if it has been a struggle for you, congratulations on making it through. \n\nAdvice on managing PCOS in pregnancy is much the same as for those who do not have PCOS, but with a few additions. \nIt’s important to take folic acid and vitamin D in pregnancy, ideally even before getting pregnant. If you have a BMI of over 30, the dose of folic acid should be 5mg which needs to be prescribed by your GP.\nVitamin D at a standard dose of 10 micrograms (400 international units) is recommended for all pregnant women.\nThe extra addition to management of PCOS in pregnancy is blood sugar monitoring. In those who are not pregnant, and have a high risk for developing diabetes, an annual oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to check blood sugar is advised to watch out for signs of diabetes developing. In practice, many doctors will perform an HbA1c as it’s a quick and easy blood test to do, and an OGTT takes several hours to perform. \nPregnancy can temporarily accelerate this process and lead to gestational diabetes, especially for those with PCOS. This tends to improve once the baby is delivered. \nTo check for signs of this in pregnancy an oral glucose tolerance test ideally should be offered before 20 weeks pregnant, and all pregnant women with PCOS should be offered an OGTT at 24–28 weeks pregnant. An HbA1c blood test is not good enough to check for diabetes in pregnancy. If these tests pick anything up – it’s a good thing to know, as you can have extra support to keep your pregnancy and baby healthy.\nThe Lowdown’s community online support\nPCOS is a common condition and that means that there is a vast array of experience out there to learn from. You can use the Lowdown platform to read PCOS experiences and share your PCOS experience too so you can give back and help others.

        "Content": "\nWhat is PCOS?\nPCOS stands for polycystic ovary syndrome. It is common, affecting around 10% of women and can be described as a hormonal, metabolic or endocrine condition. PCOS is a collection of signs and symptoms which can include: irregular or absent periods, high levels of testosterone in the bloodstream (which can cause acne or unwanted hair growth) or a typical appearance of the ovaries on an ultrasound scan. Women experience PCOS and the symptoms in many different ways, which you can see from our shared experiences.\n\nPCOS can have an impact on many aspects of your health, which are important to be aware of so you can manage them. These include your cholesterol level, diabetes risk, fertility and risk of womb cancer. This sounds scary, but knowledge is power, so read more to learn about how to manage these risks.\nWhat causes PCOS?\nWe don’t fully understand what causes PCOS yet, but we do have some clues. \nThere is a genetic link where some women inherit a higher risk of developing PCOS. However, many other factors also play a role as to why these women go on to develop PCOS such as diet, exercise and other lifestyle or environmental factors.\nHormones are key in PCOS – with testosterone and insulin being major players. Testosterone levels are usually higher in those with PCOS, which can cause some of the symptoms. \nPeople with PCOS may be “insulin resistant” which means their body doesn’t react as well to the hormone insulin. Insulin is the hormone which helps our body store and use sugar from food. Insulin resistance seems to affect the functioning of the ovaries and contributes to the hormonal imbalance in PCOS.\nWe all agree that there isn’t enough research into PCOS – how do we not even know what causes a condition that affects 10% of women!\nHow is PCOS diagnosed?\nCurrently, to diagnose PCOS, doctors use the “Rotterdam criteria”. This is a triad of signs or symptoms and you have to meet 2 out of the 3 to be diagnosed.\nThese are:\n1 . Irregular or absent periods\nMedical definition – less than 8 periods per year or a cycle length of less than 21 or more than 35 days OR no period for over 90 days\n2. High levels of androgens\nMedical definition – a higher than normal level of testosterone on blood tests OR unwanted hair growth, acne or hair loss\n3. Appearance of polycystic ovaries on an ultrasound\nMedical definition – more than 20 follicles (small fluid filled sacs) seen on at least one ovary OR an ovary that is more than 10ml in size\nRecent guidelines suggest that a blood test called AMH (anti-mullerian hormone) could be used instead of an ultrasound scan which might help speed up diagnosis. It’s important to know that an ultrasound and AMH level can’t be used for diagnosis of PCOS within 8 years of you starting your period.\nWhat are ovarian cysts v ovarian follicles?\nWe have no idea why it’s called polycystic ovary syndrome because they’re not actually cysts that are found on the ovaries, they are follicles. Follicles are small fluid filled sacs on the ovary which contain immature eggs. In PCOS, these follicles don’t mature and release their egg so they accumulate on the ovary and can be seen on ultrasound. \nOvarian cysts, however, are fluid filled sacs that don’t contain an immature egg and are over 3cm in size. Ovarian cysts are really common and don’t necessarily mean you have PCOS.\nCan you get pregnant with PCOS? \nYes, you can get pregnant with PCOS! 60% of those with PCOS will have no problems getting pregnant. Even for those couples who find it more difficult to conceive, fertility treatment is usually successful. If you have PCOS or suspect you do, getting early advice can really make a difference. Our specialist fertility nurse can help you get started to optimise your fertility and using Ovusense (highly recommended by our community) identifies where in your cycle you need support.\n\nCan you develop PCOS in later life?\nPCOS symptoms can appear at any point in your reproductive life. However, it’s most common to have symptoms from your late teens into your 20s. Many people discover they have PCOS at the point of trying to get pregnant, or if they start to gain weight. However, the advice and treatments are still the same, whatever age you are. We know that the symptoms caused by high levels of androgens in PCOS can persist after menopause, so may continue well into later life in some people.\nWhat is the difference between PCO and PCOS?\nPCO is when your ovaries have the appearance of polycystic ovaries on ultrasound but you don’t have any other symptoms of PCOS. Medics and scientists actually use the abbreviation PCOM (standing for polycystic ovary morphology) on ultrasound scan. PCOS is the ultrasound changes combined with the symptoms needed for diagnosis (see above…). We don’t know why some people have PCO but no symptoms, and others do – but it’s likely a combination of genetics, lifestyle and environmental factors that contribute.\nPCOS symptom FAQs\nWhat are the first signs of PCOS?\nThe first signs of PCOS can be different for each individual. The most common ones are likely to be:\n\nA change in your cycle, often becoming more irregular, usually with more than 35 days between each period\nWorsening acne that might not be easily treated\nHair growth in unwanted areas like on the chin, face or around the nipples, on the chest or the back\nThinning of your hair all over the head\nWeight gain despite no change in diet or exercise\nStruggling to get pregnant.\n\nHowever, everyone is individual, so symptoms can start at different times and you may experience a combination of the above. Please leave a review about your PCOS symptoms to help others. In some cases there may be other causes for these symptoms and if you’re worried, make sure you speak to your healthcare professional.\n\nWhat are the main symptoms of PCOS?\nThe main symptoms of PCOS are:\n\nIrregular periods or even none at all\nWeight changes including rapid weight gain and struggling to lose weight\nAcne or oily skin\nUnwanted hair growth on the face or body, which is called hirsutism\nLoss of hair or thinning of the hair on your head\nMood changes including depression and anxiety\nDifficulty getting pregnant and miscarriage\n\nHowever, this is not an exhaustive list, there are many other signs and symptoms that are caused by PCOS which research and our community describe. \nSome of the other symptoms and other factors that may impact on your health include:\n\nDisordered eating\nInsulin resistance\nSnoring (from a condition called obstructive sleep apnoea)\nSexual problems\nAn increased risk of high cholesterol, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes\nOvergrowth of the womb lining which over many years may develop into cancer\n\nThis may be a lot to read and feel very overwhelming. But don’t worry, the first step is a diagnosis, then with good management, you are often able to control many of these symptoms with a collection of monitoring, lifestyle changes and sometimes medications.\nIs PCOS painful?\nSome people say that polycystic ovaries cannot cause pain, but every person will experience PCOS symptoms in different ways, and at The Lowdown we believe in listening to and validating your experience. Many of our community say that PCOS can be painful. \nPain felt in PCOS could be due to a multitude of reasons; ovulation pain, heavy periods, bloating or cystic acne. It is important, however, to not attribute all pain to your diagnosis of PCOS, and if something does not feel right with your body, get it checked out by a healthcare professional.\nCan you have PCOS and endometriosis?\nYes, you can have both PCOS and endometriosis. Both are separate conditions, and both affect around 10% of the female population so there is likely to be many people who suffer from them both. And of course, this includes some of The Lowdown community. If you want to hear from more people who have suffered from both conditions, search for endometriosis through our PCOS experiences.\n\nPCOS treatment FAQs\nWhat treatments are there for PCOS?\nThere are many different treatments for PCOS, some which focus on specific symptoms, and others which treat your overall health.\nOften the most successful treatments are lifestyle changes. These can be hard to stick to, but by making small changes in lots of areas, they can add up to a huge difference. Concentrate on exercise, moving your body and using your muscles and focus on healthy diet changes that you can stick to. These will help your PCOS symptoms, any mood or anxiety symptoms and improve your overall health and wellbeing.\nHowever, the treatments below can help with more specific symptoms.\n\nIrregular periods can be treated with hormones and contraceptives or with supplements containing inositol such as MyOva.\nAcne treatments can be bought from pharmacies and creams or antibiotics can be prescribed from your GP. The combined pill can help, but if you can’t use it, then specialist doctors can prescribe strong drugs called spironolactone or Roaccutane (also called isotretinoin).\nHair growth is frustrating but can, again, be helped by hormonal contraceptives (read more about the best pill for hair growth) or by hair removal methods like waxing, plucking, creams or laser.\nFertility treatment is available if you are trying to conceive from specialists. You can learn more about PCOS and fertility here.\n\n\nWhat contraception is best for PCOS?\nThe best contraception for PCOS depends on the symptoms you are treating. The combined pill is very good at treating acne and irregular periods. Pill brands such as Yasmin, Eloine or Dianette which contain a progestogen that reduce the effect of androgens associated with PCOS may be better than standard combined pills.\nOther contraceptives can be excellent at controlling heavy, irregular bleeds and also help protect the womb lining from overgrowing, which is a risk with PCOS if you have irregular periods. These include the hormonal coil, progestogen only pill, implant and injection.\nIs there a diet that’s best for PCOS?\nNo, there is no diet that is best for PCOS. Some healthcare professionals will advocate a keto or low carb diet, but there is no evidence that this is better than any other type of diet. The best diet for PCOS, is an overall healthy one, that you can stick to day to day without developing disordered eating and that keeps you feeling good about yourself. Aim to make healthier choices, include plenty of fruit, vegetables and fibre and just keep an eye on portion size. If you’re aiming to lose weight, do this slowly and steadily, and if you need more support, speak to a dietitian or nutritionist who has expertise in women’s health or PCOS. If you’ve found a particular approach helpful – please share your experience to help others.\n\nHow can I lose weight if I have PCOS? \nWeight loss in PCOS is complex and can be difficult – but it isn’t impossible. However, the approach from our Lowdown doctors may shock you. They advise you to stop looking at the scales and measuring weight. Yes, we know that PCOS symptoms and your overall health improve with weight loss, but we also know that the pressure to lose weight and weight stigma affect your mental health and risk disordered eating. Instead focus on fitness, move your body and use your muscles (really important in PCOS as more muscles helps your metabolism). Concentrate on a healthy diet and normal portion control. By having an overall health approach, rather than focussing on weight, you will often find that weight loss follows.\nHowever, if you want specific help, speaking to a dietician or health coach can help with advice and to set goals. \nMetformin is a medication which can be offered to women who have PCOS as it can manage symptoms, improve insulin resistance and can help with weight loss.\nNewer injectable medications such as ozempic may be available if you have a high BMI and other health problems such as high blood pressure or type 2 diabetes, which are more common in people with PCOS.\nRemember, with the right information, support and motivation you CAN lose weight with PCOS, but don’t be disheartened if you need to try a few different lifestyle changes to see those scales move, go off how you FEEL. Check out our user experiences to see how other women have managed, or leave your own to help others.\n\nCan you cure PCOS permanently?\nUnfortunately, you can’t cure PCOS permanently. The high levels of androgens associated with PCOS which can cause many of the symptoms persist after menopause. However, you can manage the symptoms.\nIt’s really important to understand the long term implications of PCOS to your health, especially as the condition won’t go away.\nIf you have PCOS, you are at a higher risk of developing high blood pressure, high cholesterol and type 2 diabetes. We don’t want to panic or upset anyone but you should know this so you can take steps to look after your health and prevent these. You need to make sure you attend regular monitoring and health checks as you get older to pick up any problems early. Finally, bleeding is very important. Unless you are on hormonal contraception, you have to bleed 4 times a year if you have PCOS. If you don’t, you are at risk of your womb lining overgrowing which over many years can become cancerous. Your doctor can prescribe hormonal medication 4 times a year to induce a bleed if you do not want hormonal contraception. And finally, if your bleeds suddenly change and become much heavier – speak to a doctor, because this can be a sign of overgrowth of the womb lining and if you have PCOS, you should be offered further investigation.\nAgain, we don’t mean to scare you. PCOS can’t be cured but can be managed, as long as you have the right information and education to empower you!\n",

        "Content": "\n✔️If you think this blog sounds informative, make sure to check out our newsletter for more:\nDoes Endometriosis cause bloating?\nEndometriosis is a common women’s health condition affecting around 1 in 10 women. If you’re an endo sufferer, you know that there is a wide range of symptoms including pain, diarrhoea, fatigue, urinary symptoms…..and also bloating. Here we delve into endometriosis bloating, helped by descriptions from our Lowdown community.\nWhat is endo belly?\nEndo belly is bloating or swelling of your abdomen usually due to gas, which usually happens just before and during your period. The endometriosis bloating can feel like a tight pain and cause a lot of discomfort. It is defined medically as “cyclical bloating of the abdomen”.[1]\n“…bloating that worsens pre-menstrually and menstrually”\nIs endo belly or bloating a common symptom of endometriosis?\nEndo belly or bloating is a very common symptom. In fact, bloating is really common in anyone who has a period. However, if you don’t have endometriosis, bloating will affect around 2/3rds (64%) of people, compared to almost all (96%) of people who have endometriosis. Endo belly is known to be more extreme than usual period related bloating.[2]\nWhat causes bloating or endo belly?\nEndometriosis causes deposits of tissue similar to the womb lining to grow outside of the womb, such as on the pelvic wall, ovaries or intestines. These deposits thicken and bleed throughout your menstrual cycle causing inflammation in your pelvis and abdomen. An imbalance of the gut microbiome is thought to worsen this inflammation. Over time (and we know endometriosis takes a LONG time to diagnose), this increased inflammation causes bloating, abdominal and pelvic pain and bowel symptoms.[1]\n\nWhat’s the difference between endo belly and IBS?\n“I went back and forth to my GP with IBS symptoms from the age of 17 to 36, but never felt like I got anywhere.”\nEndo belly and IBS can have similar overlapping features of bloating and bowel changes, meaning that patients can get diagnosed incorrectly with IBS when the problem is actually endometriosis.\n“I first went to the GP with bloating and pain when I was 15. I didn’t get diagnosed with endometriosis until I was 35. I was misdiagnosed with IBS for my bowel symptoms.”\nThe key differences are the triggers and patterns of the bloating. Endo belly is almost always associated with periods and the menstrual cycle, whereas IBS bloating happens after eating certain foods or due to stress and doesn’t follow a monthly pattern.[3]\nIs endo belly hard or soft?\nEveryone experiences endo belly differently, but usually it will feel tight or hard. However, if you have soft bloating, this doesn’t mean it isn’t caused by endometriosis, especially if you have other symptoms such as very painful periods.\n“The pain is pretty debilitating and I suffer with bloating, stomach and pelvic pain most days. When it’s daily you start to feel pretty rubbish as it affects work and social life but I know I’m not alone.”\nWhat are the gut related symptoms of endometriosis?\nEndometriosis has been described as a “systemic” disease which means it is widespread and affects many different organs.[4] The intestine can be involved as endometrial deposits can be found both on the surface of, or penetrating into the gut wall.[5] The gut related symptoms of endometriosis include:\n\nAbdominal pain\nNausea and vomiting\nPain on opening the bowels\nConstipation OR diarrhoea\nBleeding from the back passage\nA sensation of not fully emptying the bowels called tenesmus\n\nWhen is it not normal bloating? When should I see a doctor?\nWhile bloating is common in endometriosis, it can also be found in other conditions. Bloating can be a normal part of your menstrual cycle, or a PMS symptom but may be a symptom of other gut conditions such as coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel disease and not forgetting pregnancy!\nIf you have severe, tight bloating every month, especially if this is alongside bowel symptoms, bleeding from the bowels, weight loss, vomiting after eating or a change to your periods, then please see a doctor.\nHow to treat endo belly?\nTo treat endo belly, you should firstly make sure you have a formal diagnosis of endometriosis and get treated for the condition. If you’re not sure where to start, ask one of the Lowdown doctors.\nTraditional treatment of endometriosis includes:\n\nHormonal therapy including with contraceptives\nMedications to block the oestrogen which drives endometriosis\nSurgery including laparoscopy or hysterectomy\n\nEndometriosis bloating relief\nWe know that holistic treatment is very powerful to treat endo belly symptoms including:\n\nReducing stress. The amount of stress you are under correlates to how severe your endometriosis symptoms are.[6]\nPelvic health physiotherapy. Endometriosis pain can cause your pelvic floor and lower abdominal muscles to tense up. Relaxing these muscles can help to ease your pain.[7]\nSleeping well, as good sleep reduces stress….see the first bullet point.\nRegular exercise has been reported to improve endometriosis pain by patients but the research is yet to catch up.[8] Movements and exercise can also help move the air around your abdomen to improve the bloating in endo belly.\nDietary changes. Although high quality research is lacking in how diet affects endometriosis symptoms, many people believe an anti-inflammatory diet can help. Avoiding foods which cause bloating such as beans, sprouts and dairy could reduce endo belly – why not try tracking what you eat and see if you notice a difference?\n\nIf you found this useful, please leave your own endometriosis experience so we can help plug the gaps in research and help others at The Lowdown.\n\n\n",

        "Content": "\nGeneral Endometriosis FAQs\nWhat is endometriosis?\nEndometriosis is a common health condition, which affects 1 in 10 women of child bearing age. That’s 1.5 million people in the UK and 190 million worldwide.\nIn endometriosis, cells similar to those usually found in the lining of the womb, grow in other parts of the body. These are called “endometrial deposits” and they can be found on the ovaries, bladder, bowels, pelvic and abdominal walls and in rare cases, even places like the lining of the lung.\nAs your body moves through its natural menstrual cycle, the womb lining thickens to create a nice home for a potential fertilised egg, before shedding and bleeding if no pregnancy occurs.\n\nThe symptoms of endometriosis are caused by these endometrial cell deposits outside the womb responding to your menstrual cycle in the same way – thickening and then bleeding.\nAs this occurs in places where there is less space for the cells to thicken, and nowhere for blood to escape, this causes pain, chronic inflammation and scar tissue (also known as adhesions). This contributes to the wide range of symptoms people with endometriosis may suffer from.\nWhat causes endometriosis?\nThere is no easy answer for what causes endometriosis. It is very frustrating for every endometriosis sufferer and those of us who treat it….that we don’t exactly know how, or why the condition happens. There are theories, but nothing has been scientifically proven. \nOne theory called “Retrograde Menstruation” suggests that during a period some of the womb lining travels the wrong way up the fallopian tubes and ends up depositing in the pelvis or abdomen. \nAnother called “Metaplasia” suggests that some cells in the body are able to change to cells found in the womb lining in response to inflammation or certain toxins. \nWe have seen some research that shows endometriosis can run in families and there could be a genetic factor. However, none of these have been proven and the real cause could perhaps be a combination of many different ideas. At The Lowdown, we’re hoping science can help us out and finally come up with an answer!\nWhen does endometriosis usually occur, and can you get it at an older age?\nEndometriosis affects 1 in 10, which is a staggering 190 million women and those assigned female at birth worldwide. However, it’s really difficult to understand more about when people present with symptoms or “get” endometriosis. This is firstly, because symptoms can vary so much. Some people get very severe symptoms with minimal endometrial deposits and others get almost no symptoms with widespread endometriosis….and we don’t know why. Secondly, because it takes an average of 7.5 years of symptoms before a diagnosis, we often can’t pinpoint when the endometrial deposits first started to appear. What we do know is that endometriosis can present at all ages from when you start your periods and in some, can continue until the menopause.\n\nWhat are the main symptoms of endometriosis?\nThere are up to 20 symptoms of endometriosis. The symptoms are really variable for each person, and not necessarily related to how severe or how many endometrial deposits there are. Symptoms can also be very vague and overlap with other common problems such as IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) or pelvic infections.\nThe signs that to look out for include the following:\n\nPainful periods which start from 1 to 2 days before bleeding and continue throughout the bleed. The pain can often be debilitating, meaning women miss school, university or work regularly during their period\nHeavy periods, long periods, spotting in between periods or losing old, dark blood before your period starts\nPain deep within your pelvis or abdomen during sex or internal medical examinations\nPain or bleeding when going to the toilet (bladder or bowels) while on your period\nDifficulty getting pregnant. Although it is important to remember that 70% of women with endometriosis fall pregnant naturally\nFatigue, lethargy and mood changes which are understandable when you read through the symptoms above!\n\nHow is endometriosis diagnosed?\nThe average time it takes for a woman to receive a definitive diagnosis of endometriosis is 7.5 years from when symptoms begin. We completely understand this leaves women feeling fed up, exhausted and perhaps even losing trust with the healthcare system.\nThe length of time it takes to diagnose endometriosis could be partly due to the symptoms, which can be vague and similar to other common conditions, but also because there is no simple test. \nImaging techniques such as an MRI scan or ultrasound of the pelvis can sometimes show endometriosis, but they are currently not perfect. A gynaecologist called Mathew Leonardi has our full respect for developing an advanced ultrasound technique which can accurately diagnose and stage endometriosis alongside helping to plan surgical treatment, however, very few people are trained in this technique at the moment, but we’re hoping it is more accessible soon.\nThe “gold standard” for diagnosing endometriosis is via a laparoscopy. This is a small key hole operation in which a camera is inserted into the abdomen and pelvis to look for endometrial deposits. If these are found, they may be treated at the same time.\nHowever, this procedure does involve risks. You will require a general anaesthetic and abdominal surgery is invasive with risks including pain, infection, bleeding and damage to organs such as the bladder or bowel walls. Most women are so fed up with their symptoms they are happy to take these risks for a diagnosis, other women prefer to try treatment options first. This is a personal decision, and I’d advise you to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of both options with your doctor.\nThere is ongoing research into potential biomarkers (such as blood tests or urine tests) that can be used to make a diagnosis instead of surgery, but that won’t be seen in reality for several more years.\nHow do I speak to a doctor about endometriosis?\nThis is a really frustrating time, and we know that those who suffer with awful periods often have to see their doctor multiple times before starting investigations. Concentrate on how your symptoms are impacting your life. If you are unable to work, or do your normal daily activities during your periods, especially if simple painkillers like paracetamol and ibuprofen don’t help, then this really signifies a problem. We have a blog on how to discuss endometriosis pain and how it feels with your doctor. Use this as a framework to start a discussion with your doctor, and state “I am worried that I have endometriosis” so your doctor knows how they can use their time to help you.\nCan you get pregnant with endometriosis?\nYes, you can get pregnant with endometriosis! Endometriosis can affect fertility and it also depends on the severity of your condition. Of couples trying to conceive naturally most (60 to 70%) will get pregnant within 1 year of trying, compared to 84% of couples where endometriosis is not an issue. 75% of people with mild endometriosis will conceive within 1 year. 50% of people with moderate endometriosis and 25% with severe endometriosis will conceive within one year of trying.\nUse our handy fertility quiz to help you understand more about how to optimise your fertility.\n\nIf you have a known condition that could cause fertility problems such as endometriosis, you can often be referred to specialist fertility services sooner than waiting for one year of trying. Speak to your doctor who can advise you further and explain what services are available to you locally. \nWhat is the difference between adenomyosis and endometriosis?\nAdenomyosis is where the tissue from the lining of the womb grows into the muscle around the womb. Endometriosis is where tissue from the lining of the womb is found outside the womb. Both conditions can cause very painful and heavy periods. Both conditions can be found alone, or together in the same person. They are often lumped together as one, but they are distinct conditions with different causes and treatments.\nWhere does the blood go when endo tissue starts bleeding during my period?\nWhen endometrial tissue in the pelvic cavity bleeds during the monthly cycle, it can’t leave your body through your vagina, like a normal period would. This tissue and blood can develop into cysts on the ovaries called an endometrioma, also known as a chocolate cyst. In other parts of the pelvis, the blood causes inflammation in the surrounding areas as it is reabsorbed which can cause a build up of scar tissue and pelvic pain.\nWhere can endometriosis occur and where does it occur in most cases?\nThe overwhelming majority of endometrial deposits are found in the pelvis, with most being on the ovaries followed by the fallopian tubes and ligaments which hold up the womb. Superficial endometrial deposits are often found on the lining of the pelvic cavity which is called the peritoneum. It is less common for endometrial deposits to be found on the bowel and vagina, and it is very rare for endometriosis to be found outside the pelvis, for example, in the chest.\nWhat’s the difference between dark and light endometriosis tissue?\nEndometrial tissue can have various appearances. They have been described as red, white, clear or black like “powder-burns” or “gunshot” marks. There is no difference between these tissues, it is just how endometriosis shows up in each individual. The skill and experience of your clinician will determine how easily they can identify the different types of tissue by sight. Sometimes, taking a small biopsy may be useful to look at the tissues under a microscope to confirm endometriosis.\nIs there ongoing research or promising developments in the treatment of endometriosis?\nYes! Menstrual disorders are named in the UK Government’s Women’s Health Strategy as a priority area to improve care and the World Health Organisation are “partnering with multiple stakeholders, including academic institutions, non-state actors and other organizations that are actively involved in research to identify effective models of endometriosis prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and care”. This hopefully means continued investment into research and more support for those who suffer from endometriosis. One of the most exciting areas of research is into diagnosis of endometriosis. As we know, a formal diagnosis often requires invasive surgery, which is not ideal. Research into specific bio markers like blood tests and urine tests to diagnose endometriosis is ongoing. The development of advanced ultrasound techniques is really exciting. Professionals who can use the advanced technique are more able to diagnose endometriosis on ultrasound alone and we hope more practitioners can access this high quality training soon so it is available worldwide.\n\nEndometriosis symptom FAQs\nWhat does endometriosis pain feel like?\nEndometriosis pain may be felt as burning, stabbing, pressure-like, cramping, throbbing or any other description of pain found in a thesaurus. Pain is subjective meaning people feel it in individual ways. We have collected descriptions about how other people describe endometriosis pain and how to speak to your doctor about endometriosis pain in our blog.\nCan endometriosis cause infertility?\nIf endometriosis is left untreated, it can cause infertility in some sufferers. However, we still don’t fully understand how it all works. Endometrial deposits can cause adhesions (scar tissue) where pelvic organs become stuck together through inflammation which may affect ovulation or the movement of the egg. Endometriosis on the ovary can cause cysts called endometriomas which can also affect the ability to get pregnant. Learn more about endometriosis and fertility in our deep dive blog.\nUp to 50% of women who are being investigated in fertility clinics are found to have endometriosis, and for many of them struggling to get pregnant is their only symptom.\nJust because you have a diagnosis of endometriosis does NOT mean you can’t conceive naturally. We do know that most couples (60 to 70%) will get pregnant within 1 year of trying to conceive, compared to 84% of couples where endometriosis is not an issue. \nFYI, our CEO Alice has endometriosis and conceived her first baby naturally after an ectopic pregnancy, you can follow her story here.\nDoes endometriosis affect the development of a child during pregnancy?\nEndometriosis can have a small increased risk of miscarriage in the 1st trimester of a pregnancy. Those with endometriosis can also have an increased risk of an ectopic pregnancy compared to women without endometriosis. \nEndometriosis does not affect the development of a child, but may increase the risk of complications during pregnancy (such as gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, placenta praevia and preterm labour). However, the research into these complications is of low quality so can’t be relied upon and guidelines don’t suggest that anyone pregnant with endometriosis needs additional monitoring.\n\nCan endometriosis cause weight gain?\nEndometriosis can cause some women to gain weight, but the causes are complex and there is little research into the association between weight and endometriosis.\nEndometriosis itself can cause bloating and water retention can look like weight gain on the scales. Not only this, but also treatments for endometriosis such as hormonal treatment may cause fluid retention, bloating and in some women weight gain. \nEndometriosis affects all aspects of your life, and with chronic pain, it may become harder to exercise and make healthier food choices (we all know chocolate and carbs are quick fixes for those low moments). Therefore, weight gain could be a by-product of living with a chronic condition. However, don’t worry, with effective treatment of your symptoms and addressing lifestyle changes, you can find a balance which allows you to maintain a steady weight. Our pelvic health physio Kathryn is also an endometriosis coach and a perfect person to speak to for motivation and support with these lifestyle changes and concerns about weight gain.\nCan endometriosis cause cancer?\nCan endometriosis cause cancer is a really common concern that research has been addressing. There seems to be a very small associated increased risk of ovarian, breast and thyroid cancer, but this risk is exceptionally small when you compare it to the risk of these cancers in the general population.\nSurgical treatment to remove all the endometriosis that can be seen on ovaries, can reduce the risk of ovarian cancer.\nCurrently, guidelines state that people with endometriosis can be reassured about cancer risk and not to worry. European guidelines recommend that women with endometriosis should concentrate on reducing cancer risks – aka eat healthily, avoid sunbeds, stop smoking, exercise and maintain a healthy weight – which is the same advice given to the general population.\nWhat are the bowel symptoms of endometriosis?\nThe bowel symptoms of endometriosis can be very similar to irritable bowel syndrome. These include bloating, constipation, diarrhoea or abdominal pain that can change throughout your menstrual cycle. However, some symptoms are more typical for endometriosis especially if you also have very painful periods. These include deep pain inside your pelvis during sex, pain on opening your bowels in your rectum or anus or even bleeding when you open your bowels. These are mostly felt during your period, but you may experience them throughout the month.\nWhat are the long-term complications or effects of untreated endometriosis?\nEndometriosis can cause heavy or prolonged bleeding, if untreated, this can lead to anaemia and symptoms of dizziness, fatigue and shortness of breath. Untreated endometriosis can cause chronic pain which can affect your quality of life. Untreated endometriosis may reduce fertility if left untreated, but fertility treatment can often help you get pregnant. We should never forget the impact of endometriosis and its symptoms on your mental health, relationships, working life and sexual wellbeing – which for many people are the most longstanding features when dealing with the condition for a long time.\nEndometriosis treatment FAQs\nHow can you help endometriosis pain?\nEndometriosis can be one of the most severe pains you will experience. You can concentrate on one way to help, or many different ways added together which often results in better overall relief.\nTreatment options include:\n\nSimple painkillers (ie paracetamol and ibuprofen) are a good place to start, but may not fully help. Stronger painkillers are available from your doctor such as strong anti-inflammatories. Medications such as mefenamic acid and tranexamic acid can help with heavy bleeding alongside pain.\nHormonal treatment is a very effective treatment for symptoms. This can include hormonal contraceptives (which can be prescribed by your GP), or hormonal injections to turn off your menstrual cycle called gonadotrophin releasing hormone agonists (these are only available from hospital specialists). One of the most effective hormonal contraceptives for endometriosis is the hormonal coil, but this blog can help you choose the best contraceptive for endometriosis, by discussing all the pros and cons.\nSurgical procedures are an important treatment for endo where endometrial deposits in the pelvis can be cut or burned away and any scar tissue that has formed can be removed. \nSimple non-invasive gadgets, such as a TENS machine (our favourite is Myoovi) can be used alongside painkillers, are non-invasive and have few side effects but can be expensive to purchase…(The Lowdown has a discount link available!) \nThe humble hot water bottle is one of our community’s favourites!\nPelvic physiotherapy is an incredible way to ease pain…seriously they are like magicians…and many women’s health physios, including our fabulous Kathryn, have specialist interests in endometriosis.\nSupplements can be beneficial, and the nutrients found in complexes such as Wild Nutrition’s Endo Support can help overcome symptoms such as tiredness and fatigue. \nComplementary therapies – never underestimate the power of a healthy lifestyle, diet and exercise for helping to relieve pain and improve your mood. Some women also find treatments including acupuncture, reflexology and homeopathy helpful\n\nWhat contraception is best for endometriosis?\nHormonal contraceptives are an important part of treatment for endometriosis. The best contraception for endometriosis is the one that suits you the best. Research shows that hormonal contraceptives can reduce pain and symptoms from endo, but you also need to balance their use against any side effects and your medical history. We have taken a deep dive into this in our blog about the best contraceptive for endometriosis. A really excellent place to start deciding, would be using our contraception recommender which can suggest options that are safe for you and help with your symptoms.\n\nAre there any natural treatments for endometriosis? \nThere are many natural treatments for endometriosis and we know from research that at least 70% of endo sufferers use alternative therapies to help their symptoms. However, research doesn’t yet help us much to decide which natural treatments are best and more of it needs to be done! Some studies suggest that exercise, physiotherapy and acupuncture can be useful for women with endometriosis – and we think it’s definitely worth a try.\nStudies suggest that diet and nutrition plays a role in endometriosis and symptoms, but there’s no clear evidence from them yet. We do know that vitamin D supplementation may help as well as ensuring you have a good intake of unsaturated fats, omega-3 and fibre.\nOverall, maintaining a healthy body and mind is exceptionally important when dealing with a chronic condition like endometriosis, and if any natural treatments can help you with this, go for it.\nWhat is endometriosis surgery?\nEndometriosis surgery is when a surgical procedure is used to remove endometrial deposits from inside the pelvis. The type of surgery is usually a laparoscopy which is the medical term for a camera procedure or key hole surgery. A diagnostic laparoscopy is when a camera is inserted through a small incision in your abdomen into the pelvis to look for the signs of endometriosis and give a diagnosis. During this procedure, you will be under a general anaesthetic. While this procedure is to provide a diagnosis, you can also have treatment for endometriosis at the same time. \nTypes of surgical treatment of endometriosis:\n\nAblation surgery is where endometrial deposits are burned away.\nExcision surgery is where endometrial deposits are cut away. Research suggests that excision surgery is a better option than ablation to reduce endometriosis associated pain, especially for deep endometriosis. However, excision surgery for deep endometriosis should be performed in a centre of expertise.\nCystectomy surgery removes ovarian cysts caused by endometriosis which are called endometriomas or chocolate cysts. Cystectomy is preferred to treat ovarian cysts rather than draining them, as they are less likely to return if you remove them completely.\nNerve surgery includes either ablation or removal of certain nerves in the pelvis with the aim to improve endometriosis associated pain. Ablation of the nerves is not recommended as it doesn’t seem to improve pain any more than removing the endometrial deposits alone. Removal of the nerves could improve pain but only when an expert performs the procedure and there may be long term complications such as constipation and urinary urgency.\nHysterectomy is the removal of the womb and is not a standard treatment for endometriosis. Hysterectomy may sometimes be performed as part of a larger operation to remove deep endometriosis or alongside removing parts of the bowel.\n\nCan endometriosis grow back after surgery?\nEndometriosis can recur after surgical treatment. The rates of recurrence vary massively in research studies from between 0% to 89%….which isn’t particularly helpful.  It’s hard to predict who will have recurrence of their symptoms after surgery, but research suggests that recurrence is more common if you have surgery at a younger age, have a strong family history of endometriosis or have adhesions (scar tissue) seen during the procedure. European endometriosis guidelines recommend that after surgery, hormonal treatment with the combined pill or hormonal coil should be offered for 18 to 24 months to prevent endometriosis associated period pain from recurring. \nHow can I find a specialist in endometriosis?\nAt The Lowdown, we strongly believe that everyone should be entitled to the same level of treatment and care.\nEveryone in the UK has access to free treatment on the NHS and this should be equitable and of the same quality. The NHS has accredited endometriosis centres, you can find your nearest using this website. If you are unhappy with the treatment you are currently receiving, you have a right to ask for a second opinion, and you have a right to choose where you are referred to for specialist treatment.\nIf you are elsewhere in the world and your healthcare is insurance based – check to see what is covered. Even if you are not able to access a laparoscopy, you can still access treatment using hormonal contraceptives and medications which are more readily available.\nDo I need treatment or can endometriosis stop developing and not grow further?\nEndometriosis is a mysterious disease. We still don’t fully know the cause, although there are theories. We know that in some people, endometriosis can stop developing and even regress. We do not know how to predict whose condition will regress or stop or how long it will take. However, if endometriosis is allowed to become severe it can cause debilitating and painful symptoms and have long term effects and impact fertility, so you may want to consider treatment rather than waiting to see what happens.\n\n",

        "Title": "The Lowdown&#8217;s March Newsletter",
        "Content": "\n\nHi everyone, Alice from The Lowdown here \nI’ve been back at the helm for three months now, and I have to say how much I’m buzzing by what The Lowdown have been working on.\nWe’ve closed a fundraise AND launched a new HRT review platform — read on for more info.\nThis month’s newsletter is sponsored by a pretty awesome female-founded healthcare company called Maxwellia. They focus on taking prescription drugs and making them available over the counter so we can get hold of them quicker and easier in pharmacies. We met their Founder & CEO Anna last year, and she was unanimously declared as ‘a vibe’, so we’re really excited to feature them.\nThings we learnt this month… \n\nReminder: You can get hold of the contraceptive pill from your local pharmacy \nAt the end of last year, the news broke that you’ll be able to get contraceptive pills prescribed for free by local pharmacists, instead of having to get a prescription from your GP. It’s such great news, but I’ve been speaking to a lot of NHS bigwigs since coming back from maternity leave, and they’re telling me that this change is going to take some time to roll out across the country — probably around 1-2 years.\nLuckily, it’s currently really easy to pick up a progestogen-only pill from your local pharmacy, and with the summer holidays just around the corner, we think it’s important to make more women aware of this if they’re running out of supply and need to make a mad dash to Boots.\nThe mini pill Lovima contains desogestrel, one of the most commonly prescribed ingredients in a contraceptive pill and is stocked in a range of pharmacies including Boots and Superdrug. You can pick up a pack for just under a tenner, for one month’s supply, once you answer a few quick suitability questions inside the pharmacy. So if you’re not able to get your usual desogestrel pill from your GP or clinic, it’s a pretty accessible option.\nWe’ve also just added the LoviOne morning after pill to our website — so if you’ve used this brand of levonorgestrel-based emergency contraception before, please share your review!\nIf you’re curious to learn more about how the mini pill works, one of our OG blogs has everything you need to know.\n\nSponsored by Maxwellia. Lovima® 75mcg film-coated tablets. Desogestrel. Oral contraception. LoviOne 1.5mg tablet.  Levonorgestrel. Emergency contraception. Always read the label.\n\nWhat we know so far from our perimenopause experiences & HRT reviews \nOur new menopause experiences and HRT reviews launched this week, here’s what our early insights are telling us…\n  The age range of experiences spans from below 40 and up to 70 years old. We’ve spoken to a few women under 40 who feel frustrated about their symptoms not being taken seriously, so hopefully this space will be validating for them (as well as the blog below )\n  The most common problems being reported are sleep issues and mental exhaustion. As a new mum, I feel for them!\n It’s a pretty even split between people who have and haven’t used HRT to help manage their symptoms. Oestrogen-only HRT methods have been the most reviewed, with Oestrogel 0.06% gel being the most reviewed of this type of HRT.\n 53% of HRT reviewers said it’s had a somewhat positive impact on their mood, 44% gained weight, 31% experienced no change to their sex drive, and 21% said their skin improved. Everyone’s different, so check out the reviews for the details!\nIf you’ve been considering talking to a healthcare professional about your symptoms, Dr Fran has written a great guide to preparing for your first perimenopause appointment — with two pieces of advice that may appear conflicting but are vitally important.\n\n\nSome new research has come out on the risk of brain tumours and the progestogen in the contraceptive injection \nA recent study looked at a group of people who had surgery for a type of brain tumour called a meningioma and compared them to another very similar group without. Meningioma is an uncommon and usually benign tumour. It’s not cancerous but can cause other problems by pressing on brain tissue and so can require surgery. It’s very rare under the age of 35, however the risk increases as you get older, with most people diagnosed over the age of 65.\nPrevious studies have found a small increased risk of meningioma requiring surgery in people who had used the synthetic progestogens cyproterone acetate (which is in the combined pill Dianette) and nomogestrel acetate (in the combined pill Zoely). People with meningioma should not use these contraceptives, although meningioma is very rare in young women, and guidance suggests users of the combined pill switch to an alternative method at the age of 50 as the risks tend to outweigh the benefits beyond this age.\nThis study however also suggested a link between the risk of meningioma and the prolonged use of medroxyprogesterone acetate, the progestogen in the contraceptive injections Depo Provera and Sayana Press. Our friends at the FSRH have suggested that clinicians should include this new info in conversations around risk and benefits of contraception with patients and will be monitoring the evidence around progestogen use and risk of meningioma.\n\nIn the news… \n NHS England has appointed its first-ever national clinical director for women’s health! Dr Sue Mann will be helping to implement the Women’s Health Strategy alongside supporting the roll out of women’s health hubs across England.\n BBC Sport studied elite athletes’ use of and attitudes to hormonal contraceptives. Looking into the pill’s perceived impact on their performance and menstrual cycle. If someone doesn’t conduct some women-specific sports science research soon, we might have to step in!\n Opill became the first over-the-counter birth control pill to be available without a prescription in the US in March. American Progress’ think-pieceexplores why this is such a pivotal moment, and what the next steps are to ensure the US has ongoing contraception care and reproductive rights for all.\n “Ozempic-babies” was not a term on my 2024 bingo card, but some women who are taking the weight-loss drug have reportedly found it easier to get pregnant — or on the flip side, think that it impacted the effectiveness of their birth control.\n️ Abortion has officially been decriminalised in every state and territory in Australia! Western Australia (WA) was the last state to still include abortion access in its criminal code. Which brings me to…\n\nGet involved: Decriminalising abortion in England and Wales \nUK MPs are proposing to decriminalise abortion up to 24 weeks in England and Wales. The latest proposal, supported by MPs across parties, seeks to protect anyone who has an abortion, and the medical staff who provide them, from prosecution.\nMSI Choices have made it super easy for you to get involved and help make abortion access a legal right. Find and write to your MP in just a few clicks using this pre-written message on their website \nPost of the month\n\nDid you know that technically, menopause is only one day in your life? Once you’ve watched the above, check out Dr Fran’s follow-up video \n\nIf you made it to the end, thanks for reading! I’m really excited about this new stage of The Lowdown. If you have any feedback on our new perimenopause and HRT areas, I’d love to hear it.\nI’ve also recently published my second Substack post on the highs and lows of returning to work after maternity leave. You can subscribe to my personal newsletter if you want more content on what it’s like to be a female founder figuring out work, life, and motherhood.\nThanks,\n\n\n",

        "Title": "The Lowdown&#8217;s February Newsletter",
        "Content": "\n\nHi everyone, Alice from The Lowdown here \nThis month, our newsletter is sponsored by our friends at NHS England as part of HPV Awareness Day, which was on Monday 4th March.\nIf you’re an OG newsletter subscriber, you’ll know that we’ve worked with the NHS before on the COVID-19 vaccine and cervical screening campaigns. We love how involved you all get when we work with them — and I’m really excited that we’re continuing to help the NHS with their next project.\nThings we learnt this month… \n\nThe NHS wants to hear your thoughts on the HPV vaccine \nThe Lowdown has partnered with the NHS for HPV Awareness Day on a 5 minute survey that aims to understand widespread attitudes and knowledge of HPV (Human Papillomavirus).\nThe NHS has set the ambition to eliminate cervical cancer by 2040, which means ensuring as many people as possible are being vaccinated against HPV, while also coming forward for cervical screening. This survey will help the NHS gain a better understanding of how people feel about HPV and how people think it works.\nIt’s open to anyone who lives in England, but we’d especially like to hear from parents and young women. Whether you know lots about HPV or nothing at all, we’d love for you to have your say and pass it on in your group chats \nThis is your chance to tell the NHS what you want to know about HPV!\n\n\nMenopause symptoms can be debilitating, but filling the knowledge gap could help us feel prepared \nRecent research showed that one in 10 women had left their jobs due to menopause symptoms. Now, new guidance from the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) says employers must make “reasonable adjustments” for anyone going through menopause whose symptoms are impacting their day-to-day activities, in a bid to tackle discrimination.\nA 2022 survey showed that 60% of women didn’t feel prepared for perimenopause, and over 90% hadn’t been taught about it at school. So, is it any wonder that so many of us find it difficult to carry on as normal when anxiety, mood swings, and brain fog take over? If we’ve never been taught what to expect, how could we prepare for it? Can you guess what I’m about to say next? \nA new perimenopause experience area has just dropped on our website. Hit the link below to so you (or your mum) can share your experience!\n\n\n\n\nAre we all really “coming off the pill”? \nSomething I get asked a lot in interviews is what I make of the ‘growing trend’ of women coming off the pill. I’m always a bit perplexed by this and ask the journalist, “What reliable data do we have that women are actually doing this?” Sure, anecdotally women like me are trying different options, but I’m careful not to overstate or sensationalise things without data.\nA couple of weeks ago, The Times shared data suggesting that many people have been moving away from the pill in the past 10 years (find it here if you don’t subscribe). This graph is a bit misleading, as it’s only using data collected from sexual health clinics. The UK has closed 26% of its sexual health clinics in the last 3 years. Given every method in that data is dropping in prescribing, isn’t this showing that the lack of funding is impacting contraceptive prescribing overall?\nThe data also doesn’t include prescriptions filled out by GPs, which we know make up around 80% of contraception prescribing in the UK. So it really is just one part of a larger story.\nIf you are curious about coming off the pill (or whether you need to take a break from contraception at all), we’ve got a blog for that.\n\n\nIn the news… \n We’ve been gripped by this fascinating article in the British Medical Journalon corporations using feminist language to push products or tests that aren’t always 100% evidence-based.\n Two of the largest pharmacies in the US will start to sell the abortion pill, Mifepristone, over the counter. This feels like a win after the countless horror stories post Roe vs. Wade. There’s also more Mifepristone research on the horizon about its use as a non-hormonal contraceptive, FYI.\n In positive endometriosis news (yes, really), a new medication, called Ryeqo, has been approved for use in Australia to treat moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis.\n\nBookmark to read, listen and get involved… \n If you missed the Mythbusting Contraception panel talk we hosted with The Pantry Underwear at the end of last year, you can now listen to it as a podcast. Check it out here or search ‘changing room chats’ on your preferred podcast app.\n Sign Reproductive Justice Initiative’s Clap Back on the Contraceptive Patchcampaign to call for there to be more skin tones of the patch available — there’s currently only one!\n Friend of The Lowdown (and our fave feminist pole dancer), Tara Margulies, is starting a new online community called Understand Your Cycle, for all things periods and taboo topics.\nPost of the month\n\nDr Fran takes on Elon Musk \n\nAs always, thanks so much for reading our newsletter, and if you have anything you’d like to share or ask us, I’d love to hear it.\nDon’t forget to subscribe to my personal newsletter if you want more updates from me — I recently published my first post on 7 things I learnt running a startup while pregnant.\nThanks,\n\n\n",

        "Title": "The Lowdown&#8217;s January Newsletter",
        "Content": "\n\nHi, it’s Alice from The Lowdown here \nI’m back from maternity leave, and immensely grateful for the safe arrival of my son Alexander. He arrived three days after my birthday, after an exhilarating 4.5 hour labour, which felt like doing the biggest, most intense poo of my life.\nNaturally, I have SO much to say about pregnancy, birth, breastfeeding and the fourth trimester, but I’m well aware that unless you’re interested, or in that stage of life, it’s not the most thrilling read…\nSo I’m setting up a newsletter where I share my personal experiences on all this stuff — and the reality of being a new mum and long-suffering CEO. Subscribe here to get more personal updates from me.\nIn the meantime, here’s the latest in women’s health news and research from us!\nThe lack of info on how medical research works is stopping lots of women from taking part \nThe results from our attitudes to health research survey are in! Thank you to everyone who took part, 572 people shared their thoughts with us on what they’d like to see more research on in women’s health, and I’ve really enjoyed reading through your answers.\nLuckily for The Lowdown, 65% of you want to learn more about the gaps in women’s health research, so I’m not out of a job. A third of respondents had already participated in some sort of research themselves (mainly surveys), while 75% had considered taking part in research, and 80% agreed that they’d love to participate but have questions about how it all works. Enter: The Lowdown. We’ll be creating an FAQ blog explaining everything you need to know about clinical and medical research.\nOverwhelmingly, the top reason for wanting to participate in research was to help improve healthcare for the next generation, followed by having healthcare that’s as good as men, and third, a desire to make research more diverse overall. Menopause and perimenopause, mental health, and endometriosis took the top spots for the kind of research most people want to learn about.\nDo you agree? Or think something crucial has been missed out here. You can still share your thoughts with us, just hit the link below to take part.\n\n\nYou can join a groundbreaking research study for postnatal depression \nPostpartum depression is something so many of my friends and fellow mums have experienced. The sadness and fatigue can seem endless, and it’s heartbreaking that so many are struggling and having difficulty bonding with their baby. That’s why I’m really pleased to share that we’re joining forces with researchers in the UK who are working on a new treatment for this condition.\nLindus Health are looking for women who are, or think they might be, currently suffering from postnatal depression and who have given birth in the last 12 months. The study takes one week to complete over five in-person visits to their research centre in London, with compensation provided. If you think you or a friend may be interested, tap on the link below for more details.\n\n\nA new symptom of PCOS has been studied… and it’s probably not what you think \nThis newly published study into Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — get the lowdown on our blog if you’re not sure what PCOS is — has been all over my Google alerts. This research says that along with symptoms like hair growth (or loss), acne, and infertility, PCOS can also be linked to memory problems and faster brain ageing in midlife. 907 women aged between 18 and 30 took part in the study over 30 years (!), being tested on their memory, verbal abilities, processing speed and attention. Researchers found that those with PCOS had lower scores overall on 3 out of 5 tests. It’s wild how a gynaecological condition can impact your brain health\nPCOS affects 1 in 10 women, and we’d love to publish a report on what we’ve found to be the most common experiences of Lowdowners with PCOS. We’re on our way to 200 experiences, so if you or anyone you know has PCOS I’d love it if you could contribute.\n\n\nIt’s not always easy to tell which health products are legit and which ones are pure marketing \nWe speak to women every week who talk to us about the products they’re using to manage health conditions, hormones, or other things to help their health. On top of this, our community often ask for our opinion on certain products to help them make a decision that’s not a waste of time or money. So, we did what we had to do.\nThis month we launched the first independent review platform just for women’s health products! If, like me, you’re a hardcore reviews hunter before buying literally anything — especially when it comes to health — I hope you’ll be as excited about it as I am. We give you the real lowdown on what’s in these products, plus any science to back them, and you share your honest opinion alongside, just like our contraception review pages.\nI wanted to share one of the first reviews we got for the cycle and ovulation tracker, Ovusense because it’s a genuine heart warmer (especially as a new mum myself). You can read more reviews across products for fertility, periods, endometriosis, PCOS, perimenopause, and more on our homepage by selecting ‘Products’ from the navigation menu.\n\nIn the news… \n Our friends at the FSRH have called for the morning after pill to be more easily accessible and reclassified so it could be bought in shops. Back in 2019 the RCOG also recommended that the morning after pill should be sold off the shelf alongside pregnancy tests and condoms. I’d love to know what you think about this! Drop us a DM @get.the.lowdown\n I went to the Women’s Health Summit this month and asked what (I reckon) most of us there were also wondering… Why is abortion barely mentioned in the Government’s Women’s Health Strategy? Check out Glamour UK’s piece on this major oversight.\n The latest development in male contraception, the ADAM ‘hydrogel’ contraceptive, has set social media ablaze this month. The gel is injected into the vas deferens tubes (note: WITH local anaesthesia ) to block sperm from travelling through them. If you’re curious about premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), a severe form of PMS, this article on being diagnosed in your 30s is eye-opening. It also mentions our Dr Mel’s work on creating much-needed short-form info for doctors on PMDD!\n\nBookmark these to read, listen and visit…\n Get the kettle on and have a look at our resident researcher and clinical lead, Dr Becky’s finalised research report from her PhD: Understanding access to Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare in the General Practice setting; A focus on inequality.\n I was on Fournine’s podcast Tea At Four and had So. Much. Fun. Busting contraception myths never gets old, and I will not rest until everyone knows that you don’t have to take your 7-day pill break.\n If you’re stuck for plans this Wednesday 7th Feb, take an evening trip to the Vagina Museum to see Dr Mel, Nurse Simphiwe, and Kate Muir discuss all things contraception and ask a few questions of your own.\nPost of the month\n\nWe wish we didn’t have to make these Blue Monday posts, but until the Government starts spending more on women than they do on potholes, you know where to find us.\n\nI’m so excited to get back to the monthly newsletter, thanks for reading and if you have anything you’d like to share with us or questions on what we’re up to, I’d love to hear it.\nA quick reminder to subscribe to my personal newsletter if you want more updates from me.\nThanks,\n\n\n",

        "Title": "What are the best treatments for endometriosis?",
        "Content": "\nWhat is endometriosis?\nEndometriosis is more than just a “painful period”, it’s a chronic condition. Endometriosis symptoms involve the whole body and as a chronic illness can have a significant impact on your life both physically and mentally. Painful periods are not normal, especially if they mean you need multiple days off from school or work, or interfere with your daily activities. Unfortunately there is still no general consensus on what causes endometriosis, but let’s take a look at some of the treatments.\n👀If you think you’ll enjoy this blog, make sure to check out our newsletter for more:\n\nHow long does it take to get diagnosed with endometriosis, and what happens after you do?\nOnce you get an endometriosis diagnosis, it’s important to treat it to avoid long term health effects. Untreated endometriosis can cause fertility problems, financial difficulties and mental health issues, but research has shown that it can take on average 8 years to be diagnosed, so it’s important to seek help to manage symptoms.\nWhat treatments are available?\nNon-hormonal\nLifestyle\nHighest rated by Lowdown users, the humble hot water bottle is the best non-hormonal option for symptom management, followed by exercise and other lifestyle changes such as an anti-inflammatory diet. This aims to reduce sugar and salt intake, increase fibre, vegetables and fruits, and includes healthy unsaturated fats like olive oil and oily fish\nMedication\nWe find that many of the Lowdown community get relief from medications such as paracetamol, codeine and anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen or naproxen. They don’t come without potential side-effects though. So whilst they may be helpful, if they no longer work for you then taking more than recommended doses is likely to be bad for your health. In this instance, seek advice from your doctor about other options you could try.\nHormonal\nContraception is another popular method of endometriosis symptom management among Lowdown users. This has the added advantage of potentially slowing down the progression of the disease. \nOptions include progestogen-only methods such as the hormonal coil (IUS), the injections and some pills. Combined hormonal methods such as the combined pill, patch and vaginal ring can also be helpful. Not every option is appropriate for everyone though, so it’s a good idea to check our contraception recommender tool or talk through your options with a Lowdown doctor to see which may be the best one for you.\n\nChemical Menopause Treatments\nFor severe cases, gynaecologists may opt to give treatments called GnRH analogues. These suppress the feedback cycle between the brain and ovaries and stop production of the hormones produced by the ovary. This has the unfortunate side effect of causing menopausal symptoms and if used for longer than 6 months, can cause loss of bone density. It’s not an ideal long term solution, but can be helpful in planning next steps.\nSurgery\nSome endometriosis can be burned away during keyhole surgery, but bigger clumps of cells will need surgical removal by cutting it out. Because there is a risk of damage to other organs during the surgery this needs to be done by a highly skilled endometriosis surgeon. Total removal of the ovaries and womb can also provide relief for some women, but the hormones oestrogen and progesterone in the form of combined hormone replacement therapy (HRT) will need to be provided long term to avoid the symptoms and health consequences of menopause caused by the surgery.\nOther alternatives\nUsers of The Lowdown endometriosis review platform mentioned a few other options that may be worth exploring:\nCBD tampons \nWhile there isn’t any published data to back up the use of CBD-infused tampons, some women do get relief from period cramp pain. CBD is similar to what causes a “high” by smoking weed (THC) but it doesn’t cause this high. Instead, it has anti-inflammatory properties that are meant to help pain. Everyone responds differently, so it’s hard to say if it will help without trying it yourself.\nTENS machine\nThis is a device that is stuck onto the skin in the areas where pain is felt. It sends little electrical impulses to the area which helps pain. It does it by confusing the “signal” that is sent up to the brain and a tingling feeling is felt on the skin. Again, there isn’t a great deal of evidence for its effectiveness, but you might want to try it to see if it works for you. We recommend using Myoovi. \nAcupuncture/Massage/Osteopathy/Mindfulness\nRelaxation techniques can be really helpful in managing endometriosis symptoms. A calm body and mind can help you to cope with the pain. While there isn’t much evidence that it definitely helps, anything that works for you to help reduce your stress levels is good in our books!\nHow The Lowdown’s new endo platform can help users find support\nYou don’t have to feel alone! The Lowdown’s endometriosis experience platform is here to support you. You can read endometriosis experiences from other uses and also share your endometriosis experience too.\n\nWhat The Lowdown’s docs can do to help\nOur doctors at The Lowdown can talk through your symptoms and work out what the best treatments, especially contraception-treatments might be for you. It can be helpful to talk through your experience with a doctor so you know what to ask for and what to say when you see your own GP so you’re set up for the next steps.\nGot more questions about endometriosis? We got you\n\n",

        "Title": "How to tell which type of PCOS you have",
        "Content": "\nThe basics of PCOS\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common condition affecting up to 26% of women and AFAB folk1. It is a hormonal imbalance that causes  “hyperandrogenism”, meaning there is more testosterone (a typically male hormone) in the blood than usual…..which causes PCOS symptoms that can be frustrating, such as acne, excess hair growth on the body, oily skin, hair loss from the scalp and weight gain. Your ovaries may not release an egg each month, which can cause irregular or missed periods. But everyone’s experience of PCOS is different… leading to the idea of different PCOS types.\nWhy are there different types? What causes them?\nRather than thinking of these as separate types of PCOS, we should think of them more as different expressions of the same condition; hyperandrogenism. Remember, not everyones’ experience of PCOS is exactly the same, and how it is managed may vary depending on the different types. Knowing what the causes, symptoms and side effects are, may help you to understand your type of PCOS so you can best manage it. \n\nThe four types of PCOS according to mainstream medicine\nDepending on what resource you read, you may find different classifications for the types of PCOS. The criteria healthcare professionals use to diagnose PCOS also vary, but the bottom line is that androgen excess is implicated in some way. At The Lowdown, we suspect the title PCOS will disappear in years to come and be replaced by names for each type (you read it here first).\nRather than calling the condition PCOS (which doesn’t describe someone’s symptoms  specifically enough), the consensus from research says that it’s better to break PCOS down into what symptoms are experienced. These are broken down by medics into “phenotypes” which is a word to describe how our genetic blueprint is expressed in the world\nPhenotype A – Full PCOS\nThis person has the combination of hyperandrogenism, ovary dysfunction (irregular or no periods) and polycystic ovaries on a scan, in other words, has the “classic” type of PCOS described in textbooks.\nPhenotype B – Non-polycystic ovary PCOS\nThis means that an individual has the effects of hyperandrogenism, and their ovaries are impacted. Weight gain, hirsutism, acne, difficulty getting pregnant and irregular periods would be symptoms for this person. But their ovaries are not polycystic on an ultrasound scan.\nPhenotype C – Ovulatory PCOS\nIn this situation, a person has symptoms of hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovaries (seen on scan), but they don’t have ovarian dysfunction, meaning that trying to conceive is easier and periods are more regular.\nPhenotype D – Non-hyperandrogenic PCOS   \nFor this person, the ovaries look polycystic and they don’t function properly, but they don’t have the symptoms of hyperandrogenism.\n\n\n\n\nPhenotype\nAndrogen Excess (acne, hair growth, weight gain)\nPolycystic ovaries seen on ultrasound scan\nDysfunction of ovulation (irregular or no periods, difficulty conceiving)\n\n\n\nAFull PCOS syndrome\n\n✓\n✓\n✓\n\n\n\nBNon-PCO PCOS\n\n✓\n \n✓\n\n\n\nCOvulatory PCOS\n\n✓\n✓\n \n\n\n\nDNon-hyperandrogenic PCOS\n\n \n✓\n✓\n\n\n\n\nThe four types of PCOS – according to alternative medicine\nThere are four different types of PCOS which are explained in functional (or alternative) medicine circles. These types have not been as robustly researched by mainstream medicine, but they attempt to break down the mechanisms behind why PCOS develops. It may help you to know what discussions are taking place when you come to do further research for yourself.\nInsulin-resistant PCOS\nThis affects the entire body and is classically what we would associate with textbook PCOS (phenotype A above). Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas and is released when we eat. Insulin signals to the cells of the body to use sugar or store it in the liver or as fat so we can use it later. In insulin-resistant PCOS, over time, the cells of the body have a poorer response to the insulin signals. The levels of insulin therefore need to get higher and higher to store sugar, so sugar remains in the bloodstream and can affect your health in the long term with an increased risk of diabetes and heart disease. To keep this at bay, many people with PCOS find lowering sugar or simple carbohydrates in their diet can help symptoms and overall health.\nInsulin resistance also leads to high levels of circulating androgens in the body and produces the symptoms of PCOS such as weight gain, acne, hirsutism and hair loss on the scalp.\nNot everyone will have insulin resistance as part of their PCOS experience. Some of the signs that suggest you may have insulin resistance are:\n\nyou have gained a lot of weight and your periods have reduced/changed\nyou’re struggling to conceive\nyou have a family history of diabetes\nyou have had pregnancy-induced diabetes\nyou have all the classic symptoms of hyperandrogenism as described above.\n\nInflammatory PCOS\nChronic inflammation can be another route to developing PCOS. Stress, inflammatory diets (such as highly processed foods high in saturated fat, refined sugar and flour), environmental toxins and family genetics can all play a role in developing this.\nThe chronic inflammation is thought to impact on how the ovaries function, leading to the classic hyperandrogenic symptoms and irregular periods. We’re not sure how inflammation directly impacts the ovaries, though.\nPost-pill PCOS\nMany people worry that being on the pill causes polycystic ovary syndrome but we want to reassure you that this is not the case. PCOS cannot be caused by the pill, but as the pill treats PCOS symptoms, PCOS is often not diagnosed until you stop taking the pill. Periods can take a few months to return after stopping (sometimes up to 6 months), but it isn’t necessarily due to PCOS.\nIf more than 6 months have gone by and your period hasn’t returned, speak to a doctor at The Lowdown, or your own healthcare provider for advice. \nAdrenal PCOS\nThis type of polycystic ovary syndrome is related to raised DHEA levels – an androgen hormone produced by the adrenal gland which sits above your kidneys. One study tested the adrenal function of 38 patients with PCOS and found that 15 of them produced more adrenal hormones than would be considered normal10. No one really knows why this happens yet, but stress is implicated. More studies are needed to find out why.\nHow can you tell which PCOS type you have?\nTalking to a doctor to consider further investigations like blood tests and an ultrasound scan can help to pinpoint the classical medical phenotype of PCOS you have. It can be hard to tell which type of functional medicine PCOS you have because each type ultimately leads to similar sets of symptoms – nutritionists, dieticians or functional medics could help more with this.\nAre there different ways to manage the types of PCOS?\nIt doesn’t really matter what type of PCOS you have, what matters is how you look after yourself going forward. You should try to keep an eye on your periods, your heart and circulation health, stress levels, your weight, and your diet.\nIt’s important to seek regular input from a healthcare professional to manage your PCOS in the best way possible, as PCOS can affect your long term health. If you don’t have many periods, you may need some medication to help protect your womb lining from overgrowing and you should be having yearly checks for diabetes, cholesterol levels, blood pressure and overall health. You might be able to seek support for weight loss if needed and get help when trying to conceive\nWe understand that you may struggle to find answers, which is why you can read PCOS experiences to learn from and connect with others who have been through it on The Lowdown.\nWhen should you talk to your doctor? \nIf you have any concerns about PCOS, start talking to a doctor early. Tracking your symptoms is a great place to start and opens up an easier conversation. It can help to record your periods for 3 months and see if you can spot any patterns in your cycle. While you are having tests for PCOS (which may include blood tests or an ultrasound), you can discuss the type of PCOS you may have with your doctor. Although remember, current medical treatment of all types of PCOS is still the same. To find out about effective treatments and to ask questions of our other community members, you can read PCOS experiences. And don’t forget to share your PCOS experience too to help others in the future. \n\n\n\n",

        "Content": "\n✔️If you think this blog sounds informative, make sure to check out our newsletter for more:\n\nWhat is PCOS? How many people have it?\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is common. In fact, according to the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), it is thought to affect between 2 and 26 in 100 women, depending on the diagnostic criteria used. \nShockingly, 70% of people remain undiagnosed. \nPCOS is essentially a hormonal imbalance. The ovaries don’t release an egg each month, so it often causes skipped periods. The body is also in a hyper-androgenic state, which means there is more testosterone in the blood than usual which can lead to acne, hair growth on the body, oily skin, hair loss from the scalp and weight gain.\nPeople with PCOS can experience difficulty conceiving and if the hormonal imbalance worsens over time, longer term problems can occur such as diabetes and womb cancer.\n\nWhat causes PCOS? The lowdown on androgens\nThe cause of PCOS is still not known, but in order to diagnose the condition, 2 of 3 criteria need to be met (The Rotterdam Criteria):\n\nBlood tests that show androgen (testosterone) excess and/or symptoms of this such as excess body or facial hair growth (hirsutism) \nIrregular periods;\nPolycystic ovaries on ultrasound;\n\nHyperandrogenism (androgen excess) is thought to be the main reason why PCOS happens. It acts on the ovaries to prevent ovulation and the effects on the rest of the body cause symptoms such as acne, oily skin, scalp hair loss and hirsutism.\nEven though testosterone is thought of as a male hormone, women actually produce 3-4 times more testosterone than oestrogen in the body. But we’re still talking about small amounts in the blood by comparison to a man. It doesn’t take a lot extra in the blood to shift the balance towards an androgen excess.\nDoes it cause any other health risks or issues?\nLongterm, PCOS is linked to heart and circulatory disease, high cholesterol, fatty liver, diabetes and infertility. Having PCOS doesn’t necessarily mean that any of these problems will develop, but it is something that needs to be kept in mind and monitored.\nWomb cancer is a potential long term risk with PCOS. The main risk is caused by not having regular periods. This can be mitigated by either being on long term contraception, or every 12 weeks, having a progestogen medication to bring on a period. This is mainly for people who have very sporadic periods. Not having a period with PCOS may seem to be a good thing, but the effect of not having a bleed every month is what can lead to cancer.\nPCOS can also impact on future pregnancies with increased risks of premature delivery or miscarriage, diabetes and high blood pressure in pregnancy.\n\nMain symptoms of PCOS \nMany people with PCOS struggle with irregular periods, tiredness, fatigue, bloating and acne. Other features of hyperandrogenism include hair loss from the scalp, hair growth on the face and body, and weight gain, especially around the middle.\nLowdown users also reported symptoms like high sugar cravings, patches of dark skin pigmentation and difficulty getting pregnant.\nHow can you tell if you have PCOS \nNot everyone can tell they have PCOS based on their symptoms alone. If you have possible symptoms of PCOS such as irregular periods, the most important thing to do is have a blood test which is looking for signs of hyperandrogenism in the blood. A pelvic ultrasound to look for polycystic ovaries is another way PCOS can be identified, but remember you need 2 out of 3 Rotterdam criteria, so polycystic ovaries on their own are not enough to make a diagnosis of PCOS.\nTalking to a healthcare professional about PCOS \nBefore seeing a GP, it’s a good idea to come prepared. Start tracking your periods so you know when they happen. Don’t forget to add on symptoms you are experiencing, such as light bleeding, heavy bleeding, cramps, mood swings, acne etc.\nOnce you’ve done this for 3 months or more, arrange to speak to a GP. This way, when you are asked about your symptoms, you have a solid amount of information about your symptoms that you can share.\nApps can be helpful for this, and some will even allow you to print out a report to show your GP. \nHow can our telemed service help ahead of going to the GP?\nThe Lowdown doctors can give you time to talk about your symptoms. They can then offer suggestions for symptom control, including hormonal treatments, or point you in the direction of helpful resources or how to get the help you need from your GP.\nWhat happens after you get diagnosed?\nLots of people who leave their PCOS experiences on The Lowdown say they’re left in the dark after getting their diagnosis, or told to come back to their GP when they want to get pregnant. But this shouldn’t be the end of your care.\nEveryone with PCOS needs:\n\nAnnual blood checks for diabetes, cholesterol and blood pressure\nEndometrial (womb lining) protection – either with contraception, like the combined pill or hormonal coil which keeps the lining of the womb thin, or by having a withdrawal bleed brought on by taking progesterone pills every 3 months (if periods are very irregular)\nA support network such as The Lowdown: read PCOS experiences and share your PCOS experience or a charity such as Verity.\nTo maintain a healthy weight, regular exercise and a balanced diet high in unsaturated fat and fibre, stop smoking, and reduce alcohol intake.\n\nFor those trying to conceive:\n\nReferral to a fertility specialist early to discuss options such as medication (metformin, clomid) or interventions (ovarian drilling, IVF)\n\nFor those who are pregnant:\n\nEnsure that your midwife is fully aware of your PCOS diagnosis so you can have a gestational diabetes check. This is a type of diabetes that develops when pregnant and generally goes away when the pregnancy ends.\n\nWhile PCOS isn’t curable, it can be managed. Don’t be afraid to access help and support if you need it. Early diagnosis means earlier intervention to keep you healthy for the long term.\n\nGot more questions about PCOS? We got you\n\n",

        "Title": "Anxious, exhausted and struggling to focus? It could be perimenopause",
        "Content": "\nDid you know that up to 69% of us are likely to struggle with anxiety or depression at some point in our menopause transition¹? Yet, in research undertaken in the UK in 2021, only 12% of us associated anxiety with menopause?²\nAnxiety appears to be an early symptom of perimenopause, hitting many of us in our late 30s and early 40s, sometimes even before your periods change.\nIt’s the canary in the mine that marks a subtle shift in our hormones and is often accompanied by challenges with cognitive function (aka brain fog) and sleep. Researchers believe that these ‘cluster symptoms’ show up together as a result of the complex interplay between our hormones. I like to think of hormones as an orchestra with over 100 different instruments split into sections. When one section, or even one instrument, is offbeat or out of tune, the whole melody is impacted.\nWith anxiety, it is likely that it impacts us as our progesterone levels reduce. Progesterone helps to modulate the GABA system in our brain, which is known to impact mood and our ability to achieve rest. In addition, studies have shown that oestrogen production, which also fluctuates and declines across our menopause transition, is linked to our serotonin or ‘happy hormone’ levels too.³\nA poor night’s sleep can lead to an increase in cortisol production (a stress hormone)⁴, which is why we may start to find ourselves waking up feeling wired or jittery. Cortisol surges and chronic stress prevents serotonin production⁵, which, amongst a whole raft of associated symptoms and behaviours, affects mood. Poor or disrupted sleep, regardless of hormone fluctuations, impacts our brain’s ability to function optimally and hits our energy levels too. \nFinally, testosterone is likely to be declining. Although associated with desire, this clever hormone is also, in part, responsible for our ‘get up and go’ or ‘drive’. When we have less, our energy levels are naturally depleted.\n\nA toolkit for tackling anxiety in midlife\nIt’s natural to feel frustrated by our bodies in midlife. But our biochemistry is phenomenal and, with the right tools and support, it can be a positive opportunity to rethink how we nourish our bodies and minds. Here are our top tips for tackling anxiety, mood and the energy roller coaster holistically:\n\nMake your GP your friend: We tend to leave speaking to our doctor until the point we’re on our knees. But, if you talk and share how you’re feeling early, not only do you have a clear sense of what medical interventions may be of help, you also have the opportunity to evaluate if you have the right partner for your midlife health, and the time to seek a second opinion should you need. Evidence indicates that Hormone Replacement Therapy may improve mood and anxiety⁶.\nConsider how you digest stress: Our hormones are impacted by external influences⁷ as well as biochemical changes. And menopause often happens at a stage in our lives when we’re juggling multiple life challenges. From ageing parents to growing kids. From climbing that career ladder to rethinking what you may want to do next. There is good evidence supporting the impact of breathwork and regular meditation practice in calming our nervous system. Emotional Freedom Technique (also known as tapping) has a growing body of research supporting its potential too.\nLook at what you put on your plate: Avoid high-sugar foods, processed food and refined carbs – all of which can push up insulin⁸, which can cause inflammation in the brain and alter neurotransmitters and mood.\nSupercharge your nutrition with well-researched herbal heroes: It’s very exciting at this moment in time that the herbs, spices and botanicals used for centuries in traditional medicine practices are finally getting the research investment they need to better quantify their impact. There are so many plants that can support mood, rest, energy and focus.\n\nAshwagandha, one of the best-researched adaptogens⁹, has been shown to impact our stress response, reduce anxiety and improve sleep.\nCurcumin, the primary bioactive substance in Turmeric, has been shown to have a positive impact on mood partially through its ability to modulate the neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine¹⁰. Poorly absorbed on its own, it is best taken with piperine, a Black Pepper extract known to increase its bioavailability.\nLemon Balm¹¹ is a gentle herb with strong traditional use and can be easily grown in a window box and taken as a tea. Clinical research shows that it can reduce mild-to-moderate anxiety as well as sleep disturbances. Research shows it can also improve mood. \n\n\nMake movement a priority: We’re all familiar with the ‘fight or flight’ response and the gear shift our bodies automatically make when they feel threatened. Research shows that movement has a very real impact on our cortisol levels¹² – and, depending on the practice we choose, can help settle our bodies back in ‘rest and digest’ too. The best form of exercise is the form you’ll actually do! But in menopause, it may be that you need to listen in to your body a little. If you suddenly find yourself feeling depleted rather than energised following a regime that has previously served you well, consider exploring new forms of movement too.\n\n\nTo find out more about MPowder’s whole body and mind philosophy for midlife, check out their online journal of blogs.

Just because herbs are ‘natural’, doesn’t mean they are safe for you. It’s important to do your homework, and to be conscious of both potential contraindications with medication or existing health conditions and to adhere to any recommended time frames for use.\n✔️If you think this blog sounds informative, make sure to check out our newsletter for more:\n\nLangade, D. et al.

        "Title": "What is endometriosis?",
        "Content": "\n✔️If you think this blog sounds informative, make sure to check out our newsletter for more:\n\nWhat is endometriosis? How many people have it?\nThere are an estimated 190 million women and people assigned female at birth (AFAB) around the world affected by endometriosis (about 5-10% of those in their reproductive years).\nThe jury is still out on what causes endometriosis, but what we do know is that endometriosis causes clumps of cells to form outside of the womb that resemble the ones found inside the lining of the womb. These clumps bleed in the same way that the womb lining does, but the difference is the blood hasn’t got a place to escape from, so it stays behind, usually in the pelvis, and causes scarring, and more often than not, debilitating pain.\nOver time, these clumps get bigger and can get stuck on other organs such as the bowel, bladder, ovaries and the surface of the womb.\nBecause diagnosis is difficult and often requires surgery, it can take many years to be diagnosed with endometriosis. A 2024 report by Endometriosis UK found that it takes on average 8 years and 10 months in England and Scotland to be diagnosed. Sadly, many people feel gaslighted by medical professionals who imply that their period pain is “normal”, which is also another reason why diagnosis can take so long. \nWhat causes it?\nThere are a few theories on what causes endometriosis…\nRetrograde Menstruation\nFor many years, the main theory, called “retrograde menstruation” attempted to explain that endometriosis starts because period blood travels up through the uterine (fallopian) tubes rather than out of the body through the cervix. It makes sense, but not for endometriosis, which can rarely be found in other places around the body such as the lungs and brain! Retrograde menstruation is thought to occur normally in up to 90% of women, so why doesn’t everyone develop endometriosis? Endometriosis is also found in newborns, prepubertal girls and men, so this simple explanation can’t be the full story.\nMetaplasia\nThe coelomic (se-lo-mic) metaplasia theory says that endometriosis is caused when a trigger stimulates cells within the body to change from their normal function and structure, into cells similar to those found in the womb. It’s not a perfect theory though, because it doesn’t explain all the types of endometriosis such as that found in unborn foetuses.\nHormones and environmental toxins\nThis theory suggests that oestrogen causes growth of the endometriosis cells which are less reactive to progesterone, the hormone that normally keeps the lining of the womb in check. It is also thought that some environmental toxins mimic oestrogen and this causes further overgrowth of the endometriosis cells.\nOxidative stress and inflammation with apoptosis suppression\nThis theory says that DNA damage leads to an inflammatory response which encourages the overgrowth of endometriosis cells. Couple this with another theory that these cells don’t respond to the usual signals to breakdown when they are past their sell-by-date (known as apoptosis) and you have a potential recipe for endometriosis.\nImmune dysfunction\nIt has been noted that autoimmune disorders are more common in women with endometriosis, so this has led to the theory that the immune system doesn’t function properly and this leads to endometriosis.\nGenetics\nThere unfortunately isn’t one gene that is thought to be linked to endometriosis, but it does run in families, so genetics are thought to play a role in this condition too.\nStem cells\nStem cells are cells that normally turn into more mature cells in the body. They are the ultimate building block! They change into the cells needed after being triggered by chemical reactions in the body. A stem cell destined to become a stomach cell for example wouldn’t suddenly grow on your toe because it wouldn’t receive a signal to do that on your toe. There is a theory that stem cells lead to endometriosis cells because they don’t receive the correct signal to grow into the cell it is supposed to be. This explains why endometriosis can be found all over the body, and not just in the area near the womb.\nThe lowdown…It’s complicated\nAll these theories are interconnected, and all of them may be connected in some way. More research continues, so hopefully all of this knowledge will one day translate into better treatments and diagnostic methods. \nWhat are the symptoms of endometriosis?\nPeriods\nThere are multiple symptoms of endometriosis, it isn’t just period pain. Periods can become heavy and bleeding could happen in between periods too, which looks like old or brown blood. Period pain can be felt in the anus, down the thighs and in the lower back. It can start in the days before a period begins and go on until the period finishes or even a few days after. Some people feel pain all the time, but it usually gets worse around the time of a period.\nBody-function\nMany women describe bloating, headaches and fatigue caused by endometriosis. As well as brain fog and difficulty making decisions which can make life feel even more stressful.\nUrine and bowel symptoms\nGoing to the toilet to pass urine or stools can be painful and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is common. Sometimes there can be blood in the urine or the stools if the bladder or bowel is involved.\nSex\nSex can be painful and the pain is usually felt deep inside the pelvis. \nMental Health\nConstant pain takes its toll. Women with endometriosis are more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety, as being in pain can make it hard to want to socialise with others who just don’t understand what you’re going through.\nEveryday Life\nIt goes without saying that when faced with all of the above symptoms, daily life can feel tough. Endometriosis can even take a toll on your finances. Missed working days and the need to take on fewer hours to cope can all play a part, not to mention all the extra purchases like pain relief and supplements. Pain thresholds can be much higher in women with endometriosis, so they may need stronger pain relief than the average person for the same effect.\nStages of Endometriosis\nWhen endometriosis is diagnosed, it’s categorised into 1 of 4 stages. This staging system was created by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM).\n\n\n\n\n\nStage/Classification\n\n\nASRM\n\n\n\n\n1 – minimal\n\n\n1-5 spots of endometriosis found, not deep\n\n\n\n\n2 – mild\n\n\n6-15 spots of endometriosis, starting to get deeper spots\n\n\n\n\n3 – moderate\n\n\n16-40 spots of endometriosis, many deep spots, small ovarian cysts, scarring\n\n\n\n\n4 – severe\n\n\n>40 spots of endometriosis, many deep spots, large ovarian cysts, severe scarring\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can you tell if you have endometriosis?\nUnfortunately, there isn’t a way you can know for sure if you have endometriosis until you have surgery (called a laparoscopy). This is done with a keyhole camera. Ultrasound scans can help, but unless the sonographer is highly experienced, it is unlikely to be seen on ultrasound unless it is very severe and obvious, so having a normal ultrasound scan does not rule out endometriosis. \nMRI scans tend to be used once the keyhole surgery has identified endometriosis but it can be used before surgery to guide the next steps. MRI is used to determine where the endometriosis is and which organs are affected.\n\nDoes it cause any other health risks?\nEndometriosis can cause issues with fertility. The more severe the stage of endometriosis, the more likely it will be harder to get pregnant. There are no absolutes though. The severity of endometriosis on appearance doesn’t always correlate to how hard or easy it is to get pregnant.\nTalking to a healthcare professional about endometriosis\nKeeping a diary of your periods and other symptoms is really helpful. Tracking how often you get symptoms, how severe they are, and how long they last for is exactly the kind of information you can share with your doctor during a consultation. It reduces the need for you to have to remember facts or dates and you can concentrate on getting your point across. Plus, it helps them to decide on the next steps, whether that’s monitoring your symptoms for longer, or referring you to another health care professional for further investigation.\nWhen you are referred to a gynaecologist, be sure to ask them about their experience with endometriosis and what the next steps are should endometriosis be found (or not). Don’t be afraid to seek a second opinion if you’re not satisfied with the answers you get.\nWhat can I do before going to my doctor?\nIt helps to discuss your symptoms so you can feel confident when seeing your GP. The Lowdown doctors can help you feel empowered to ask for a referral to a gynaecologist from your GP and can give you an idea of potential treatments.\nThe Lowdown doctors can also help you to decide on which contraception method is right for you should you be diagnosed with or have suspected endometriosis and choose to use contraception or discuss how to manage your symptoms.\nWhat happens after you get diagnosed with endometriosis?\nThe main thing is to manage your symptoms in whatever way works for you. If you’re not trying for a baby, contraception can help to improve pain and slow disease progression. Unfortunately, it isn’t curable, but contraception and treatment to manage symptoms can massively help.\nIf you’re trying to conceive, then discuss a fertility referral with your doctor.\nThere are several support groups you can join, including the Endometriosis UK charity. You can also read endometriosis experiences and share your endometriosis experience on The Lowdown!\n\n\nGot more questions about endometriosis? We’ve got you covered\n\n",

        "Content": "\nYou can now share your perimenopause experience and/or leave an HRT review on The Lowdown!\nShare and compare perimenopause experiences\n\nIf you’ve been following our journey over the past year, you may know that you can share your experience of endometriosis, PCOS, and fertility on The Lowdown. Now, that includes your experience of perimenopause!\nYou can share as much or as little information as you like about symptoms, treatments, and what’s helped or not worked for you. That includes treatments that aren’t HRT like diet, exercise, CBT, other medications, and more. Think about what you’d wish you’d known and want others to know. This perimenopause experience is a great example.\nHave a browse of all the experiences that have been shared so far. They’re insightful, they’re emotional, and they’re bloody helpful.\n\n\n \nSearch HRT reviews on The Lowdown, and leave your own\n\nThe HRT reviews work just like our contraception reviews. You’ll find medically reviewed information about a method of HRT, plus reviews left by women who have used it, all on the same page. You can browse all HRT reviews here, or search for a specific HRT method in our navigation bar. This HRT review and this one are a couple of great examples.\n\nWhy we did it\nSo you can make informed decisions about your health \nLike contraception, when you seek help from your GP for menopause you often have to do your own research on different solutions, like the type of HRT that might be best for you, complementary therapies, and other lifestyle changes. We are THE platform for you to do that research. You can find real perimenopause experiences alongside medical explanations of how different treatments work. Plus all the data in one place for you to review your HRT options.\nBecause we’re here the whole way \nWe want to be a helpful resource from your first period to your last. Being the OG contraception review site, it was a natural step for us to launch HRT reviews (in some cases, the two are related).\nOur doctors have created free resources on how to prepare for your first perimenopause appointment with your doctor, including a symptom checker to take with you.\nIt’s yet another space that needs more information — especially honesty about side effects \nFor some, HRT is life-changing, but just like contraception it can take a few to find one you like, and there’s not much information about the side effects of HRT. Especially which methods are the biggest culprits for certain side effects, and how to manage these effects at all. Some people try a method of HRT hoping it will be the magical cure for perimenopause symptoms, but the side effects can even make them feel worse! And what do you do if you can’t have HRT at all? \nWe’re here to fill this knowledge gap.\nPerimenopause is misunderstood and not recognised \nWe spoke to multiple women who said they were surprised to get menopausal symptoms while they’re still so young in their 40s, as they associate menopause with women in their 50s. Many also didn’t realise so many symptoms they experience were associated with perimenopause, or realised later on and wished they’d had that information available.\n\nThere’s a real lack of understanding around this stage of life, and the information that’s out there can be littered with lots of clinical terminology for healthcare professionals (our graph explaining your hormones during the perimenopausal stage got people talking).\nIt’s no surprise that perimenopause is so misunderstood. We weren’t taught about it at school, or even in later life. The symptoms can feel isolating, leaving you unsure who to talk to and feeling left to deal with it on your own. We’ll all go through this life stage, so why does no one really prepare us for it?\nWith the help of our medical team, we’re here to explain what it all means in an easy-to-understand way, answer your burning questions, and help you find the right treatments for you — just like we’ve always done.\nIt’s not all about drugs \nTo clarify, we’re not pushing HRT over other treatments. We’re a balanced platform, believing all women should have a right to choose what routes they take to manage their menopause symptoms. This is a very similar approach to what we’ve taken in contraception.\nHow do I leave my own review or experience? \n\nIt’s just one form to fill in, but it has two parts. The HRT section is optional, and you won’t fill this in if you select that you haven’t used HRT.\nAt the beginning of the form you are asked if you have used HRT. If yes, complete your HRT review first, then move on to your perimenopause experience.\nIf no, you go straight to the perimenopause part of the form.\n\n\nWhere will my submission go? \n\nYour perimenopause experience will live on our perimenopause experience hub.\nIf you complete a HRT review, it will show up on our HRT reviews area and on the individual HRT page for the method you left a review for, just like this one.\n\nWho’s this platform for? \n\nIf you’re perimenopausal or postmenopausal. Share your story whether it’s in the past, currently going through it, or if you suspect you’re beginning perimenopause.\nIf you’re not yet perimenopausal. We think it’s important to learn about perimenopause earlier in life, so we can be better prepared for when we go through it ourselves.\nIf someone you know is perimenopausal. Some women we spoke to said they’d like to share this with their family or colleagues to help them understand the myriad of symptoms and how if can affect you.\n\nSounds great, how can I share it? \n\nShare the form on WhatsApp with this link 💬\nCopy this link to the form and send it however you like 🔗\nSend this blog so they have the lowdown 📩 and ask them to tap the image below to share their experience 👇\n\n\nGot more questions about perimenopause? We got you covered\nAlice set up The Lowdown in 2019 with a mission to help transform the minefield that is  contraception. She’s spent the last four years talking to thousands of women about this problem – and leads on the delivery of our product, brand and overall proposition.\n",

        "Content": "\nThere are many stories about women not being listened to, or leaving the appointment unsatisfied. However, we know there are literally thousands of incredible healthcare professionals out there who are doing great things. \n✅. If you think you’ll find this blog helpful, make sure to check out our newsletter for more: \n\nHow do I know if I am in perimenopause?\nPerimenopause is a collection of multiple symptoms. Some women may experience nearly each and every symptom, others may only have a couple. 1 in 4 won’t get any symptoms at all! There are at least 34 symptoms of perimenopause, so it can be difficult to work out what’s going on.\nTwo pieces of advice that may appear conflicting but are vitally important…..\n\nLog and track your symptoms. Many women in perimenopause don’t realise because it’s hard to notice how all the changes happening to your body are related. There may not be any particular pattern as symptoms can come and go in varying intensities. Using a symptom tracker or diary can be a great place to start.\nDon’t put every symptom down to perimenopause. Some symptoms of perimenopause, such as palpitations and joint pain, can be signs of other medical problems. Please don’t ignore these if something just doesn’t feel right, flag these symptoms with your healthcare professional.\n\n\nWhen is it best to book an appointment? \nThis is a personal choice. You can book an appointment if you feel that symptoms are starting to affect your quality of life, or if you are interested in discussing treatment options such as medications or HRT. \nAs above, it is also really important that you book an appointment urgently if you develop symptoms that may be a sign of other medical problems, including change in bowel habit, weight loss and vaginal bleeding after sex or in between periods, please don’t put these simply down to perimenopause.\nWho shall I book in with?\nMany GP practices will have a professional who is more interested and experienced in women’s health or perimenopause and HRT. Ask the reception staff, they will know. You may find it is a slightly longer wait to see the right professional. But it is often worth it for a more thorough consultation where hopefully all your questions will be answered within the time slot.\nWhat should I know about for a perimenopause appointment?\nI would always advise doing some research before an appointment. You don’t need to become a medical expert, but having a brief understanding of what perimenopause is and what treatment options are available can help speed up an appointment.\nHowever, it is really crucial to do your research in the right place. At The Lowdown, all our information is medically reviewed and we try our best to answer the questions that our users are asking. Our perimenopause FAQs are a great place to start….and if you have any other questions you’d like us to answer, please get in touch on hello@thelowdown.com.\n\nWhat will a doctor ask about during your perimenopause appointment?\nFirstly, we want to know about your symptoms. This is where a symptom tracker is really important. We will want to know:\n\nWhat symptoms you have\nWhen they started\nHow they are affecting your life, work and relationships\nWhat are the most distressing symptoms for you – is it hot flushes, joint pain or libido?\n\nNext, and this is really important for doctors, we will check all your symptoms to make sure there is nothing worrying and screen for any other medical problems. If we are concerned about any symptoms, we may stop discussing perimenopause and concentrate on that for the rest of the appointment. \nThis can be confusing, and sometimes we might not explain ourselves well enough. If this happens with my patients, I am not dismissing your concerns about perimenopause, I am ensuring that I am not missing a more dangerous health problem such as cancer or heart disease. Doctors could arrange further investigations or tests at this point, BUT, this does not mean you can’t discuss perimenopause again. Please, book another appointment and we will help.\nAfter screening your symptoms, many doctors will also check your medical history and overall health. It’s a good opportunity for us to check your blood pressure, any recent bloods, BMI and if you are up to date with cervical and breast screening (as appropriate). Then we can move onto the next step!\n\nThen, we want to know what you would like to do with this appointment:\n\nDo you just want to confirm you’re in perimenopause?\nWould you like to start treatment today?\nWhat treatment are you most interested in or would you like us to explain each of them?\n\nNow we’ve been through all of these points, we need to check the time! If 10-15 minutes have already passed, I will often send a patient away with some “homework” or reading about their chosen treatment options. I will arrange a follow up appointment or phone call to agree on the treatment plan and prescribe it in the next 1 to 2 weeks. In an ideal world, this would all be done within one appointment, but often the NHS time constraints don’t allow it. By splitting the appointment into two, this ensures we can make sure everything is medically safe and get your diagnosis and treatment plan right first time.\nDo I need any more appointments?\nIf you have been started on HRT, we will review the type and dose of HRT after 3 months of use. This helps us to check if your symptoms are improving and identifies any side effects or issues. When you are happy and feel stable on an HRT regimen, you will have a check up every 12 months, which may be with a pharmacist or nurse, to screen for any problems, check your overall health and switch your regimen if needed.\nAre blood tests needed to diagnose perimenopause? Any other investigations needed?\nWomen often ask me for blood tests for perimenopause. However, they are not needed and don’t help with diagnosis of perimenopause.\nA hormone called FSH becomes high when a woman is postmenopausal (12 months after your periods have stopped). However, during perimenopause the FSH level can vary hugely up and down so isn’t a reliable test. We diagnose perimenopause based on your symptoms. \nThere are exceptions, however. In women with perimenopausal symptoms under the age of 40, and sometimes for women between the ages of 40 and 45, we will do an FSH test to support our clinical diagnosis.\nAdditionally, if you are over 50 years old and using the implant, hormonal coil or progestogen only pill (which can stop your periods), an FSH level can be checked. If it is raised then you can safely stop contraception after one more year. If the FSH level is in the premenopausal range you will be advised to continue contraception and have the level checked again in another year. Alternatively you can continue contraception until the age of 55 when we advise it is safe for most women to stop contraception, even if they are still having periods. No other investigations are needed for perimenopause. But I might organise other blood tests to rule out other medical problems such as arthritis, vitamin deficiency, thyroid problems or arrange an ECG heart tracing for palpitations. This is part of doctors being safe and ensuring we have checked everything out!\n\nWhat if my doctor doesn’t listen?\nHealthcare professionals are here to help, but we are human and don’t always get it right. I can remember certain days when I’ve been ill or stressed and I haven’t been the best doctor I can be. But we still are here to help and we want to. Yes, women’s health is still far behind where it should be, but there are thousands of healthcare professionals trying to fight for improvements.\nIf you feel that you have been dismissed or not had the appointment you were hoping for, you can always book in with another doctor for a second opinion. Failing that, you can switch GP practice and find another one!\nBe sure to have a look through our perimenopause and menopause experiences on our website too!\nGot more questions about perimenopause?

        "Content": "\nCan the contraceptive pill treat perimenopause symptoms?\n\nThe combined pill can be used to treat perimenopause symptoms\nThe progestogen only pill may help perimenopause symptoms in some, and is occasionally used as part of HRT\nOther contraceptives like the hormonal coil can be used in perimenopause as part of HRT and/or to treat bleeding symptoms\nYou still need to use contraception to prevent pregnancy during perimenopause!\n\nAs perimenopause usually starts in your mid 40s, people are often still using contraception – but can the contraception actually help with symptoms? Well, yes it can!\n\nDo I still need to use contraception in perimenopause?\nYes, you still need to use birth control in perimenopause. If you are under the age of 50, you are considered to be fertile until 2 years after your last period. If you are over 50, you are considered to be fertile for 1 year after your periods have finished. Sure, it might be very very unlikely you get pregnant, but we still need to be sure!\nIf you’re using contraception which has stopped your periods (for example, the hormonal coil, injection, implant or progestogen only pill), you can safely stop it after the age of 55.\nWe have loads more information specifically about contraception in the menopause in our blog.\n\nCan the contraceptive pill treat perimenopause symptoms?\nYes! The contraceptive pill can treat perimenopause symptoms. The combined contraceptive pill contains oestrogen. Perimenopause symptoms are caused by your body’s oestrogen levels fluctuating and falling, so by taking a consistent daily amount, this may help manage your symptoms. Combined contraception can also help manage the period symptoms of perimenopause by making bleeds lighter, shorter and more predictable.\nHowever, most combined contraceptive pills contain synthetic oestrogen, rather than the natural, body identical oestrogen in hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Synthetic oestrogen isn’t as good as HRT at providing bone protection to prevent osteoporosis. Combined hormonal contraception also may not be suitable for those with risk factors in their medical history and has to be stopped by the age of 50.\n\nWhich pill is best to treat perimenopause symptoms?\nThe best pill to treat perimenopause symptoms is whichever pill is safest and causes the fewest side effects, because then you’re more likely to take it! If the standard combined pills such as Rigevidon and Microgynon are working for you….then why change?\nHowever, as the standard pills contain synthetic oestrogen, they may not be the best choice for everyone in perimenopause. Some of the new combined pills such as Qlaira, Zoely and Drovelis contain a different form of oestrogen called estradiol which is identical to the one our bodies make – so called “body identical” oestrogen. This is the same type of oestrogen that’s found in HRT so could be better for perimenopausal symptoms. Qlaira is a pill that changes hormone levels throughout the month, whereas Zoely and Drovelis have the same level of hormones in each pill. They are both combined with different progestogens, so you may need to try these to see which suits you and your symptoms best.\nHow long can I take the pill for during perimenopause?\nYou can take the combined contraceptive pill until the age of 50. This is because beyond 50, the health risks of the combined pill such as the risk of a blood clot or stroke start to become greater. These risks are very small when you’re younger, but balanced against the risk of pregnancy (which is very unlikely over 50), these risks become slightly more significant. Don’t worry, you can change to an alternative form of contraception until you can stop at the age of 55. And for perimenopausal symptoms, there are a whole range of other ways to manage them, including lifestyle changes, supplements and HRT.\n\nCan any other contraceptives treat menopause?\nYes, other contraceptives are used to treat menopause, but usually not alone.\nThe desogestrel progestogen only pill (think Cerelle, Cerazette) can be used at a double dose (two tablets) as the progesterone part of HRT. An older type of progestogen only contraceptive called Noriday at a triple dose (3 tablets) has occasionally been used as part of HRT during times of drug shortages. However, these are off license and should only be done on the advice of a menopause specialist.\nThe hormonal coils Mirena, Levosert and Benilexa which provide contraception can also be used as the progesterone of HRT for up to 5 years, and they are a fabulous treatment for heavy bleeding that can come with perimenopause.\nIf you need support in choosing the right contraception, our comparison tool and contraception recommender are right on hand. And don’t forget we have a fantastic team of doctors who are all brilliant at managing both contraception and perimenopause, alongside our partner menopause specialists.\n\n\nGot more questions about perimenopause?

        "Content": "\nest-contraceptive-pill-perimenopause \nYou are likely to have heard about it one way or another – HRT is regularly in the media and everyone seems to have an opinion. Some people are HRT obsessives, others think it’s the devil. There are many conflicting articles and research studies around, but at The Lowdown we’re here to give you a balanced view on HRT as an individual.\nIf you have any other burning questions about perimenopause, we have tried to answer them all in our perimenopause-FAQs blog! If you think you’ll find this blog useful, sign up to our newsletter for loads more:\n\nWhat is HRT for perimenopause?\nHRT stands for hormone replacement therapy. It’s basically putting the hormones back in your body that are changing and reducing throughout perimenopause. The aim of HRT in perimenopause is to manage your symptoms and make you feel better.\nHow does HRT work?\nStandard HRT contains two hormones: oestrogen and progesterone. It’s the oestrogen which generally helps the symptoms of perimenopause. In perimenopause your oestrogen levels fluctuate up and down. These fluctuations cause many of the symptoms you hear about; like hot flushes, brain fog, irritability and mood changes. By replacing the oestrogen, it keeps these levels stable and hopefully improves symptoms. \nIf you have a uterus, oestrogen can cause the womb lining to overgrow and over time, this can increase your risk of cancer of the womb.\nSo, we use progesterone alongside the oestrogen in HRT to protect your womb from this. This is called “endometrial protection”. It’s really important that you use both the oestrogen and progesterone together if you have a uterus.\nSome people in perimenopause may also be prescribed testosterone, which is another hormone that can reduce during perimenopause and can contribute to low libido, mood change and brain fog.\nHow to choose HRT?\nHRT can be a minefield, just when you may have got contraception sorted, more hormones to deal with! Here is a handy step by step guide on how to choose.\n1. Do you have a womb? \nIf you have a womb then you will need both oestrogen and progestogen as part of your HRT. This is because taking oestrogen causes your womb lining to overgrow, over many years, this can increase the risk of cancer of the womb. Taking a progestogen alongside the oestrogen reduces this risk. If you have had a full hysterectomy, then you can take oestrogen only HRT. If you have had a subtotal hysterectomy, you may still require progesterone and should discuss this with your healthcare professional.\n2. Are you having periods or not? \nIf you have had a period within the last 12 months, you are usually recommended to start on cyclical (also called sequential) HRT, or, to get a hormonal coil. Cyclical HRT is where the progesterone part of HRT is only taken for part of each month (usually 10-16 days). Cyclical HRT can prevent irregular and annoying bleeding that is a common side effect of HRT. After 5 years of cyclical HRT, or when you hit the age of 54, you should be switched to continuous HRT. Continuous HRT is when the dose of progesterone remains the same throughout the month as is designed to prevent any bleeds. You can start on continuous HRT if you have no periods due to hormonal contraception, or it has been around 12 months since your last period.\n3. Consider your medical history\nIf you have previously had a blood clot or have risk factors for blood clots like smoking, family history or a high BMI, a form of oestrogen that is given through the skin (patch, gel or spray) is considered the safest option.\n4. Think about your lifestyle\nAre you someone who remembers to take things daily? Would you prefer something that needs minimal effort? Tablets, gels and sprays are taken daily, whereas patches only need to be changed twice a week and the hormonal coil can stay in for 5 years.\n5. How do you feel about breast cancer risk? \nThere are several forms of progesterone that are used in HRT. Some types of progesterone are associated with a very small increased risk of breast cancer. If you are worried about breast cancer risk, for example due to family history, then you could choose a progesterone which studies have shown does not change breast cancer risk over the first 5 years of use such as utrogestan or dydrogesterone.\n6. Do you want to take your oestrogen and progesterone together or split them up? \nTaking both hormones together in a combined patch or tablet is more convenient BUT splitting the hormones can make it easier to change the doses and tailor your regimen to you.\n\nSymptoms and side effects! \nSome perimenopausal symptoms can be better treated by different HRT types. And, as with all medications, side effects can happen. This is the real art of HRT which women’s health experts can help you navigate. Our medical team or partner menopause specialists are on hand to help.\nYou can use our perimenopause and HRT areas to research the varying types of HRT and see real life reviews and advice about how they have helped and affected other women.\n\nWhat’s the average age to start HRT?\nThe average age to start with perimenopausal symptoms is around 46. You can start HRT if you are experiencing perimenopausal symptoms, or wait until you feel ready. However, it is best to start HRT before the age of 60 and within 10 years of your last period, as this maximises the benefits. \nHow long can you be on HRT for?\nYou can be on HRT for as long as you need to. There is some controversy around this, as users were previously told to reduce and stop taking HRT after 5 years. This is partly due to the small increase in breast cancer risk with some types of HRT. However, nowadays, more and more specialists are suggesting that HRT can be continued for as long as needed.\nEach year, you should be invited to have an HRT review. During this, your healthcare professional will make sure that you are still using the correct HRT regimen for you, screen for any problems with side effects and make sure you are still aware of all the risks and benefits of your HRT regimen. If the risks start to outweigh the benefits you get from the HRT, then they may advise you to wean down or switch treatments.\nThe exception is vaginal oestrogen HRT, this can be started in elderly women and continued long term without ever needing to stop.\n\nIs body identical HRT better for perimenopause?\nBody identical HRT means that the hormones included are the same chemical make up as the hormones our body naturally produces. All HRT contains body identical oestrogen. However, the progesterone part can either be synthetic (not exactly the same as our body) or body identical. Body identical progesterones have been shown to have no increased breast cancer risk for at least 5 years of HRT use. Synthetic progestogens may be associated with a small increase in breast cancer risk but are usually better at preventing bleeding side effects. Body identical HRT is better for perimenopause only if it suits you and you have tolerable side effects, if not, synthetic HRT may be a better option for you!\nWhich HRT is best for low libido?\nHRT can often help improve low libido and manage menopausal symptoms. But we don’t know which regimen of oestrogen and progesterone is better to treat low libido yet as there is no research. By adding your experience to our perimenopause and HRT experience areas, you can help solve this question! Testosterone is an additional form of HRT which is licensed to be used for very low libido in perimenopause. Libido is very complex and there are often lots of factors which contribute, we have lots of tips about how to improve your libido from our sex coach Lucy.\nCan HRT be used with contraception or birth control?\nYes, HRT can be used alongside contraception, and in fact, some types of HRT also act as birth control! During perimenopause, you can still get pregnant so if you’re sexually active, it’s important to consider contraception too. We have more in depth information in our perimenopause and contraception blog.\nThe hormonal coils Mirena, Levosert and Benilexa which are progestogen only contraceptives can be used as part of HRT for up to 5 years. The desogestrel based progestogen only pill can also be used in a double dose as both the progesterone part of HRT and as contraception, however, this is usually only done under the care of a healthcare professional who is experienced in menopause treatment. \nHRT is an acceptable treatment option for perimenopause and loved by thousands of women. Make sure you understand all the risks and benefits, and use our experience area to do your research. If you want more individualised care, we have friendly menopause specialists to help!\nYou can also share your experience with perimenopause and menopause on our website, as well as search for any and all HRT reviews. \n\n",

        "Content": "\nWhen it comes to women’s health, we have a massive gender data gap on our hands. This means there’s a big difference in the quantity and quality of data that is collected and analysed on women and men. This includes things like whether we are more likely to get certain health conditions or react to medications differently. Women didn’t even have to be included in clinical trials until 1993¹, and the majority of medical research still relies on male mice². So it’s no wonder there’s a huge gap in women’s health research. It’s pretty dire.\nThe impact? It takes women longer to be diagnosed with diseases³, it means we’re less likely to be prescribed the right drugs⁴, and it means the majority of us (84% in fact) have felt dismissed by our GP⁵.\nThe Lowdown is on a mission to change that. We have a huge amount of insight into women’s real-world experiences of their health and the types of solutions we’re looking for. We partner with like-minded organisations to share our research into women’s health, so we can innovate better together and improve women’s health outcomes for everyone.\nWe do this because you told us you want to help. In a community survey we conducted in December 2023, 80% of Lowdown users told us they would either love to participate in research, or would like to, but have questions about how it works. And a whopping 62% of our community told us that the main reason they want to participate is so the next generation of women have better healthcare than we have now.\nWe couldn’t agree more. So here is an overview of the problems we’re trying to solve and how we work with partners to solve them:\nProblem: Women aren’t represented in health research \n\n⏭ The Lowdown work with innovators in women’s health, to gather insights on what women really want when it comes to their health\nWe do this by conducting research surveys and focus groups on behalf of partners. These will always be clearly labelled as ‘in partnership’ with our sponsoring partner. If you participate in this research, we will never share any personally identifiable information (like your name or email) with these partners. If you want to see an example of the types of reports we write, check out this report we created for the UK government on the Women’s Health Strategy in 2021.\nProblem: Healthcare innovators and public healthcare systems find it hard to reach and speak to women\n\n⏭ The Lowdown works with women’s health companies and public health organisations to spread the word when they launch new products, solutions and awareness campaigns, so our community can make more informed health decisions.\nWe do this by offering companies the opportunity to sponsor our events, newsletters or blogs, or social media channels. This content will always clearly be badged as ‘Sponsored by X’ or ‘Paid partnership with X’, and is always produced and reviewed by our medical team in line with our Content policy. Check out this example of a sponsored blog that we worked on with the digital contraceptive company, Natural Cycles.\nWe partner with healthcare providers to enable them to a provide a source of independent information, which is aligned to women’s needs for female health education and information on multiple treatment options. With all the partners we work with, the information provided to our audience is independent of those organisations and The Lowdown retains full editorial control.\nWe also work with organisations like the NHS to help raise awareness of public health campaigns and improve women’s health outcomes. This can range from running informative webinars and making content around topics like whether the COVID-19 jab can impact your menstrual cycle, to sharing tips on what to expect during your cervical screening.\nProblem: Women’s participation in clinical trials remains depressingly low\n\nA snippet from our email newsletter\nThe Lowdown works with partners to help recruit women directly into clinical trials and research studies\nClinical trials are an important step in getting a new drug or medical device into the market, but female participation remains low, especially when it comes to pregnant or breastfeeding women. Currently, women make up only 22% of Phase 1 clinical trial participants – and as recently as 2016, 70% of biomedical experiments did not include sex as a biological variable.⁶\nTo fill this gap, we work with companies that help to recruit women for clinical trials. We do this by promoting trials in our newsletter and on our social media that we think may be relevant to you, and give you the chance to find out more if you’re interested. If someone we refer to a trial ends up taking part, then we receive a fee for referring them. We also advise companies on how to improve the recruitment process for women and clinical trials to make it easier for you to take part, asking things like ‘have you thought about covering childcare costs?’ that a load of blokes sat around a boardroom might not think of…\nIf you have any questions or feedback for me and The Lowdown team, or if you are an organisation planning something exciting in the women’s health space and you want to work with us, don’t hesitate to get in touch by emailing hello@thelowdown.com\n\n",

        "Content": "\nGeneral perimenopause FAQs\nWhat is perimenopause?\nPerimenopause is the time during your life before menopause, it’s a natural change that we all go through. Natural menopause doesn’t happen overnight, and the hormonal changes leading up to it can happen over many years.\nDuring perimenopause, progesterone levels initially start to fall which often causes changes to your periods such as heavier or more irregular bleeds. Oestrogen levels fluctuate up and down at the same time while the ovaries are trying hard to release eggs despite there not being many left! Overall, your oestrogen levels slowly drop during the perimenopause.\n\n1 in 4 people won’t get any symptoms at all. However, you may experience a wide range of symptoms including anxiety, brain fog, poor sleep, hot flushes, headaches and symptoms similar to premenstrual syndrome (PMS) which can affect your quality of life.\nPerimenopause may last for several years with symptoms coming and going or becoming more and less intense until menopause is reached. You reach menopause when you have not had a period for 12 months.\nWhat’s the difference between perimenopause and menopause?\nPerimenopause means that you’re going through the changes towards menopause. Menopause is actually only one day in your life — the day when it’s been exactly 12 months since your last period. After this date, you are clinically described as being postmenopausal.\nThe symptoms felt during perimenopause are due to changes in your hormones. During perimenopause progesterone levels initially fall, which often causes changes to your periods and sleep pattern. As the number of eggs in your ovaries reduces, oestrogen levels fluctuate up and down, sometimes wildly, which can cause symptoms such as hot flushes, headaches and irritability. Your overall oestrogen and progesterone (alongside testosterone) levels gradually decrease until they reach a baseline level at menopause.\n\nAfter menopause, your baseline hormone levels are lower than during your reproductive years and can cause long-term symptoms such as vaginal dryness and itching, discomfort when urinating, and brain fog. Fun fact — “peri” means “around” in ancient Greek and “post” means “after” in Latin so that’s where these descriptions have come from!\nWhat age does perimenopause start?\nPerimenopause can start at different ages but usually begins in your mid-40s. Perimenopause lasts an average of 4 to 8 years before menopause. The average age of menopause in the UK is 51. Symptoms can come on slowly or be quite sudden depending on the changes in your hormones. You can learn more about the symptoms of perimenopause in our blog. Some women may find that their perimenopausal symptoms start as a worsening of premenstrual syndrome or premenstrual dysphoric disorder and the changes are gradual.\nIt is very important to speak to your GP if you think you may be perimenopausal under the age of 40, especially if you haven’t had a period for 4 months. This is because untreated premature or early menopause can impact your long-term health so an accurate diagnosis is key to getting the right support. \nEarly menopause may run in some families but, of course, every family is different. Genes may play a role in what age you start perimenopause but it’s not a definite way to predict.\nIt’s also worth noting that certain medical conditions or treatments can cause perimenopause or menopause early such as autoimmune conditions, genetic conditions such as Turner syndrome or treatment with surgery, chemotherapy or pelvic radiotherapy.\nWhat are the main symptoms of perimenopause?\nYou will often see it stated that there are 34 symptoms of menopause and perimenopause – but there are more, especially as people describe their symptoms in a variety of ways. You may only experience a couple of symptoms throughout perimenopause or experience every symptom — everyone is different. The average number of symptoms to have is seven, according to a survey by the British Menopause Society.\nSymptoms can be caused by the fall in progesterone levels during perimenopause or the fluctuations in oestrogen.\nPerimenopause symptoms might include:\n\nChanges to your periods\nHot flushes\nChanges to sleep\nBreast pain\nCyclical headaches\nPalpitations\nAnxiety\nMood change\nIrritability\nFatigue\nSkin and hair changes\nJoint and muscular pain\nGenital or urinary symptoms such as vaginal dryness, painful sex and urine infections\nLoss of libido\n\n….but can include more or less than the ones listed above.\nOften, you might start to notice changes in your body that are hard to connect and understand. Keeping a record of all your symptoms, writing them down and taking them to show your GP, can often make it easier to discuss whether these symptoms are due to perimenopause. Our fabulous perimenopause partners at Myla Health have a downloadable perimenopause symptom checker to help make sense of how you are feeling, and they can support you with accessing care and treatment.\n\nHow long does perimenopause last?\nPerimenopause usually starts between the ages of 40 to 45. Symptoms may only last for a few months or up to 12 years, but the average is between 4 to 8 years. This sounds terrifying, but don’t worry. 1 in 4 of you won’t have any symptoms at all. Symptoms can also come and go throughout this time, with some periods of worse symptoms before they may improve or disappear.\nYou may wish to speak to any female family members to see how long their symptoms lasted, you may find that your experience is similar to theirs. If you are struggling, there are lifestyle changes and treatment options to support you through this time. Keep reading for the lowdown on this!\nIs there a test for perimenopause?\nThere is a test for perimenopause, but it’s unreliable and the majority of people do not need to be tested. \nOver the age of 45, perimenopause should be diagnosed clinically, meaning diagnosis is purely based on your symptoms and does not require any blood tests. A blood test would be unreliable because, during perimenopause, your hormones fluctuate constantly. So a blood test would only show the hormonal levels on that particular day and not the overall picture.\nThe exceptions to this are if you are under the age of 45 with perimenopausal symptoms, if you are under the age of 40, or if you are on hormonal contraception which stops your periods and want to know if you can stop taking it.\nIf you are under the age of 40 and have not had a period for 4 months alongside perimenopausal symptoms, you should have a blood test to look for primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) (sometimes called premature ovarian failure or premature menopause). The blood test looks at the level of a hormone called follicular stimulating hormone (FSH) which rises during perimenopause and menopause. Your FSH level is measured twice, 4 to 6 weeks apart, to get an accurate reading and a clear diagnosis. Accurate diagnosis of primary ovarian insufficiency under the age of 40 is important as this can impact your long-term health if untreated and you can access treatment and further support.\nCan you get pregnant during perimenopause?\nYes, you can still get pregnant during perimenopause. It may seem unlikely, but your body may still be ovulating (releasing eggs) so fertilisation and pregnancy can still happen. Ovulation may be less frequent and more irregular but while you are still having periods, your body can still release eggs. It is still important that you consider contraception during perimenopause if you want to prevent pregnancy. Contraception can be combined with, or used as part of, hormone replacement therapy (HRT). HRT by itself isn’t a contraceptive! We also have a blog that will help you navigate which contraceptive pill is best during perimenopause. \nIf you are trying to conceive during perimenopause, there may be fertility support available and it’s worth discussing this with your GP early on or speaking to our experienced fertility nurse specialist.\nWhat are the signs that perimenopause is ending?\nPerimenopause symptoms can be variable throughout and may increase and decrease in severity. It’s hard to know whether perimenopause is ending based on symptoms alone. The medical definition of menopause is the day that is 12 months after your last period. This is also the day that perimenopause ends. Therefore the best indication that perimenopause is ending can be your periods.\nAs the length of time between periods stretches out more and more, it is a suggestion that you’re nearing menopause. Annoyingly, you can go many months without a period then suddenly have one at 10 months, and the 12-month count down to menopause begins again. Still, these large gaps between bleeds suggest perimenopause is ending.\nUnfortunately, perimenopausal symptoms may extend after menopause, but it’s difficult to predict which symptoms and who will get them. It’s important to know where to access support if your symptoms are persisting and affect your quality of life. Our partners Myla Health are a great place to start.\nPerimenopause symptom FAQs\nDoes perimenopause cause weight gain?\nWeight and perimenopause is complex. Over 50% of people may gain weight during the perimenopause. We understand how frustrating and upsetting it can be when your body changes. It is normal for your waist to become bigger through perimenopause, but you can still maintain your weight. Roughly, people gain around 1.5kg on average each year in perimenopause with a possible weight gain of about 10kg. However, you don’t have to sit back and watch the scales change. Remember that you’re not alone and support for perimenopause weight gain is available, talk to a healthcare professional if you’re feeling concerned.\nDuring perimenopause as oestrogen hormone levels reduce, your body deposits fat around the abdomen, rather than all over the body which is more common when you’re younger. As we get older, our muscle mass decreases which means we burn fewer calories on a day-to-day basis and this can lead to weight gain. Finally, because perimenopausal symptoms can make you feel completely rubbish, you may find that you’re consuming more calories or comfort eating. All in all, perimenopause can be a recipe for weight gain.\nHowever, the biggest predictor of weight gain is still how much you eat and drink, and how much you move. It sounds simple but it’s often really hard to change your lifestyle and lose weight, especially with perimenopausal symptoms. Firstly, get help to control your perimenopause symptoms so you are in a good place to make positive changes. With the right support, it’s possible to make lasting steps to reduce perimenopause weight gain, or lose weight.\nCan you be perimenopausal with regular periods?\nYes, you can be perimenopausal with regular periods. Perimenopause often causes changes to periods, but this doesn’t always mean they become irregular. Other changes to your periods such as heavier, lighter, longer or shorter bleeds can occur. Perimenopause has a vast collection of symptoms and is diagnosed on the symptoms you experience.\nIf you are experiencing symptoms of perimenopause without a change in your periods, you can still be diagnosed with perimenopause! If you’re unsure or confused, speak to your healthcare professional who can discuss a diagnosis in more detail. Taking a perimenopause symptom diary or checker to your appointment, like this one from our partners at Myla Health, can help start the conversation about perimenopause more easily.\nDoes perimenopause cause headaches?\nPerimenopause can cause headaches and this is a very common symptom occurring in up to 90% of us! These headaches are caused by the hormonal fluctuations during perimenopause. Oestrogen levels change a lot around puberty and during perimenopause which is a main trigger for both headaches and migraines. \nYou may notice a worsening of headaches and migraines around the time of your period, especially as periods can become heavier and longer. Migraines can become more severe during perimenopause; lasting longer and not responding as well to treatment.\nHeadaches and migraines do tend to improve after your periods have stopped, but it can still take some time for them to resolve completely as your oestrogen levels stop fluctuating, and there may be other contributing factors.\nTreatment for headaches and migraines is possible during perimenopause with lifestyle changes, medications and HRT, which when managed correctly can dramatically improve your symptoms.\nDoes perimenopause cause anxiety?\nYes, perimenopause can cause anxiety. Perimenopause and menopause commonly have an impact on your mental wellbeing due to symptoms such as anxiety, anger, irritability, depression, mood swings and loss of confidence. A survey by the British Menopause Society found that the psychological impact of perimenopause affected the social life of 36% of respondents.\nAnxiety may be worse during perimenopause if you have suffered from it before, or may suddenly appear without warning. This all sounds very grim, but identifying that you are suffering from anxiety means you can then access treatment. Treatment is based on your individual circumstances and may involve HRT, antidepressants, cognitive behavioural therapy or meditation techniques.\nIf the emotional symptoms of perimenopause are affecting your day-to-day life and you are experiencing any thoughts of self-harm or suicide, please please contact your GP, 111 or the Samaritans on 116 123 straight away.\nDoes perimenopause cause bloating?\nYes, bloating is very common during perimenopause and is usually worse in perimenopause than after menopause itself. Bloating is an uncomfortable or even painful swelling of your abdomen. It can be caused by a build-up of gas, fluid and poo. Some people barely notice their bloating but it can be really distressing for others.\nThe crazy fluctuations of hormones during perimenopause cause bloating, especially due to oestrogen levels rising before they come crashing down again. Oestrogen causes you to retain fluid which is a major cause of bloating. Other symptoms during perimenopause such as constipation can also cause you to bloat more.\nYou can take some simple measures to try to reduce bloating including increasing your fluid intake, exercise and reducing the intake of any triggering food or drink. A food diary is a useful tool to identify your triggers by recording when your symptoms are their worst alongside what you have eaten and drunk that day. Common culprits include caffeine, onions, beans and fizzy drinks.\nBloating can be a real nuisance but occasionally can be a sign of other more serious problems. If your bloating is worsening or not improving with the simple treatments above, and you have other symptoms such as a change in your bowel habits like diarrhoea or constipation, problems passing urine, bleeding or pain during sex, you should see your GP for further investigations.\nDoes perimenopause cause breast pain?\nYes, perimenopause can cause breast pain. Breast pain can come on suddenly due to the erratic hormonal changes during perimenopause, it may be continuous, or it may come and go in relation to your period. You can experience the pain in just one breast, or both, and the pain can be described as tenderness, soreness, burning, stabbing or throbbing. It is often due to increased fluid retention inside the breast tissue.\nBreast pain can improve after perimenopause but treatments such as HRT can cause it to continue for longer. Simple treatments like paracetamol, anti-inflammatories and supplements like starflower oil can help improve your breast symptoms.\nDoes perimenopause cause vaginal dryness?\nVaginal dryness is a very common symptom of perimenopause and affects over 50% over the age of 50. However, we don’t talk about vaginal dryness enough and only a quarter of those affected will actually seek help. Vaginal dryness is caused by reduced levels of oestrogen associated with perimenopause and menopause.\nDryness during sex is one of the first vaginal symptoms you may notice but annoyingly, you can also feel pain and discomfort not just during sex, but in everyday life. Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) is an umbrella term used to describe a whole spectrum of symptoms that can affect the vulva, vagina and urinary tract leading up to, during, and after menopause — including vaginal dryness.\nVaginal dryness can, confusingly, cause increased vaginal discharge which is more watery and a different colour. Often, people try to treat these symptoms with over-the-counter thrush treatment or may think they have a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Rather than dealing with vaginal dryness alone, speak to your healthcare professional as there are many treatments available including non-hormonal and hormonal products to improve your comfort and help you enjoy sex.\nPerimenopause treatment FAQs\nWhat are the treatment options for perimenopause?\nPerimenopause can be treated in different ways depending on your symptoms. Lifestyle changes including exercise, diet, sleep and reduction in smoking and alcohol can make a huge difference to your symptoms.\nHormone replacement therapy (HRT) provides your body with the oestrogen that is declining during perimenopause alongside progesterone to protect your womb lining from overgrowing (if you have a womb) in response to oestrogen therapy. HRT can treat many of the symptoms of perimenopause but needs a prescription from your healthcare professional as HRT has some small risks you should be aware of.\n\nOther prescription medications including antidepressants and medications for hot flushes may also be available from your GP if you do not want, or cannot have, HRT. Many supplements or natural remedies can help with symptoms such as poor sleep, fatigue, breast pain and some hot flushes. Complementary therapies and talking therapies such as mindfulness, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and acupuncture may also help manage symptoms.\nWhat types of HRT can be used for perimenopause?\nThe type of HRT used for perimenopause depends on your medical history and your periods. Everyone takes oestrogen to treat HRT symptoms, and if you have a womb, you will also need to use progesterone to protect your womb lining from overgrowing in response to the oestrogen you’re taking. \nIf you are still having periods, you will be advised to use cyclical (also called sequential) HRT where you take the progesterone part of HRT for 10 to 14 days each month causing your body to have a monthly bleed at the end of each course of progesterone. Some may only take the progesterone part every 3 months, meaning they only have a bleed every 3 months but this should be done under the guidance of an experienced menopause practitioner.\nIf you are not having periods, for example, if you use hormonal contraception or have had a hysterectomy, you can use continuous HRT where you take the same HRT every day. This means your hormone levels remain the same throughout the month and you should not have a monthly bleed.\nHRT can come in various forms such as tablets, patches, gels or sprays. Oestrogen given via the skin as a patch, spray or gel does not increase the risk of blood clots (which is slightly increased when oestrogen HRT is taken as a tablet). Progesterone can be similarly given as a tablet, patch, vaginal pessary or in the form of a hormonal coil such as the Mirena coil. All of these options are available during perimenopause but treatment is individualised to you, so be sure to discuss your options with your healthcare professional.\nThe above information is based on UK guidance.\nWhat supplements can help with perimenopause symptoms?\nThere are many many supplements available for perimenopausal symptoms and we know that 80% of people have tried supplements throughout perimenopause and menopause. Popular choices include isoflavones or phytoestrogens (such as soya products and red clover), St John’s Wort, valerian, black cohosh, evening primrose oil or sage.\nResearch shows all of these may improve symptoms like hot flushes for some, but the evidence isn’t brilliant, and actually, placebo tablets can have the same effect. It is really important to speak to a pharmacist before taking supplements if you are on any other medications because although supplements seem very safe and ‘natural’, they can interact with certain medications. If you have had breast cancer in the past, please discuss supplements with your oncologist or GP before taking them.\nThe British Menopause Society recommends that you check your supplements for the THR™ logo, which ensures they have been manufactured to a high quality and with safe doses.\nWhat is the best contraceptive pill for perimenopause?\nDuring perimenopause, you can choose to take whichever contraceptive pill suits you as long as your medical history allows.\nThe progestogen-only pill can be used alongside HRT for contraception. Some menopause specialists may even use two desogestrel-based progestogen-only pills as part of HRT, but this should only be done on specialist advice.\nThe combined pill contains both oestrogen and progestogen so can be useful to treat perimenopausal symptoms. The combined pill can be used up until the age of 50 if your medical history doesn’t change and you are eligible to use it. You cannot use the combined pill alongside HRT.\nThe standard combined pills contain a synthetic oestrogen which is different to the oestrogen used in HRT. Some newer brands of combined pill such as Zoely and Qlaira use a body-identical oestrogen similar to those used in HRT so may be more beneficial for perimenopausal symptoms, but there is no research evidence to support this……yet.\n \n",

        "Content": "\n✅ If you think this blog sounds interesting, make sure to check out our newsletter for more:\n\nMany people spend years trying to prevent pregnancy through practicing safe sex and using contraception. When you feel ready to start a family, it’s natural to want to know how to get pregnant fast. Let’s get into it.\nHow do I get pregnant?\nLet’s start with the basics of the menstrual cycle and how to conceive. Usually, a woman (or anyone with female reproductive organs) will ovulate (release an egg) around 14 days before their period. If you have penetrative (penis in vagina) sex and ejaculation happens inside the vagina, this releases sperm into the reproductive tract. \nIf the sperm and egg meet, the sperm can fertilize the egg which then implants into the womb and ta-da! A pregnancy. You can expect to see a positive pregnancy test around 2 weeks later when the pregnancy hormone levels rise.\nWhen should you start trying to get pregnant?\nTruthfully, there is no ‘best’ time to get pregnant and the choice to start trying to conceive is a personal decision. You can start trying to get pregnant whenever you feel ready. \nIt’s a good idea to plan in advance, as NHS guidelines suggest taking preconception vitamins (most importantly folic acid) for 3 months before getting pregnant. However, if you fall pregnant before these 3 months, don’t worry! \nYou can also start trying at any point during your menstrual cycle, and you don’t need to wait for a period to get going. \nThe only useful thing about waiting for your period is to know the approximate weeks of your pregnancy in the future.\nHow do I get pregnant faster?\nThere isn’t a magic formula to get pregnant really quickly, but we can offer some tips to make sure you and your partner are doing everything you can to help promote fertility and a healthy pregnancy. These include:\n\nHave unprotected sex 2 to 3 times each week\nAim for a healthy, balanced diet and get active\nTry to maintain a healthy weight but don’t over-exercise or calorie restrict which puts stress on your body\nAvoid alcohol, drugs and stop smoking\n\nUse our fertility quiz, written by doctors, to understand more about your fertility. \n\nWill contraception make it harder to get pregnant?\nIf you have been using hormonal contraception, it’s a common worry that it can reduce your fertility. Please be reassured that the majority of hormonal contraception has NO impact on your fertility.\nIn studies, 98% of users of the combined pill have their normal cycle return and start releasing eggs within 3 months of stopping. The contraceptive injection is the only form of hormonal contraception which can temporarily delay the return of fertility for up to 12 months for some people. So, if you’re planning a pregnancy in the near future, you may want to avoid the injection.\nHow long does it take to get pregnant on average?\nWe would LOVE to predict for each couple how long it will take to get pregnant. However, in reality there are too many factors that influence conception, so it’s very difficult to predict. \nUsing The Lowdown’s trying to conceive tool can give you a good idea of factors that might influence your ability to conceive and ideas to improve your fertility.\n1 in 3 couples will fall pregnant within the 1st month of trying.[1] This can be a surprise for those who expect it to take longer, and also frustrating for couples who have been trying for a while when everyone around them seems to instantly get pregnant.\nFor the majority of couples, it won’t be the first month, but 4 in 5 couples will get pregnant within 1 year, and 9 in 10 couples will be pregnant within 2 years.[1]\nSo really it’s normal for pregnancy to take anywhere between 1 month and 2 years. Knowing this can help ease any pressure you put yourselves under.\nWhat is the average time to get pregnant by age?\nWe know that natural fertility starts to reduce from your mid 30s. \nThis table shows how many couples will conceive within 12 months of trying at each age. These statistics are based on couples who have unprotected sex 2-3 times each week for 12 months.[5]\n\n\n\n\n\nAge\n\n\nPercentage of women who will conceive within 12 months\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n\n70%\n\n\n\n\n35\n\n\n60%\n\n\n\n\n40\n\n\n40%\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWhy am I not getting pregnant?\nHealth problems such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis and other medical conditions may increase the time it takes for some couples to get pregnant. This isn’t the case for everyone and it’s important to start trying with a positive mindset.\nIf you have a medical condition, such as those found in our trying to conceive tool, speak to your GP if you haven’t fallen pregnant within 6 months. This doesn’t mean you won’t fall pregnant naturally, it just allows you to start the referral process if you need help. So keep trying!\nThe vaginal microbiome is your unique composition of healthy “good” bacteria which help to keep the vagina’s environment stable and at an acidic pH. If there is an imbalance of “good” and “bad” bacteria this is called dysbiosis. Imbalance in your bacteria can not only cause infections like thrush and BV, but also has a role in getting pregnant. ScreenMe is the only UK-based test that can screen for every single bacteria or yeast within your vaginal microbiome.\nWhen should I speak to a doctor?\nIf you have been trying to conceive for 12 months and have not fallen pregnant, your GP is the first place to start. Your GP can do initial tests including blood tests, an STI screen and an up to date cervical smear (if needed) and then refer you to a fertility specialist. \nHowever, you may be able to have tests and get referred earlier if:\n\nyou are over 36\nyou have PCOS or endometriosis\nyou or your partner have other medical conditions which can affect pregnancy\nor if you suspect you have PCOS, endometriosis or a condition which hasn’t been diagnosed yet\n\nIt’s a good idea to keep a log of when you started to conceive, your menstrual cycle and how often you are having unprotected sex to discuss this with your GP.\nWhat can I do to get pregnant?\nIf you have been trying to conceive for a long time and have not fallen pregnant, fertility specialists can help. First, you will need to undergo tests to see if there is a reason you have found it difficult to conceive. \nThen, different treatments can be offered depending on the cause. These may include:\n\nMedications to encourage you to release an egg each month\nSurgical procedures, for example, to treat endometriosis, PCOS, fibroids or blockage of either the male or female reproductive systems\nAssisted conception which includes intra-uterine insemination (IUI) or in-vitro fertilization (IVF)\n\n \nHow can The Lowdown help?\nAt The Lowdown, we have a fantastic team of women’s health experts who can discuss any concerns you may have about coming off contraception, your menstrual cycle, PCOS or endometriosis. \nIf you would like to think about optimising your fertility or have worries about trying to conceive, our fertility expert is also available to help.\nThe Lowdown can also connect you to other women and couples similar to yourself to share your experiences on our trying to conceive platform. We know that the power of community is so important through these times of life, and we want to be there to help.\n\nLeridon H.

        "Title": "What does endometriosis feel like? How to discuss with your doctor",
        "Content": "\nWe asked our Instagram community how they describe their endometriosis pain. NHS registered GP, Dr Fran Yarlett explains how people with endometriosis can talk to their GP about this kind of pain. This post contains real quotes from people living with endometriosis. \nWhat is endometriosis pain?\nEndometriosis is a common health condition that can cause heavy, painful periods, painful sex and affect your quality of life. It takes an average of 7-8 years to diagnose endometriosis. So how can you speak to your GP about your symptoms to speed this up?\nEndometriosis pain is often described as moderate to severe – but that can mean different things to different people. The pain may start in your lower stomach or pelvic area but can spread around your lower back and into your legs. Paracetamol or ibuprofen might take the edge off but often does not completely get rid of the pain.\nPain can start a couple of days before your period and might last all the way through your period and for several days after. Some people may even experience constant pelvic pain.\nEndometriosis can also cause bleeding symptoms including heavy periods, long periods, bleeding between periods or passing old or dark blood before a period.\nWhat does endometriosis feel like?\nEndometriosis pain may be felt as burning, stabbing, pressure-like, cramping, throbbing or any other description of pain found in a thesaurus. Pain is subjective meaning people feel it in individual ways. We asked our community what endometriosis feels like: \n\n\n\t\t\t\t“Knife stabbing arse. Uterus trying to fall out. Radiating pain into legs.”\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t“Constant ache, pulling, sharp stab pains, twisting, unbearable, exhausting”\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t“Stabbing, burning, searing, crippling, nausea inducing, so bad you pass out from it”\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t“At its worse it felt like everything inside was burning and ripping”\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t“Like barbwire inside my pelvis”\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t“Like Freddie Kruger is clawing at my insides”\t\t\t\n\nThe most common answer to describe endo pain from our community was “debilitating”. You can read through our shared endometriosis experiences and ask our community how they describe their pain.\nAs GPs, we’re looking for any pain which affects your ability to carry out your daily activities. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t“Paralysing. Nothing else matters when it happens”\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t“All consuming. Cannot focus on anything else”\t\t\t\n\nFor example: if you’re unable to work, go to school, exercise, put out the washing, walk the dog etc. This is a key symptom, and even if this doesn’t turn out to be endometriosis, if period pain is affecting your quality of life, you should always seek help, because we can make things much better!\nHow to explain endometriosis pain?\nIt can be daunting to visit your GP, especially when appointments are so short.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t“It’s not just the debilitating pain, it’s the added weight of people not believing you”\t\t\t\n\nDuring consultations for possible endometriosis, I want to know:\n\nWhere the pain is and where it spreads to.\nWhen the pain comes on and how long it lasts.\nWhat the pain feels like.\nHow bad the pain is. Often a scale of pain from 1 to 10 is useful, with 1 being no pain, and 10 being the worst pain you’ve ever experienced.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t“6 on a good day. 15 on a bad!”\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t“10 + on bad days…. 4-6 everyday life”\t\t\t\n\n\nWhat makes the pain better or worse (including sex!)\nAny other symptoms, and I mean ANY, because some symptoms may be relevant even if you do not think they are.\n\nOther symptoms usually associated with endometriosis include fatigue, low mood, bloating, pain during sex, pain opening your bowels (especially during your period) and blood in your urine or stool during your period. \nIt’s really helpful if you bring answers to these questions to your appointment, alongside a log of symptoms throughout 3 cycles to identify any patterns associated with your period.\nHow to treat endometriosis pain?\nThe pain from endometriosis can be debilitating but there are treatments.\n\nPainkillers including paracetamol and ibuprofen are available over the counter or prescription only medications such as mefenamic acid \nHormonal contraceptives are effective at treating pain and you can use our recommender to find the right fit for you\nTaking supplements, such as Wild Nutrition, can help target hormonal support. They will help overcome fatigue and tiredness too.\nTENS machines such as the Myoovi are clinically proven to help (purchase one via our affiliate link – they’re currently on offer!)\nThe good old hot water bottle!\nAlternative therapies such as acupuncture may be beneficial for some women but the research around this isn’t great\nA women’s health physio can help with exercises to improve pain\n\nHow to get diagnosed with endometriosis?\nAfter your GP appointment, you might be offered treatments, investigations and/or a referral to a gynaecologist. Endometriosis can be diagnosed through scans of the pelvis including ultrasound or MRI. \nHowever, these are not always the most accurate, and a normal scan does not rule out a diagnosis of endometriosis. If scans are normal but you have ongoing symptoms, a keyhole surgical procedure called a laparoscopy is the usual investigation to diagnose endometriosis.\n You need to be seen by a gynaecologist before being placed on a waiting list for a laparoscopy. Waiting lists for gynaecology appointments and laparoscopies can be long, which is annoying, and why treatment for your symptoms should be started while you wait. \nA newer investigation called advanced ultrasound is excellent to diagnose endometriosis without the need for an operation, but is only performed by a very few trained clinicians. \nWith increased training and funding, advanced ultrasound may be used in the future as an easier and less invasive way to diagnose endometriosis.\nThe waiting is a frustrating time for many of our community, which is why our specialist team of GPs are available to provide a listening ear and help you start treatment to ease your symptoms. \nIf you’re concerned, speak to our doctors about endometriosis early and connect with other Lowdown members to ask advice about their endometriosis experience.\n\n\n",

        "Title": "Does endometriosis affect fertility?",
        "Content": "\nThis post contains Amazon affiliate links for supplements our doctors recommend – we earn a small commission too \nWhat is endometriosis?\nEndometriosis is a common health condition affecting 190 million people worldwide[2]. Annoyingly, no one knows the true cause of endometriosis. The condition causes cells which are similar to the lining of the womb (the endometrium) to grow in places outside of the womb, for example, on your ovaries, pelvic wall, and even your bowel. Symptoms often include heavy periods, chronic pelvic pain and fatigue, although some people will never have any symptoms. Endometriosis can also affect fertility in some people.\n\nHow does endometriosis affect fertility?\nEndometriosis may affect fertility as it can affect the reproductive organs, including the ovaries and fallopian tubes. It can cause adhesions (scar tissue) where pelvic organs become stuck together through inflammation or through ovarian cysts. However, we still don’t fully understand how it all works.. Up to 50% of women[3] who are being investigated in fertility clinics are found to have endometriosis, and for many of them struggling to get pregnant is their only symptom.\nJust because you have a diagnosis of endometriosis does NOT mean you can’t conceive naturally. We do know that most couples (60 to 70%) will get pregnant within 1 year of trying to conceive, compared to 84% of couples where endometriosis is not an issue[4]. In fact, our Founder Alice, who has endometriosis herself, conceived her first child naturally.\nHow can I improve my fertility with endometriosis?\nWe would advise anyone trying to conceive to boost their fertility through following a healthy diet, exercising (but not to excess), and reducing alcohol. You should make sure you’re taking folic acid and vitamin D (buy from Amazon), and check out our endometriosis reviews for other supplements which have helped women when trying to conceive. \nOur expert fertility nurse Kate can offer individualised advice on how to optimise your fertility.\nYou can also take our fertility quiz to see how you can improve your fertility, whether you’re trying right now, planning for the future or just curious! \n\nSurgical removal of endometrial deposits and cysts has been shown to improve your fertility, as well as managing pain, and is often used as a treatment for fertility problems in women who are found to have endometriosis. The best time to try to conceive with endometriosis is felt to be soon after surgical removal of these endometrial deposits or cysts.\nIf you are thinking about starting a family, but aren’t quite ready, using hormonal contraception may help reduce the progression of endometriosis until you are ready to conceive. There is little research in this area, but studies have shown that without treatment, endometriosis slowly gets worse over time. If tolerated well, hormonal contraception can help manage pain and other symptoms. Reducing the progression and severity of endometriosis may also therefore help to protect your fertility. There is no evidence other drug treatments for endometriosis improve fertility. We’ve got lots more information on the best contraceptive for endometriosis, or you can discuss your options with our team of women’s health experts.\n\nHow long will it take to get pregnant with endometriosis?\nHow long it takes to get pregnant is dependent on lots of factors, one of which may be endometriosis. Our trying to conceive tool can give more of an indication on which factors are important for you and your partner. Fertility seems to be related to the severity of endometriosis found through a laparoscopy (keyhole surgery to help diagnose endometriosis). 75% of women with mild endometriosis will conceive within 1 year, 50% of women with moderate endometriosis and 25% with severe endometriosis will conceive within one year of trying.[4]\nEven with endometriosis, you can become pregnant very quickly, like this Lowdown reviewer:\n\nOthers may take longer:\n\nIf you want to learn more about what it’s like trying to conceive with endometriosis, you can ask people who have been through it on The Lowdown! Just leave a comment on any of our endometriosis experiences to ask questions and get tips, for instance, on how long it took to get pregnant, and other advice from personal experience.\nWhat if I’m not getting pregnant with endometriosis?\nFor many couples, taking up to a year to get pregnant is completely normal. However, if you are diagnosed with endometriosis, you may be able to get referred for fertility support and treatment earlier than people who don’t have endometriosis. Depending on your local area, you may be offered further tests and support to get pregnant if you haven’t conceived within 6 months. It’s best to speak to your GP after 6 months, or even before you start trying, to understand what is available to you locally.\nFertility specialists can offer surgery to remove endometriosis, treat endometrial ovarian cysts or help conception with methods such as ovulation induction or in-vitro fertilisation (IVF). \nWhere to get support for endometriosis and fertility?\nIf you are experiencing symptoms of endometriosis and cannot endure the NHS waiting list for a scan, then Scan.com can offer you the chance to skip the queue and book in for a private scan instead. Scans include; MRIs, ultrasounds, CT and X-ray scans in your local area, so they become easy and accessible to you. \nIf you have endometriosis or suspect you might have it, our expert women’s health GPs and fertility specialist nurse can advise on preparing for pregnancy and what to do if you have any issues. Your own GP can offer referrals for further fertility support if needed.\n\nTrying to get pregnant can be a stressful and sometimes lonely journey, which is why our unique user reviews from our endometriosis and trying to conceive communities are here to help. You can filter through hundreds of real life experiences to find someone just like you, connect with them and learn how they managed this process.\n\n\n",

        "Content": "\nThis post contains Amazon affiliate links for supplements our doctors recommend – we earn a small commission too ❤️\n✔️ If you think you’ll find this blog informative, make sure to check out our newsletter for more:\n\nWhat is PCOS?\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common problem which causes a hormonal imbalance in around 10% of people with ovaries.[1] The name comes from follicles seen on the ovaries, which look like “cysts”, but are actually small fluid filled sacs that contain an egg that hasn’t been released. PCOS typically causes symptoms of irregular or absent periods alongside acne and unwanted hair growth, many other physical symptoms have been reported — from bloating, to fatigue and snoring. You can read more about how PCOS affects The Lowdown community differently through their shared experiences.\nHow does PCOS affect fertility?\nPCOS affects the ability to ovulate (release an egg) which is crucial for pregnancy. Ovulation happens around 14 days before your period, and therefore, regular periods are a good indicator of ovulation. With PCOS, the hormonal imbalance means ovulation often doesn’t happen, which is called anovulation. The mechanism of anovulation is not fully understood. In couples who are found to have anovulation at fertility clinics, 70-80% of them are diagnosed with PCOS.[2]\nIrregular or absent periods are a sign that ovulation might not be happening regularly, or at all. And it also makes it reeeaaally difficult to work out your fertile days to have sex if your menstrual cycle isn’t regular. \nTo sum up, PCOS impacts fertility as ovulation may be unpredictable and sporadic which reduces opportunities for the sperm to meet an egg, which, as we know, is needed for pregnancy to happen.\nHow can I improve my fertility with PCOS?\nIf you have PCOS, you can improve your fertility in similar ways to people without PCOS. Lifestyle changes play a huge role in PCOS symptoms, these are often things you can do yourself without involvement from a healthcare professional. Lifestyle changes can also be magical for your fertility, as this Lowdown user found:\n\nImportant lifestyle changes to make to improve fertility include:\n\nStopping smoking\nReducing your caffeine intake\nReducing how much alcohol you drink\nExercise regularly, but not to excess\nAiming for a healthy weight\nUse ScreenMe for vaginal health swab tests\n\nWeight loss is often a tricky subject for people with PCOS because the condition itself makes it easy to gain weight and difficult to lose it. Weight stigma is also commonly experienced by PCOS sufferers [3] so it’s frustrating that body mass index known as ‘BMI’, which is a poor indicator of individual health, is used as a criteria for fertility treatment. There is also no evidence that a particular diet (such as keto, calorie counting, Slimming World etc) or type of exercise (high intensity vs. low intensity) is better for weight loss if you have PCOS.[3]\nIt’s best to find what works for you as an individual, which may be with the support of a dietician or nutritionist specialising in PCOS. Losing just 5% of your body weight can have a really positive impact on your fertility.\nYou can also take our fertility quiz to see how you can improve your fertility, whether you’re trying right now, planning for the future or just curious! \n\nIf you want to have a personalised discussion about the treatments and lifestyle changes for PCOS that might work for you, speak to one of our women’s health doctors.\n\nWhich supplements can improve fertility in PCOS?\nAnyone who is trying to conceive should be taking vitamin D and folic acid supplements to promote a healthy pregnancy, which are pretty cheap to pick up from many supermarkets and pharmacies.\nA popular supplement called myo-inositol has been shown to improve ovulation in some people with PCOS.[4]. You can purchase myo-inositol on Amazon (check out the reviews!)\nIf you choose to take myo-inositol, another supplement called alpha-lactalbumin can help your body absorb more of the myo-inositol, possibly making it more effective.[5] However, these supplements can be expensive, and you should always talk to your healthcare provider before taking them if you are using any other medications.\nHow long will it take to get pregnant with PCOS?\nThe time it takes to get pregnant with PCOS varies between individuals. We’d love to give an answer, but it’s really very difficult to predict because your fertility and when you conceive is down to lots of different factors. \nIt’s normal for 80% of couples with no fertility problems to take up to 12 months to conceive.\n46% of couples with mild fertility problems and 11% of couples with severe fertility problems will get pregnant naturally within 12 months.[6]\nUsing apps like Ovusense can help you track when you ovulate.\nWhat if I’m not getting pregnant with PCOS?\nIf you’re not getting pregnant, remember, this could be due to other problems including in your partner, rather than your PCOS. Our fertility specialist nurse can help identify any issues. It can also take a few months for your cycle to return to what is normal for you after coming off contraception, which can be a reason for the delay.\nIf you are having less than 3 periods a year, then you may be able to ask your GP for referral for fertility support before or when you start trying to conceive. You should also be referred for fertility support after 6 months of trying to conceive if you have PCOS.\nIn PCOS, lack of ovulation is often the cause of fertility problems. Fertility treatment can induce ovulation through medications such as:\n\nClomid which will help between 20 to 50% of couples have a baby successfully with treatment. [7,8,9]\nMetformin. One study suggests up to 8% of couples will have a baby with Metformin alone, but this can be used in combination with other medications. [7,8]\nLetrozole, 28% of couples will go on to have a baby with treatment. [8]\nGonadotrophin hormone injections with which between 40 to 60% of couples will successfully have a baby.[9,10]\n\nFurther fertility treatment includes in-vitro fertilisation or a surgical procedure called laparoscopic drilling which is successful in around 50-60%.[11] There are plenty of options to help and treatment for PCOS associated fertility problems is often really successful.\nWhere can I get support for PCOS and fertility?\nPCOS is a really variable condition which affects some people more than others. We often hear from people that they feel alone and frustrated about the lack of insight from healthcare professionals, alongside limited research for healthcare professionals to base treatment on. That’s why we have our team of women’s health GPs who can listen and provide guidance to manage both symptoms and fertility concerns.\nIf PCOS affects your fertility, we know it can be incredibly emotionally draining. One Lowdown reviewer said:\n\nThis is why The Lowdown PCOS community is a great place to find others just like you, who you can connect with for support and guidance. Check out our PCOS platform and comment on other posts to ask questions, share your own experience to help others.\n\n\n",

        "Content": "\nIs Microgynon safe for breastfeeding mothers?\nIn the first 6 weeks following childbirth, you are at an increased risk of experiencing a blood clot in the legs or lungs compared to other times in your life. \nThe combined pill also slightly increases your risk of a blood clot and therefore it is recommended that you do not use this in the first 6 weeks following childbirth. Your risk of blood clots related to your recent pregnancy reduces over time and therefore it is safe to start the combined pill once you reach 6 weeks post pregnancy if you are breastfeeding. \nIf you are not breastfeeding you may be able to start a combined pill from 3 weeks post pregnancy (if you have no other medical problems which increase your risk of a blood clot). \nWhen taking a combined pill, like Microgynon, this does have some small risks associated with it, irrespective of whether you have recently been pregnant or not. \nThere continues to be a slight increased risk of blood clots when you take the combined pill after 6 weeks post-pregnancy and it also slightly increases your risk of breast cancer and cervical cancer. There is also a chance it could increase your blood pressure. \nAll of these risks are very small if you are otherwise fit and healthy, are a healthy weight, maintain a healthy diet, do not smoke or drink excessive alcohol and do not have any other medical problems or risks. \nIt is always best to discuss your individual case with a healthcare professional however so that your risk can be adequately assessed. When you order the combined pill through us at The Lowdown you’ll be asked to complete a short questionnaire which is reviewed by our pharmacists to assess your individual risk. \n\nDoes Microgynon affect milk supply?\nThere is no strong medical evidence to suggest that Microgynon affects breast milk supply.\nLots of research has been done on this topic and the conclusion is that there has not been any research that has consistently demonstrated that Microgynon (or other combined pills) negatively impact a breastfed baby’s growth or the ability of the mother to continue breastfeeding. \nThis suggests that even if the milk supply is affected by taking Microgynon, it is not enough to have an effect on the baby. Usually your milk supply will have been well established by 6 weeks into your breastfeeding journey and therefore it is unlikely to be lowered by the hormone content of the Microgynon pill. \nDespite the medical evidence however – some women do report a change in their supply when taking Microgynon. Therefore it should not be dismissed as completely impossible. \nYou should consider this as a potential possibility when deciding whether or not to take the Microgynon pill, especially if you already have some problems with breast milk supply. \nWhat other methods of contraception can you take while breastfeeding?\n\nMost methods of contraception are available to you when breastfeeding. You may not require any additional contraception if you meet certain criteria when breastfeeding:\n\nYou are fully breastfeeding day and night (you are not giving your baby any other liquid or solid food) AND \nYour baby is less than six months old AND\nYou have no periods\n\nThis method (known as lactational amenorrhoea) is considered to be over 98% effective at preventing pregnancy.\nIf you do not meet the above criteria, or you would prefer some additional contraception, there are several other options:\n\nProgestogen-only pill \nContraceptive injection\nContraceptive implant\nHormonal intrauterine device (aka hormonal coil or IUS)\nNon-hormonal intrauterine device (aka copper coil or copper IUD)\nCombined hormonal contraceptive vaginal ring and patch\nBarrier methods such as condoms or the contraceptive diaphragm or cap\n\n\nMost of these methods can be started immediately following childbirth (apart from combined methods), but your individual case and eligibility should be discussed with a healthcare professional. \nIf you are considering a coil, also known as an IntraUterine Device (IUD) this would usually need to be fitted either within 48 hours of childbirth or after 4 weeks post childbirth, due to the risk of damage to the womb. \nWhen you are breastfeeding there is a higher chance of perforation (making a hole in the lining of your womb) when having a coil fitted. The risk is still very low, but you should be made aware that breastfeeding does increase this risk slightly. IUDs are extremely effective methods of contraception however and should not be dismissed for this reason alone. \nCheck out our contraceptive pages and reviews for more information on each of these methods!\n\n",

        "Content": "\nLearn about how Microgynon 30 and Microgynon ED affect the most common symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), including acne, hair loss, and irregular periods. Plus, explore alternative options such as the vaginal ring, contraceptive patch, and hormonal coil.\nWhat is PCOS?\nPolycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal disorder that affects the function of the ovaries. We are still unsure about its causes, but we think it might be related to a hormonal imbalance that impedes the egg from developing properly. It is also usually characterised by the presence of fluid filled sacs that look similar to cysts on the ovaries. Common PCOS symptoms include irregular periods, acne, excess hair growth, weight gain and difficulty getting pregnant (1). \n\nWhile there is no cure for PCOS, there are treatments available that can help manage your symptoms. One such treatment is the combined birth control pill, and in this post, we will focus on Microgynon 30, one of the most popular contraceptive pills in the UK, and Microgynon ED.\n\nWhat is Microgynon 30? \nMicrogynon 30 is a combined contraceptive pill containing two hormones: ethinylestradiol (a type of estrogen) and levonorgestrel (a type of progestogen). It is a small tablet to be taken orally every day. It works by preventing ovulation, thinning the lining of the womb, and thickening the cervical mucus, making it harder for sperm to reach the egg.\nWhat is Microgynon ED?\nMicrogynon ED is the same as Microgynon 30, but it comes in a pack of 28 tablets, seven of which are placebo pills. It was designed to make it easier to take if you often forget to take the next tablet on the right day. However, it’s important to note that there are no health benefits associated with the seven-day hormone break, and taking your pill back to back might actually increase the pill’s effectiveness and even reduce its side effects. Therefore, it is solely a matter of preference and what works best for you. If you’re curious about the benefits of taking the pill back to back, you can read this blog about it.\nIf you’re unsure which contraception method is right for you, check out our contraception recommender tool to find the one that suits your lifestyle.\nIs Microgynon good for PCOS?\nYes, Microgynon could be a good treatment option for PCOS. \nThe combination of progestogen and oestrogen hormones in the pill can help regulate the menstrual cycle and reduce the levels of androgens in the body, which can help manage symptoms such as irregular periods, acne, and excess hair growth. Let’s dive into each of these PCOS symptoms their relation to Microgynon.\nMicrogynon and Acne\nAcne is a common symptom of PCOS and can be particularly difficult to manage. However, the oestrogen in Microgynon 30 can help reduce the severity of and treat acne. In a review of 12 studies, researchers found that combined oral contraceptives, like Microgynon 30, were among the most effective ways to reduce acne in women with PCOS (2). You can check out our guide on the best contraceptive pill for acne to know more about how hormones affect our skin.\nMicrogynon and excess hair growth\nExcess hair growth (hirsutism) is another common symptom of PCOS. The growth is caused by the increased levels of androgens like testosterone in the body. Oestrogen inhibits sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), a hormone that controls testosterone production. The effect of this can reduce excess hair growth. To know more about how PCOS affects hair growth, how the pill can inhibit it and how to manage it, check out this amazing blog on PCOS and hirsutism. \nMicrogynon and irregular periods\nIrregular and infrequent periods are a hallmark symptom of PCOS and can be particularly difficult to manage. However, the hormones in Microgynon 30 can help regulate the menstrual cycle by controlling when you bleed. This can include stopping periods altogether if you wish, or reducing the frequency and intensity of periods. In fact, combined hormonal contraception is recommended as the first-line treatment for menstrual irregularity (3).\n\n \n\nCheck out our reviews for Microgynon 30 and Microgynon ED.\nWhat other types of contraception can I use for PCOS?\nThe patch and the vaginal ring work very similarly to the Microgynon pill. They both contain oestrogen and progestogen; the main difference is how you take them. Therefore, they are both good options to explore if you’re struggling with PCOS.\nOther combined-pill types (in particular pills containing the progestogen drospirenone like  Yasmin) may also be helpful for PCOS, as they tackle symptoms such as acne, hair loss and hirsutism. You can check out the reviews for each type of combined pill. \nLastly, the hormonal coil could also be a good option for people with PCOS, as it helps keep the womb lining thin and reduces the risk of endometrial cancer which can increase with very infrequent periods associated with PCOS. One potential drawback is that it does not produce regular periods if that’s something you would prefer.\nYou can check out our guide on the best contraception for PCOS for an in-depth analysis of each type and its effects on other symptoms, such as weight gain.\nThe best type of contraception for PCOS varies from person to person, so it’s a good idea to speak to a women’s health GP who can guide you in finding the best option for you.\n  \n",

        "Title": "Cerelle and endometriosis &#8211; can it help symptoms?",
        "Content": "\nEndometriosis is a common women’s health condition affecting 1 in 10 women which can cause symptoms that can really impact your quality of life. Endometriosis is caused by cells similar to those found in the womb lining growing elsewhere in the pelvis, including on the ovaries, pelvic wall, bladder or bowel. Unfortunately, the exact cause of endometriosis is still unknown.\nAnnoyingly, it can take a long time to get a diagnosis of endo and so people can spend years trying to control the symptoms of pain, fatigue and heavy periods. Often, people are recommended contraception for endometriosis as a treatment for the symptoms.\nHormonal birth control is a great way to control endometriosis symptoms by making periods lighter, shorter, less painful or even disappear.\nWhat is Cerelle?\nCerelle is a form of hormonal contraception that contains a progestogen called desogestrel. It is a brand of progestogen-only pill that is widely used and available. It works by preventing ovulation (release of an egg), thinning out the womb lining to prevent pregnancy and by thickening cervical mucus so sperm can’t enter the womb. Cerelle is very effective at preventing pregnancy – 99% if used perfectly, but it has other benefits which are used in endometriosis.\n\nIs Cerelle good for endometriosis?\nCerelle is brilliant to use as a treatment for endometriosis due to its benefits other than preventing pregnancy. Clinical research studies have shown that progestogen-only contraceptives such as Cerelle are associated with improved period pain alongside less pelvic pain, more comfortable sex and a better quality of life overall! [1]\nAs mini-pills like Cerelle thin out the womb lining, they can also thin out and reduce the inflammation caused by endometrial deposits found outside the womb in the pelvis, therefore reducing the pain associated with endo. Pills such as Cerelle or other hormonal contraceptives are used as a first line treatment while you wait for more definitive treatments like surgery (if you choose this). Cerelle is also safe to use for the majority of women, so if you’re suffering with symptoms of endo, you can order the pill online from The Lowdown to give it a try.\nIf you’re still not convinced, check out our Cerelle reviews below from real users. You can even leave your own reviews, to share your experience with others like you.\nLighter periods\nPeriods with Cerelle and other mini pills can be lighter and less regular which is some relief for endo sufferers.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t“I get light spotting from time to time but aside from that, it’s been a great pill for my periods!”\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCerelle Review\n\n\n\nNo periods\nA huge 44% of the Lowdown users had no periods while taking the progestogen-only pill. No periods = no endo period pain which is only a good thing!\n\n\n\t\t\t\t“I have endometriosis, have taken this pill for 10 years with no period, at all.”\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCerelle Review\n\n\n\nPeriod cramps and pelvic pain\nPerhaps one of the worst symptoms of endometriosis is the constant pain, but luckily Cerelle can also help women too.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t“Cerelle has been much better than I expected. It has not affected my mood and the reduced sex drive is not as significant as with other pills. It’s completely stopped my periods and helped improve my pelvic pain from endometriosis. My skin and acne are the same as without the pill – quite oily and acne prone.”\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCerelle Review\n\n\n\nIf you have a diagnosis of endometriosis or think you might, it’s important to get support, treatment and not to suffer alone. If you have any concerns about endometriosis and need someone who will really listen, speak to our women’s health doctors who are experts in advising the best contraceptive for you and your situation. If you think that’s Cerelle, then skip the queue and order Cerelle online through The Lowdown. \n\n\nOne of The Lowdown’s fab Clinical Directors, Dr Frances Yarlett MBBCh (Hons) BSc (Hons) MRCP (2016) MRCGP DFSRH completed her medical training from Cardiff University in 2013.

        "Content": "\n Forgotten to take your Microgynon pill?! Not to worry, help is on hand. When life gets busy it can be easy to forget to take your pill on time. When do you need to worry about taking emergency contraception? Read on to find out exactly what you need to do if you have missed a Microgynon pill.\nDo you need to take Microgynon at the same time every day?\nIdeally it is best to try and remember to take your Microgynon pill at the same time everyday as it helps with getting into the habit of remembering to take it – like when you brush your teeth! However in the event of forgetting to take it , you have 24 hours to remember to take it in.\nCan you take the Microgynon Pill 2 hours late?\nYes you can take it 2 hours later than you normally would and it will still work the same as normal.\nHow late is considered a missed microgynon pill?\nA Microgynon pill is ‘missed’ if it is more than 24 hours since you were due to take it (or more than 48 hours since you took your last pill)\n\nWhat happens if you miss one Microgynon pill?\nIf you miss one Microgynon pill anywhere in your packet, this does not affect the effectiveness of your pill and does not put you at risk of pregnancy. You can still take the missed pill even if it means taking more than one pill in a day. Don’t worry, taking 2 pills won’t cause you any harm. \nYou should continue taking the rest of your pack as normal. You can have your 7 day break if you use Microgynon 30 or take the 7 placebo pills if you take Microgynon 30 ED.\nWhat happens if you miss two Microgynon pills?\nIf you miss two Microgynon pills, this could affect the effectiveness of your pill, depending on where in your pack you missed them. See below for a detailed guide on missing your pill at different places in your pill pack. \nDays 1-7 or Week 1\nIf you have had unprotected sex and missed 2 or more microgynon pills or started your pill 2 or more days late in the first week of your pill pack then you may need emergency contraception. Check our missed pill calculator to see if you do. You should take your next pill as normal and use condoms for the next 7 days or avoid sex. You should complete the rest of your pack including your pill free week if you  have this or your placebo pills.\nDays 8-14 or Week 2\nIf you have missed 2 or more Microgynon pills in the second week of your pack, take the next pill as soon as you remember even if it means taking 2 pills in one day. You do not need emergency contraception but should use condoms or additional protection for the next seven days. You should complete the rest of your pack including your pill free week or your placebo pills.\nDays 15-21 or Week 3\nIf you have missed 2 or more Microgynon pills in the third week of your pack, take the next pill as soon as you remember even if it means taking 2 pills in one day. You do not need emergency contraception but should use condoms or additional protection for the next seven days. If you take Microgynon 30 you should not have your pill free break but start your next pack as soon as you finish your last pill. If you take Microgynon 30 ED you should take your next pack as soon as you finish your last active pill. You should miss your week of placebo pills.\nIt is worth mentioning that if youmiss more pills at any point in your pill pack, your Microgynon pill is unlikely to be effective and you may need emergency contraception if you have had unprotected sex.\nIf you are still unsure what to do, head over to the missed pill calculator!\n\nCan you get pregnant if you miss a Microgynon pill?\nIf you have only missed one Microgynon pill in your pill pack then you are still protected from pregnancy even if it is the first pill in your pack. However, missing more than one pill in a row or at random times within your pack may put you at risk of pregnancy. This is particularly the case if you have had unprotected sex in the week after forgetting your pill. The Lowdown makes it easy to order emergency contraception fast if you ever find yourself in a pickle. \nRemembering to take your pill \nThere are lots of different ways to remember to take your Microgynon pill on time. From putting an alarm on, to leaving your pill next to your toothbrush, it depends on what works for you. Once you form a habit of taking the pill regularly (which usually takes about 30 days to form) you are more likely to maintain this and are less likely to miss pills. If you do find you are missing pills despite lots of attempts to remember to take them it may be worth trialling a different form of contraception that may suit you better. Our contraceptive recommender tool is a good starting point to help you find the best contraceptive for you. You can also book a consultation with one or our lovely doctors if you need further advice.\nForgetting to reorder your next pill pack is a common reason for missed pills. By using the Lowdown’s subscription delivery service you can order online and have your pills delivered to you with next day delivery!

        "Title": "We’ve announced our best contraceptives &#8211; as rated by you!",
        "Content": "\nWelcome to the contraception Oscars! Thanks to everyone who has shared their review on our contraception review platform. We’ve now collected almost 6,000 reviews and have enough data to nominate the best contraceptives in most categories. So, without further ado, here are the highest rated contraceptives at The Lowdown.\nFAM is the highest-rated contraceptive\nThe Fertility Awareness Method is the winner of the ‘Best contraceptive’ award, with an average satisfaction rating of 4.4 out of 5, just beating the runner up – the Hormonal coil! We have worked out this ranking by taking all contraceptive methods with over 100 reviews on our site and comparing their scores.\nFertility Awareness or Natural Family Planning is an umbrella term for methods which help you work out your fertile days (or fertile window). You then need to avoid sex or use condoms during that time to prevent pregnancy. iYou have to be pretty disciplined and proactive, tracking indicators such as waking temperature, cervical fluid and cycle length in order to identify your fertile days. This umbrella method includes digital contraceptive apps like Natural Cycles, and DIY methods like the symptothermal method which if used perfectly can be up to 98 to 99% effective.\nWe’ve read your reviews, and it seems like many of you are enjoying the process of learning about your body and being in tune with your hormones.However, the negative reviews usually mention the Fertility Awareness Method being unreliable in predicting ovulation day, resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. \nThe most notable stat from our review data, is that 49% of you reported a very positive effect on your mood, and 51% of you reported an increase in sex drive, which, between us, is quite uncommon for a contraceptive method nowadays. \n\nThe best contraceptive in each category goes to…\nEloine is the highest-rated combined pill \nEloine, one of the newest types of pills around the block, has already earned the title of ‘Best-combined pill’. This method is around 91 to 99+% effective and comes in a pack of 28 tablets, four of which are placebo pills. This pill contains a low dose of oestrogen and a progestogen called drospirenone, which could help with mood swings and acne. Our reviews support this; 84% of you say it improved your skin.\nSome of the most commonly reported side effects include period-like cramps (54%), tender breasts (54%), vaginal dryness (46%), breast enlargement (42%) and discharge (38%).\nHere’s what The Lowdown community has to say about the effects of Eloine on mood, bleeds, sex drive, weight, skin and cycle return:\n\nThe Mirena coil is the highest-rated hormonal coil\nThe Mirena coil wins ‘Best hormonal coil’, with a rating of 3.5 out of 5, and we are not surprised; it’s always been our fave out of the five hormonal coil brands we have on The Lowdown. This method works by releasing a low amount of progestogen into your womb. This coil is over 99% effective and can last up to 6 years.\nOne of the main reasons why it might be rated so highly is because of the few side effects associated with it.  Plus many users experience up to 90% lighter bleeds or even no period at all after it’s been fitted. Last but definitely not least, the Mirena coil doesn’t seem to impact women’s moods or sex drive as much as other methods, such as the contraceptive pill, implant or the injection. \nOur reviews indicate that the Mirena coil has also eased the symptoms of disorders such as endometriosis and PCOS, which might explain why healthcare professionals also love this one. \nSome of the most common side effects of the Mirena coil include period-like cramps (62%), vaginal discharge (45%), tender breasts (45%) and lower back pain (30%).\nHere’s what The Lowdown community has to say:\n\nCerelle is the highest-rated mini pill\nCerelle takes the cake of ‘Best progestogen-only pill’; with a rating of 2.8/5 overall, beating its peers Cerazette and Desogestrel which contain exactly the same hormones, but also the older traditional mini pills like Norgeston and Noriday. This pill is around 91 to 99+% effective and works by ingesting a pill containing desogestrel every day. \nSome of the most common side effects of the Cerelle pill include tender breasts (53%), vaginal discharge (50%), period-like cramps (49%), breast enlargement (43%) and lower back pain (42%). \nHere’s The Lowdown:\n\nThe Depo-Provera is the highest-rated injection\nThe Depo-Provera beats the Sayana Press and wins ‘Best injection’ with a score of 3 out of 5, even though they have the same ingredient (medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA). The main difference between the two is that Depo-Provera has to be administered by a healthcare professional into the muscle as opposed to the Sayana Press, which can be injected at home. Depo-Provera is around 96-99+% effective, and it works by injecting a high dose of progestogen, which stays in your system for three months. \nHere’s how it stacks up: \n\nThe Evra patch is the highest-rated hormonal patch\nThe only brand of patch available currently is the Evra patch, so it’s a straightforward win for the title of ‘Best patch’, which has a score of 3.5 out of 5. This method is around 91 to 99+% effective. The Evra is a combined hormonal contraceptive and works by applying a thin beige plaster to the skin that needs to be changed weekly. \nSome of the most common side effects of the Evra patch include breast enlargement (49%), tender breasts (46%), period-like cramps (43%), vaginal discharge (41%) and nausea or vomiting (35%).\nHowever, we currently don’t have enough reviews for this method! So if you’re currently using the Evra or have used it before, leave a review here!\n\nNexplanon is the highest-rated implant\nOnce again, the only implant we have on our site, the Nexplanon is currently rated at 3 out of 5 and the winner of ‘Best implant’. This method is over 99% effective and works by having a small plastic rod inserted in your upper arm by a nurse or doctor. The implant then releases progestogen into your bloodstream slowly over 3 years.\nMany women experience changes to their period while on Nexplanon, which can result in a lighter orheavier bleeding or your periods stopping altogether. Some other common side effects reported by The Lowdown community are tender breasts (54%), vaginal discharge (44%), period-like cramps (42%), vaginal dryness (40%) and breast enlargement (37%).\n\nThe symptothermal method is the highest-rated fertility awareness method\nSymptothermal beats Natural Cycles as the best fertility awareness method with a banging score of 5 out of 5; however, it currently only has very few reviews. This method is up to 99% effective if used perfectly.

        "Content": "\nLearn about how Microgynon 30 and Microgynon ED affect the most common symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), including acne, hair loss, and irregular periods. Plus, explore alternative options such as the vaginal ring, contraceptive patch, and hormonal coil.\n\nWhat is PCOS?\nPolycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal disorder that affects the function of the ovaries. \nWe are still unsure about its causes, but we think it might be related to a hormonal imbalance that impedes the egg from developing properly. It is also usually characterised by the presence of fluid filled sacs that look similar to cysts on the ovaries. \nCommon PCOS symptoms include irregular periods, acne, excess hair growth, weight gain and difficulty getting pregnant (1). \nWhile there is no cure for PCOS, there are treatments available that can help manage your symptoms. \nOne such treatment is the combined birth control pill, and in this post, we will focus on Microgynon 30, one of the most popular contraceptive pills in the UK, and Microgynon ED.\nWhat is Microgynon 30? \nMicrogynon 30 is a combined contraceptive pill containing two hormones: ethinylestradiol (a type of estrogen) and levonorgestrel (a type of progestogen). It is a small tablet to be taken orally every day. It works by preventing ovulation, thinning the lining of the womb, and thickening the cervical mucus, making it harder for sperm to reach the egg.\nWhat is Microgynon ED?\nMicrogynon ED is the same as Microgynon 30, but it comes in a pack of 28 tablets, seven of which are placebo pills. It was designed to make it easier to take if you often forget to take the next tablet on the right day. However, it’s important to note that there are no health benefits associated with the seven-day hormone break, and taking your pill back to back might actually increase the pill’s effectiveness and even reduce its side effects. Therefore, it is solely a matter of preference and what works best for you. If you’re curious about the benefits of taking the pill back to back, you can read this blog about it.\nIf you’re unsure which contraception method is right for you, check out our contraception recommender tool to find the one that suits your lifestyle.\nIs Microgynon good for PCOS?\nYes, Microgynon could be a good treatment option for PCOS. The combination of progestogen and oestrogen hormones in the pill can help regulate the menstrual cycle and reduce the levels of androgens in the body, which can help manage symptoms such as irregular periods, acne, and excess hair growth. Let’s dive into each of these PCOS symptoms their relation to Microgynon.\nMicrogynon and Acne\nAcne is a common symptom of PCOS and can be particularly difficult to manage. However, the oestrogen in Microgynon 30 can help reduce the severity of and treat acne. In a review of 12 studies, researchers found that combined oral contraceptives, like Microgynon 30, were among the most effective ways to reduce acne in women with PCOS (2). You can check out our guide on the best contraceptive pill for acne to know more about how hormones affect our skin.\nMicrogynon and excess hair growth\nExcess hair growth (hirsutism) is another common symptom of PCOS. The growth is caused by the increased levels of androgens like testosterone in the body. Oestrogen inhibits sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), a hormone that controls testosterone production. The effect of this can reduce excess hair growth. To know more about how PCOS affects hair growth, how the pill can inhibit it and how to manage it, check out this amazing blog on PCOS and hirsutism. \nMicrogynon and irregular periods\nIrregular and infrequent periods are a hallmark symptom of PCOS and can be particularly difficult to manage. However, the hormones in Microgynon 30 can help regulate the menstrual cycle by controlling when you bleed. This can include stopping periods altogether if you wish, or reducing the frequency and intensity of periods. In fact, combined hormonal contraception is recommended as the first-line treatment for menstrual irregularity (3).\nOrder Microgynon from The Lowdown \n\nCheck out our reviews for Microgynon 30 and Microgynon ED.\nWhat other types of contraception can I use for PCOS?\nThe patch and the vaginal ring work very similarly to the Microgynon pill. They both contain oestrogen and progestogen; the main difference is how you take them. Therefore, they are both good options to explore if you’re struggling with PCOS.\nOther combined-pill types (in particular pills containing the progestogen drospirenone like  Yasmin) may also be helpful for PCOS, as they tackle symptoms such as acne, hair loss and hirsutism. You can check out the reviews for each type of combined pill. \nLastly, the hormonal coil could also be a good option for people with PCOS, as it helps keep the womb lining thin and reduces the risk of endometrial cancer which can increase with very infrequent periods associated with PCOS. One potential drawback is that it does not produce regular periods if that’s something you would prefer.\nYou can check out our guide on the best contraception for PCOS for an in-depth analysis of each type and its effects on other symptoms, such as weight gain.\nThe best type of contraception for PCOS varies from person to person, so it’s a good idea to speak to a women’s health GP who can guide you in finding the best option for you.\n\n  \n",

        "Title": "Can you take the morning-after pill while breastfeeding?",
        "Content": "\nIf you’re breastfeeding and need emergency contraception, you may be wondering whether taking the morning-after pill is effective and safe. Here’s the Lowdown on what you really need to know, including how it will affect your breast milk and other hormone-free options you can explore.\nWhen should I take the morning-after pill?\nThe emergency contraceptive pill, also known as the morning-after pill , can prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex. Unprotected sex refers to sexual activity where no contraception was used, was used incorrectly (such as missed pills, a late injection or implant), or has failed, such as a condom breaking. In these instances, taking the morning-after pill can help prevent unintended pregnancy.\nThe window of time you’ll have to take the pill after unprotected sex will depend on the type of morning-after pill. You can check out which morning-after pill is right for you here, but for now, let’s discuss the relationship between emergency contraception and breastfeeding.\n\n \nIs the morning-after pill safe to take while breastfeeding?\nYes, taking the morning-after pill is generally considered to be safe to take while breastfeeding. However, the side effects may vary depending on the type. Currently, there are two types of morning-after pills available on the market. The first type contains levonorgestrel and it includes brands such as Levonorgestrel, Ezinelle, and Levonelle One Step. The second type, EllaOne, contains ulipristal acetate. \nBoth types of morning after pills are safe to use 21 days after childbirth, there’s no need to use contraception before then⁽¹⁾. However, knowing that they may have side effects on breastfeeding is important. So let’s talk about them for each type. \nCan I breastfeed after taking the morning-after pill?\nYes, you will be able to breastfeed after taking the morning-after pill. However, each type of morning-after pill is linked to potentially different effects on the amount of breast milk you can produce.\nThe quantity and consistency of breast milk for women who took the morning-after pill containing levonorgestrel did not differ significantly from those who did not take emergency contraception⁽²⁾. \nAs for EllaOne, we don’t have any clinical studies for the effects on breastfeeding and breastmilk; however, you might experience a lower amount of milk production after taking this emergency contraceptive⁽³⁾. The milk is considered safe for the baby to drink after a week since you take the pill. In the meantime, the expressed milk should be discarded. \n\n\n \nDoes the morning-after pill affect breast milk?\nThe evidence on levonorgestrel-based emergency contraception (LNG-EC) suggests no significant differences in milk production and infant health and development between women who took this type of emergency contraception and women who didn’t⁽¹⁾. It is therefore considered safe for your baby to consume the milk after taking this morning-after pill type. \nFor one of the most commonly used pills, Levonelle, you might have a small amount of hormones pass into the breast milk, but you shouldn’t worry, as it’s not harmful to the baby. \nWe need more research to confirm the effects of breastfeeding while taking EllaOne. Therefore, the manufacturers advise waiting one week (7 days) before resuming breastfeeding and discarding the milk expressed in the meantime⁽¹⁾.\nCan I use other forms of contraception while breastfeeding?\nWhile contraception is generally not required for the first three weeks (21 days) after childbirth, you might want to think about which contraception method to adopt after this period or start a method before then to ensure you are covered. The good news is that plenty of safe options are available while breastfeeding – some of which you can use immediately after giving birth.\nThe copper IUD is a great option to consider since it doesn’t affect breast milk quantity or consistency. IT can be used both as emergency contraception and ongoing contraception. You can have it inserted as soon as 28 days after childbirth or within the first 48 hours. However, it’s important to note that it comes with a small risk of perforation.\nHormonal contraception also provides several safe and effective options that can be started immediately after childbirth; these include:\n\nProgestogen-only pill (mini pill)\nInjection\nImplant\nHormonal coil \n\nKeep in mind that if you choose to go for the hormonal coil, you’ll have to wait 28 days before insertion, just like with the copper IUD, unless you can have it fitted within 48 hours of birth⁽⁵⁾.\nCombined contraception methods such as the combined pill, the vaginal ring or the patch are also safe to use while breastfeeding, but should be started no earlier than six weeks after childbirth⁽⁵⁾.\nYour maternity team be able to organise for an IUD or IUS to be fitted at the time of delivery, for example if you’re having a planned caesarean section. Some maternity services may have someone who can give you the injection, or fit an implant for you. If the procedure cannot be carried out due to timing or staff shortages, they will direct you to where you can obtain your chosen contraceptive and offer an alternative in the meantime.\nIf you want to know more about which method is best for you, check out Dr. Fran’s incredibly comprehensive guide to contraception after childbirth for a deep dive into each method.\nIf you have any other doubts or need advice on which contraception to use while breastfeeding, you can book a call with one of our lovely women’s health GPs, who can help you choose the best option for you. \n\n \nCan I use breastfeeding as a form of contraception?\nYes, but only in some cases and if you follow very specific criteria. A pretty cool but lesser-known fact about breastfeeding is that it’s actually 98% effective in preventing pregnancy if used as the lactational amenorrhea method (LAM). This is how the method works: if your baby is less than six months old, and you exclusively breastfeed both day and night without experiencing menstruation, then you can depend on breastfeeding as your method of contraception. However, if any of these circumstances change, such as your baby starting to sleep through the night and feeding less or using other supplements such as baby formula or using a dummy as a comforter, you will require an alternative, reliable, reliable form of contraception. Get the Lowdown on breastfeeding and contraception.\n If you’re unsure whether the LAM method would work for you, why not book a consultation with one of our GPs to discuss it further. \nHave you had unprotected sex and need emergency contraception?

        "Title": "Can you get pregnant on your period?",
        "Content": "\nWhat’s the lowdown?\n\nGenerally, no you can’t get pregnant in the first few days of your period if you have a ‘normal’ regular menstrual cycle length of 28 days or longer, but you shouldn’t rely on just your period dates to prevent pregnancy\nIf you have a shorter cycle length you are likely to ovulate soon after your period, meaning unprotected sex during your period at the beginning of your menstrual cycle can risk sperm and egg meeting\nIt helps to understand a bit more about your cycle, when the risky time is and when you are likely to ovulate each month\nUsing Fertility Awareness Methods can help you identify fertile and non-fertile times of the month\n\nSo after a lot of research and many discussions, we can, in fact, confirm that you are super unlikely to get pregnant on your period!\nHere is why:\nMedical advice has always erred on the side of caution, and the internet is full of advice that you can get pregnant at any point in your cycle. \nAlthough, you can never be 100% sure of pregnancy risk, it is fair to say that you are more at risk at a certain point of your cycle than at others.\nTo fully understand the chances and how this can happen, first, you’ll need to understand how pregnancy happens.\nSo let us explain… it’s all about egg and sperm meeting! Sounds simple, but here is the maths….\n\nIf you have a regular menstrual cycle, you are likely to be ovulating once a month\nThe earliest date of ovulation is 14 days before your period starts and an egg survives for up to 24 hours after it is released from the ovary\nSperm can live up to 7 days in the female reproductive tract.¹  Although the mean survival time has been estimated to be 1.47 days with less than 5% probability of sperm surviving more than 4.4 days.²\nThere is therefore a ‘fertile window’ each month when it is possible for an egg to meet sperm and a pregnancy can happen.\n\n\nThis maths doesn’t work if you take hormonal contraception or have taken the emergency contraceptive pill (morning-after pill) in your last cycle.\nHow do I calculate my earliest ovulation day?\nThis can be calculated if you have a regular cycle. It is a bit more tricky to predict if you have irregular cycles, but not impossible.\nDay 1 = first day of your period\nThe earliest ovulation date is your cycle length minus 14 days\nIf you have a 28 day cycle, earliest date of ovulation is 28 minus 14 = Day 14\nIf you have a 35 day cycle, earliest date of ovulation is 35 minus 14 = Day 21\nIt is a bit hard to explain this information clearly for each individual, and it requires you to have an accurate record of the lengths of past menstrual cycles, hence why healthcare professionals tend to use the blanket advice that you can get pregnant at any part of your cycle.\nKnow your cycle\nUsing this knowledge to help prevent pregnancy is only advised for those who have a good idea of when they are ovulating i.e. those who use Fertility Awareness Methods (FAM) where you monitor changes in your body such as daily body temperature and cervical mucus changes to predict ovulation.\nIf you have unprotected sex at any point in your cycle and aren’t using FAM then you still need to use emergency contraception as you can’t be sure when you have ovulated based on your menstrual data alone.\nCan you get pregnant on your period?\nIf you have a regular and normal length cycle (around 28 days) and you have not used emergency contraception pills in your cycle, you can’t get pregnant on your period (technically speaking this means during days 1 to 6 of your menstrual cycle with day 1 being the first day of your period). This is because if you have a 28-day cycle, the earliest date of ovulation is 28 minus 14 = day 14.  Sperm lasts up to 7 days so if you had sex before day 6 sperm won’t be around by the time of ovulation to meet an egg. \n\nCycle lengths can vary between individuals but the average length is 28 days with most cycle lengths between 25 to 30 days.³ \nIf you have a shorter cycle length then there is more risk of egg and sperm meeting. For example, if you have a 23-day cycle, the earliest date of ovulation is 23 minus 14 = day 9 (day 1 being the first day of your period).  Sperm lasts up to 7 days so if you had sex after day 2 of your menstrual cycle whilst on your period there is a potential risk of egg meeting sperm.\nAs mentioned before, if you have unprotected sex at any part of your cycle and are not using FAM you need to consider emergency contraception just in case. This is because your cycle length (and day you ovulate) has the potential to vary month to month so these calculations alone should never be used to predict your fertile window or when it is safe to have sex.\nCan I get pregnant during my period on combined birth control?\nIn short, no – you cannot get pregnant when you have a withdrawal bleed on combined hormonal contraception.\nIf you are using combined contraception (e.g. the combined pill, patch or vaginal ring) correctly and consistently, then you should be protected against pregnancy all the time, which includes during the scheduled seven-day (or shorter) break, or the days you take your placebo pills, when you may experience a withdrawal bleed like a period. You can still have sex during this week without getting pregnant, as long as you took the last packet of pills correctly and start the new pack correctly.\nCan I get pregnant just before my period?\nThe probability of pregnancy if you have unprotected sex a couple of days before your period is very slim but unless you are tracking your cycle and using FAM, you still need to consider emergency contraception.\nYour fertility window closes soon after you ovulate, this is because an egg only lives for around 24 hours after it is released from the ovary, which is approximately 14 days before your period starts so there is no opportunity for the egg and sperm to meet. \nHow many days after my period can I get pregnant?\nThe number of days after your period when ovulation can occur varies between people and can change from month to month.\nEveryone has different cycle lengths, which is why we calculate your earliest date of ovulation as 14 days before your period starts (i.e. we only know once your next period has already started).  If you have a very short cycle, ovulation could happen relatively soon after your period stops. \nFor example, if you have a 25 day cycle the earliest date of ovulation would be (25 minus 14 =) day 11. Sperm can live for up to 7 days, so if you have sex from day 4 of your cycle, you could get pregnant.\nCan I get pregnant during my first period after giving birth?\nYou can get pregnant before your first period after a pregnancy.\nAfter giving birth, the earliest possible ovulation date is 21 days after birth. On average, ovulation takes a bit longer, especially if you are breastfeeding. If you are having sex in the first few months after having a baby, then you need to start contraception before three weeks post-baby arrival.  \nOvulation will happen before you have a period, and many people get caught out by this!\nWe have written a handy blog about contraception after a baby.\nCan I get pregnant during my first period after an abortion?\nYou can get pregnant before your first period after an abortion.  \nThe advice about ovulation after an abortion varies, but it is true that you can ovulate and get pregnant before you have a period. Abortion providers say you can ovulate as soon as five days after an abortion.⁴ It is recommended that contraception is started within five days of abortion to ensure no risk of ovulation and unintended pregnancy.⁵ \nDoes tracking my cycle really help?\nYes, tracking your cycle can help you to understand your fertile window, especially for those who do not want to use hormonal contraception.  Understanding your cycle is the key to empowering yourself with the tools to understand pregnancy risk. Apps to help track your cycle can help to build a picture of ovulation and lengths of cycles but shouldn’t be used for contraception.\nThere are various period tracking apps around, however if you’re looking to use a fertility awareness app for contraception the Natural Cycles app is a CE-marked medical device.⁶ The Natural Cycles app contains an algorithm that analyses your temperature (measured using a thermometer), menstrual cycle data and optional LH (luteinizing hormone) tests to calculate when you are fertile, and tells you to avoid sex or use other protection like on your fertile days. \nOther more traditional fertility awareness methods require you to use a combination of indicators of ovulation and work out your fertile window manually. To do this we recommend you get support from a fertility awareness practitioner. The NHS website recommends you use a Fertility UK practitioner – you can find one on the Fertility UK practitioners site here.\nDoes this mean I can have unprotected sex at different times in my cycle?\nIt depends!! \nYes – if you are using a FAM where you are calculating ovulation and your fertile window. FAM uses multiple different signs and symptoms to predict when you are ovulating and when you need to use extra protection. You should not be just using the dates of your period as your only data.\nNo – if you are not using FAM then you still need to use emergency contraception as you can’t calculate when you have ovulated and therefore might be at risk of an egg and sperm meeting. This is why the emergency copper coil is so great as it can be used up to 5 days after unprotected sex or up to 5 days after the earliest date of ovulation, giving you a longer window than the morning after pill to prevent unintended pregnancy.\n Toggle Title\nDr Becky is part of The Lowdown’s medical team.

        "Title": "GyneFix: Everything you need to know",
        "Content": "\n✅ If you think you’ll find this blog helpful, then make sure to subscribe to our newsletter:\n\n\n \nWhat is the GyneFix?\nThe GyneFix is a type of copper contraception that is frameless and works to prevent pregnancy by releasing copper into the womb, similarly to the IUD (copper coil) and IUB Ballerine. \nThere are two types of GyneFix, the GyneFix 200, with four copper sleeves and the GyneFix 330, with six copper sleeves¹. \nWhat is the GyneFix made of? \nThe GyneFix is made of a non-biodegradable suture thread made of surgical 00 monofilament polypropylene (AKA a type of plastic) on which the copper tubes are threaded. \nHow long does the Gynefix last?\nIt lasts for 5 years and is 99% effective. This is similar to other traditional IUDs that can protect from pregnancy for 5-10 years, depending on the brand, which are all also 99% effective. \nHow is the GyneFix inserted and is it painful?\nIt lasts for 5 years and is 99% effective. This is similar to other traditional IUDs that can protect from pregnancy for 5-10 years, depending on the brand, which are all also 99% effective. \nThe GyneFix should be inserted with a pre and post insertion ultrasound. This is to measure the womb cavity and to ensure it’s placed properly within the uterus to avoid risk of perforation. The person who fits the Gynefix must have all the training and ultrasound experience². \nWe spoke to the research team at GyneFix HQ. Dr. Wildemeersch, a researcher in intrauterine contraception, compared T-IUD insertions to walking into a shoe store, picking out any box and saying “well these are my shoes now, I sure hope they fit’. The Gynefix insertion procedure means that you are making sure your contraception is the correct fit for you beforehand. \nIt is inserted with a thin tube that passes the cervical canal (the gap in the neck of the womb). To anchor it, a knot is tied at the end of the thread and implanted into the tissue at the top of the uterus. The knot ensures it stays in place. \nThis diagram explains how the tube is inserted into the uterus: \nEfficacy of a mini version of the frameless GyneFix intrauterine system (IUS) with effective copper surface area of 200 mm2 – ScienceDirect \n\n \nMaarten De Winter from the research team at GyneFix HQ told us “Insertion is not more painful than other IUDs as patient comfort is included in our training. We often hear from gynaecologists that have completed the training that it’s actually very easily placed, just a little different from other IUDs,”. \nDue to this way of fitting, there is a small risk of perforation (forming of a hole in your uterus/bowels). This occurs when the tissue at the top of the uterus hasn’t been properly measured for thickness which is why it is essential to have a pre insertion ultrasound. \nA research study did find one perforation was noted in 3,000 fittings³. Make sure to talk with the person who fits your device so you are fully informed of the risks associated with insertion.\nAfter insertion, there will be an ultrasound to make sure it’s been placed correctly. You are also advised to not have sex for 14 days, as well as to not use tampons and menstrual cups for 2 months. There should be a 4-8 week follow up review.\n\n \nIs GyneFix available in the UK?\nIt has been on the market for 25+ years but it is unfortunately very limited in the UK due to pricing issues. The makers of the GyneFix recently confirmed that they have begun procedures to re-enter the UK market. \nHow is the GyneFix removed?\nTo remove the GyneFix, the gynecologist, GP or nurse has to retrieve the thread in the cervical canal with a thin alligator forceps and pull on the frameless thread in one swift pull. \nResearch did find that ‘removal required significantly more force for the GyneFix’⁴ than the force used to remove the IUD. The force level differs due to the nature that it is attached to the fundal tissue.  That said, there was no ‘significant difference in pain perceived by women during removal’. \nDoes GyneFix cause heavy periods compared to the Copper IUD? \nEveryone may experience the GyneFix differently and the impact on bleeding varies from user to user. With traditional copper coil users, 65% of Lowdown reviewers report heavier bleeds. \nOne study in Belgium found that for those with the GyneFix 200 bleeding did not change from their baseline over 31 months⁵. However, this doesn’t mean bleeding reduces using this method and if bleeding is something you are concerned about, the hormonal IUS may be a better option as many users find that their periods are lighter or stop altogether. \n\nWhat’s the difference between the Copper IUD and the Gynefix?\nThe main difference between the copper IUD and the GyneFix is shape. As a contraceptive, it works in exactly the same way. \nThe IUD has a T-shape while GyneFix is frameless. Users of the GyneFix prefer this option as it’s smaller, flexible and fits all types of uterus shapes, especially those with smaller uteruses. \nThe makers of the GyneFix told us “smaller device and less copper = More patient comfort”.\nThe GyneFix has only been reviewed 3 times on The Lowdown at the time of writing, but has received a 5 star overall review. Side effects reported have included heavier menstrual cycles for the first few months and spotting⁶. Copper IUD users also report heavier bleeds and spotting.\nFrom our limited review data of GyneFix, the contraceptives are pretty similar but the insertion and shape are the only distinct differences. \nHave you used the GyneFix?

        "Title": "My experience of ectopic pregnancy",
        "Content": "\nTowards the end of last year I started to feel a very strange pain in my lower pelvis and had a (normally timed) period that seemed to last weeks. Now, as a woman with endometriosis, I know a thing or two about pelvic pain. But this was like a pain I’d not felt before. Combined with a strange aversion to Wednesday night’s Mexican dinner with the girls, something made me realise that something was really not right. \nThat Friday morning I did a pregnancy test and it was a faint positive. I wasn’t excited because I realised I might be having an ectopic pregnancy. \nLet’s take a moment to explain what ectopic pregnancy is and how to spot it:\n\nAn ectopic pregnancy is when a fertilised egg grows outside the womb, in the wrong place. Normally in one of the fallopian tubes.\nUnfortunately it’s not possible to save the pregnancy and it will never grow into a baby. It often has to be removed either by operation, medication or letting it pass naturally.\nSymptoms can include a combination of:\n\nLower tummy pain, usually one sided \nVaginal bleeding or spotting\nPain in the tip of your shoulder\nDiarrhoea or loose stools\nPain or discomfort passing urine or opening your bowels \n\n\nAn ectopic pregnancy can rupture causing internal bleeding. Symptoms of this include feeling lightheaded, dizzy or faint, severe tummy pain or vomiting. \nIt is potentially dangerous and in cases of rupture can be life-threatening, so if you think you may be pregnant and have any of these symptoms seek urgent medical attention like I did.\nThe risk for the general population is very low – just over 1% of pregnancies are ectopic (about 1 in every 90 pregnancies)¹\nWhat I didn’t know is that there is some research that people who’ve had a previous infection in their fallopian tubes or endometriosis have a higher risk of ectopic pregnancy²\n\n\n\nI rang my GP who told me to go to A&E, where I was seen ASAP. Some blood tests and ultrasounds later I was told to wait a few more days for further tests to find out what was happening. My pregnancy hormone levels weren’t so high that I needed to be rushed into surgery to have the pregnancy removed, nor were they low enough or dropping quickly enough to be a miscarriage. I was in a strange limbo. \nHow did I feel? On one hand I was shocked that this was happening to me, on the other not surprised at all. It feels par for the course that I will experience a whole range of women’s health issues; from having countless side effects from my contraception to being diagnosed with endometriosis. It’s safe to say I’m really not looking forward to the menopause.\nLike most things in life, the reality of doing the thing you’d always imagined you would do, is so very different. Trying to get pregnant can be an immensely frustrating and confusing experience, punctuated by memories of changing sanitary towels and having logical conversations with complete strangers about your menstrual cycle. \nOne thing that I noticed was that whilst in hospital, three wonderful (and completely overworked) healthcare professionals asked me how many weeks pregnant I was. I really struggled to answer that question because a) I’d just found out that I was pregnant a few hours ago and had barely processed that information, and b) I didn’t really consider myself ‘pregnant’, in the sense that things were clearly not moving forward. \n\nMy Early Pregnancy Unit pre appointment questionnaire\nI can now understand how difficult and confusing it must be for people who think they might be experiencing an ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage to hear this language, and wonder if there’s a better solution. Dr Mel and I agreed that perhaps asking people in my situation when their last period was might be a better way to ask the same question. I’m sure there are lots of other much more impactful examples where the medical terminology needs rethinking or reframing, and I’d love to hear your thoughts on this. \nAfter a weekend of more tests, and then the agony of waiting 12 hours for a poor on-call Gynae registrar to call me at 10pm Sunday evening, we received the call that confirmed the pregnancy was not progressing and likely to be ectopic. \nThis was mainly down to pregnancy hormones. When you’re pregnant your body produces a hormone called hCG or Human Chorionic Gonadotropin; the hormone that can make some women feel nauseous.\n\nIf you have suspected ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage, doctors will check your hCG levels with a blood test:\n\nWhen you’re having a progressing pregnancy, your hormone levels should roughly double every 48 hours.\nIf your hormone levels drop a lot (50% every 48 hours) you’re likely to be miscarrying.\nIf they drop or only rise a little bit, it’s possible the pregnancy is ectopic – or basically growing in the wrong place, and you’re going to miscarry as it won’t progress. \n\nI was in the bracket of women whose ectopic pregnancy is managed through ‘expectant management’, which basically means you wait and see. For women who do this, between 30-100% of the time their body ends the pregnancy on its own, similar to a miscarriage.²\nThe news that the pregnancy wasn’t progressing hit me harder than I thought. Whilst I knew it probably wasn’t going to be good news, there was a small glimmer of hope that maybe, just maybe, the pregnancy will work out ok. I personally found this glimmer of hope almost impossible to extinguish. It’s like the monthly glimmer of hope that persuades you that your PMS symptoms are pregnancy symptoms, or that the start of your period is implantation bleeding. The glimmer of hope loves to make the wave of disappointment bigger.\nI dialled into our Monday morning team call to tell The Lowdown team, and have a good cry. Naturally, I don’t understand why women should have to suffer through these things and stoically just ‘get on with it’. Today, around the world there are hundreds of thousands of women and people with vaginas dealing with unexpected, delayed or longed-not-for periods, bleeds, miscarriages and pregnancies. \nSadly, because of our society’s squeamish airbrushing of vaginas (including having strong opinions on the way they look, smell, grow hair and make sound) we make it hardest for people with vaginas to get support when they need it the most. This is the reality of our bodies, and so often it’s dusted away in this synthetic view of womanhood and motherhood. In its place is clickbait content about ‘the best sex positions when trying for a baby’. \n\nNo one is laughing and no one is eating salad\n Like many, I hope that in a few years time miscarriage and baby loss become like mental health. Something that 10 years ago no one talked about, but now is part and parcel of most people’s everyday language.  \nOne final point. The hormones are wild. The worst part for me was a week or so later when the adrenaline subsided. You wake up in your house for what feels like the 100th day in a row, and the only thing you can think about doing is making a cup of tea. You can’t exercise to lift your mood as it hurts. You can’t socialise because it feels like so much effort. You’re sick of being in the house, but equally you don’t want to leave the house. Those are the s**t days. To any of The Lowdown community reading this who’ve gone through any of these hormonal post-partum-post-miscarriage-post-anything days, I have so much empathy for what you’re going or have gone through.\nIf my experience was just 1000th of what it’s like to have a later or recurrent miscarriage or stillbirth, I really cannot comprehend how hard that must be to recover from. We must do better as a society and healthcare system to support and give you and your partner what you need in those moments. \nOver the weeks and months that have followed, we have received some lovely emails and calls from customers telling us how much The Lowdown has helped them. These messages brought me so much happiness, and I get so much satisfaction and pleasure out of doing my dream job.\nHaving this experience has only spurred me on to keep improving the lived experience of what going through these things is like for us. If you’d like to share your journey with me, or tell us about your experiences of trying to conceive – I’d really love to hear from you.\nAlice set up The Lowdown in 2019 with a mission to help transform the minefield that is  contraception. She’s spent the last four years talking to thousands of women about this problem – and leads on the delivery of our product, brand and overall proposition.\n",

        "Title": "Does Microgynon stop or delay your period?",
        "Content": "\n✔️If you think you’ll find this blog interesting, subscribe to our newsletter for more:\n\nMicrogynon 30 and Microgynon ED are popular combined contraceptive pill choices and are often one of the first brands you may try. Try our easy recommender tool to see if it’s the best contraception for you and your symptoms. Microgynon can be used to either completely stop or delay periods depending on how you take it.\nTraditionally the Microgynon is taken for 21 days followed by a break of between 4 and 7 days. In Microgynon ED, the 7-day break is built within a 28-pill packet by including 7 placebo pills at the end of the packet. In this break, the change in the levels of hormones causes your body to shed the womb lining in a withdrawal bleed. We call this a withdrawal bleed rather than a period as no egg has been released to be expelled from the body (accompanied by cramps, crying and chocolate cravings if you’re like me). \nHowever, modern life has changed and we may want more control over when we have these withdrawal bleeds or if we even bleed at all. \nUsing the Microgynon pill in different ways, such as continuous pill taking allows you to stop or delay bleeds as we explain below. \nDoes Microgynon stop ovulation?\nYes, Microgynon can stop ovulation by suppressing the natural hormonal fluctuations of our cycle.\nTo understand how Microgynon stops ovulation, we need to go back to the classroom and remind ourselves of the science behind the menstrual cycle.\nDuring our menstrual cycle, 2 hormones called FSH and LH increase at different times to cause an egg to mature and then be released. Microgynon stops ovulation as it contains hormones which suppress and stop the rise of FSH and LH. This means your body no longer has the hormonal triggers to ovulate (release an egg).\nBy stopping ovulation, Microgynon can help with menstrual symptoms including PMS, heavy or painful periods and conditions such as endometriosis.\nDoes Microgynon stop periods?\nIf you take the Microgynon pill correctly, the hormones found within it will prevent the womb lining from shedding in a monthly bleed. As described above, this is due to the natural fluctuations of our hormones through the menstrual cycle being suppressed.\nThe withdrawal bleeds that happen during a pill break are caused by a sudden drop in the oestrogen and progestogen you had been taking daily for at least 3 weeks. The oestrogen and progestogen stabilise the womb lining and stop any bleeding, when these hormones are removed from the body, the womb lining doesn’t have anything to keep it there so it is shed in a bleed.\nSo technically, Microgynon does stop periods, but can still cause some bleeding as withdrawal bleeds. We can use this lovely knowledge of hormones to stop and control when and if we bleed….read on to find out more.\nDoes Microgynon stop periods straight away?\nIf you start taking Microgynon during the first 5 days of your period, it will protect you against pregnancy immediately BUT won’t necessarily stop that period, you’re likely to still bleed until it would have naturally finished anyway. From then, you can take Microgynon in different ways to control or avoid bleeds in the future.\nHowever, it’s important to know that some spotting or bleeding called breakthrough bleeding is common in the first 3 months of starting Microgynon. This is as your body gets used to the new levels of hormones and the womb lining gradually thins out and stabilises. Important note – if bleeding during a packet carries on after 3 months or randomly occurs again in the future, make sure you see a healthcare professional.\nIs it normal to have no period during the pill break?\nYes, it is normal to have no bleeding during the pill-free break, although it is more common to have a bleed. This is because the action of Microgynon thins out the womb lining, and eventually, for some people, the womb lining becomes so thin that there is nothing left to shed….and so no bleeds! Again, this is perfectly safe. However, if you don’t bleed in the pill break, you might want to do a pregnancy test JUST in case. You can buy 2 Clearblue tests from Amazon (affiliate link).\n\nCan I take Microgynon to stop my period?\nYou can use Microgynon to stop withdrawal bleeds and this can be really convenient to time your bleeds around events like holidays, weddings, sexy weekends away or that big work interview. It’s completely safe to do and really easy.\nIf you use Microgynon 30, continue taking the pills nonstop without a break between packets. By doing this, you can prevent the bleeding from happening that would usually occur during your break. It’s quite popular to “tricycle” pill packets, which means taking 3 packets in a row without a break and then having a 4-7 day break for a bleed. (Remember that a 7-day break isn’t needed and you can reduce it to 4!). This has the bonus of only around 4 bleeds per year.\nIf you use Microgynon ED, you can still stop bleeds, just take the 21 yellow pills like normal, ignore the last 7 pills which are white, and move straight onto another packet.\nIf you want to bleed even less, you can even take the pill continuously without any scheduled breaks. However, this often leads to breakthrough bleeding or spotting after a while, which varies from woman to woman – it could be 3 months, could be over a year! If you do start spotting or bleeding while taking the pill packets back to back, remember Dr Fran’s rule of 4 to make things simple. If you bleed for 4 days in a row, have a 4-day break to shed the womb lining then go straight back to continuous taking. If you spot for a couple of days, you can keep continuing but as soon as it reaches 4, allow your body to shed the womb lining during a 4-day break. This method is called a tailored regime and although it is an unlicensed use, we know it is safe and can improve many contraceptive side effects. We’d like to thank Professor John Guillebaud, the first-ever professor in family planning, for revolutionising how we use the combined pill!\nIf you’re interested in Microgynon 30 or Microgynon ED, you can order the pill online.

        "Title": "Progestogen-only contraception and breast cancer &#8211; what’s the risk?",
        "Content": "\nYou may have seen the article published on BBC news ⁽¹⁾ about the new study ⁽²⁾that links the progestogen-only contraceptive methods to an increased risk of breast cancer. Let’s unpack the study and what this means for you if you’re taking the mini pill, injection, implant or hormonal coil (IUS) . \n✔️If you think this blog sound informative, make sure to check out our newsletter for more:\n\nWhat we knew about hormonal contraception and cancer\nWe already know that there is a small increased risk of breast cancer if you’re taking the combined pill – for example, Microgynon, Yasmin and Lucette, which contain oestrogen and progestogen.\nHowever, most of the research so far looking at progestogen-only contraception and breast cancer risk has been inconsistent or looked at all hormonal methods, grouping progestogen-only and combined contraception together which made it really tricky to definitively say whether or not progestogen-only methods affect breast cancer risk. \nNow finally, someone has researched progestogen-only methods! This is great news, and the results aren’t too alarming.\nWhat is the study and is it legit?\nThe study was published in the PLoS Medicine journal on the 21st of March and looked at nearly 30,000 patient records held by GPs in the UK, including almost 10,000 women under 50 years old who had breast cancer diagnosed between 1996 to 2017, and a control group….so it’s pretty legit.\nWhat does the study tell us?\nThe study revealed that similarly to the combined pill, current or recent users of the progestogen-only / mini pill, injection or hormonal coil (IUS) were found to be at slightly increased risk of breast cancer. When this data was combined with earlier published studies, the authors found a similarly elevated risk associated with the progestogen implant. There was no significant difference between the types of progestogen-only methods and their effects on breast cancer. \nThe results of the study showed that women who used any method of hormonal contraception had a 20-30% higher likelihood of developing breast cancer compared to those who did not use hormonal contraception. \nThat sounds concerning, however it’s really important to stress that the risk of breast cancer in women of reproductive age (i.e. users of contraception) is small and breast cancer is rare in younger women under 30⁽³⁾. So a 20 to 30% increased risk in this age group means a small number of extra cases of breast cancer.\nLet’s break it down: for every 100,000 women who are aged 35-39, which is the size of the population of Worcester, 265 more women who have been using oral contraceptives, so combined or progestogen-only pills, for 5 years could develop breast cancer in the next 10 to 15 years. The risk is smaller in younger women suggesting an extra 61 women per 100 000 aged 25 to 29 years old and an extra 8 women per 100,000 aged 16 to 25 years old will develop breast cancer.  \nLet’s put this into perspective: there are almost 56,000 cases of breast cancer each year in the UK of which 8% are caused by obesity and being overweight and another 8% are caused by drinking alcohol. Less than 1% are caused by oral contraceptives ⁽³⁾. \n\nWe also have to balance this against the well-known benefits of hormonal contraception, which prevent unplanned pregnancy and help manage often debilitating conditions such as heavy or painful periods, endometriosis, PMS, PCOS and acne, and which have a protective effect against womb and bowel cancer. \nAm I still at risk if I’ve stopped taking these methods?\nThe risk is likely to decline after you’ve stopped using the injection, implant or hormonal coil (IUS) and the study found that 10 years after stopping oral contraception, your risk will go back to normal.\nHopefully, this blog has explained the study further, but if you have any other questions or concerns, don’t hesitate to reach out to us or speak to a doctor.\nWhat does the study not tell us?\nThey recorded prescriptions during a defined period only meaning that they don’t have information on progestogen contraceptive use prior to the start of the observation period, making it difficult to assess the long-term impacts of contraceptive use or the total duration of contraceptive use on breast cancer risk.\nDoes the breast cancer risk change anything for you if you’re taking progestogen-only contraception?\nPreviously, there was a gap in the knowledge on the effects of progestogen-only contraception on breast cancer. However, our assumption that if there was a slight risk, it would be small, seems to be supported by the study.\nTherefore, we don’t think there’s any cause for immediate concern and it’s unlikely the findings from this study will change who can and can’t use progestogen-only contraceptive methods. For most people the benefits of hormonal contraception will far outweigh the risks.\nHowever, individuals who have current breast cancer should not use any form of hormonal contraception and those with a past history of breast cancer would usually only do so in consultation with their oncologist and cancer team. \nAm I more at risk of breast cancer on progestogen-only contraceptives, if I have a family history of breast cancer?\nEveryone has BRCA genes, which protect us against breast and ovarian cancers. Some people have a faulty BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene, meaning this protective effect doesn’t work as it should. If you know that you have a faulty BRCA gene, combined contraception is not generally advised as you are already at a higher risk of developing breast cancer. Guidance in the UK advises that progestogen only methods are generally considered safe for people with a BRCA gene mutation to use ⁽⁴⁾. This new study hasn’t changed any current guidance for women who carry the BRCA gene, but at The Lowdown, we’re going to keep an eye out and let you know if any changes to guidance are made in the future. In the meantime, if you’re worried, you can speak to a doctor for advice.\nHaving a family member with breast cancer does not necessarily increase your risk. 1 in 7 women ⁽³⁾ in the UK will be diagnosed with breast cancer so it is not uncommon to have someone with breast cancer in your family. However, if you have a significant family history of breast cancer or other cancers, or family members who have been diagnosed at a young age, speak to your doctor who will be able to advise you about the need for genetic testing ⁽⁶⁾.  \nWhy does the mini pill increase the risk of breast cancer?\nWe’re still unsure about why hormonal contraceptives increase the risk of breast cancer. However, we do know that the hormones oestrogen and progestogen can cause some breast cancers to grow. We know breast cancer risk is influenced by your lifetime exposure to reproductive hormones. In fact, factors like starting your periods at a younger age and going through the menopause at an older age can increase your risk of breast cancer. Having children and having them at a younger age can decrease the risk ⁽³⁾.\nThis blog can help you learn more about various contraception options, but it does not give medical advice. You should always speak to a nurse or doctor when making choices about contraception and before starting a new method.\n\n",

She is currently working as a salaried GP partner in Sheffield with an interest in complex medical patients and women’s health. Fran is really passionate about patient choice and wants to empower women to take control of their bodies and contraception needs.\nf you think you’ll find this blog useful, subscribe to our newsletter:\n\n\nThe Cerelle pill is a brand of progestogen only pill which is a popular choice for both its benefits and low risk to people using it. It’s currently rated as the number 1 brand of progestogen only pill by The Lowdown community.\nCerelle works by preventing your body from releasing an egg each month, thickening the cervical mucus so sperm can’t enter the womb and by thinning out the womb lining to prevent a fertilised egg implanting into the womb and forming a pregnancy. If taken perfectly, Cerelle is 99% effective at preventing pregnancy. \nCerelle is designed to be taken every single day, which should in theory make it easier to remember. However, if you miss a Cerelle pill occasionally, you’re not alone and it’s not uncommon! It’s important for you to know exactly what to do if you have missed a pill, and The Lowdown is here to help make things easier.\nDo you need to take Cerelle at the same time every day?\nIdeally, the Cerelle pill should be taken at the same time every day. This makes sure it’s working effectively and can minimise side effects such as irregular spotting or bleeding. If there is slight variation in the time you take it each day, you should still be protected against pregnancy but it’s important to understand your safe window and missed pill rules and when to seek help.\nHow late is considered a missed Cerelle pill?\nThe safe window in which to take the Cerelle pill is 12 hours. This means that you have 12 hours after the usual time you take your pill to remember it. If you are over 12 hours late to take your pill, this is a missed pill.\nWhat happens if you miss one Cerelle pill?\nMissing one day’s worth of Cerelle means that you need to follow specific instructions to avoid an accidental pregnancy. The easiest way to work out what to do is by using our simple-to-follow missed pill calculator. \n\n\nIf you have missed one pill, take it as soon as you remember, even if this means taking 2 pills on the same day. Then take your next pill at your usual time.\nFor the next 48 hours after taking the next pill, avoid having sex or use condoms to give Cerelle time to become effective again.\nIf you had unprotected sex (sex without a condom) after your missed pill OR within the 48 hours after restarting your pill, you should think about using emergency contraception such as the morning-after pill or the copper coil.\nIf you think you need emergency contraception, speak to your healthcare professional or order the morning-after pill online.\nWhat happens if you miss two Cerelle pills?\nIf you have missed two Cerelle pills, only take one as soon as you remember. You don’t need to take 2 or 3 together! Then follow the missed pill calculator or the guidance as above.\nCan you get pregnant if you forget a Cerelle pill?\nIf you forget to take a Cerelle pill, pregnancy is a possibility IF you have sex without a condom more than 12 hours after your last pill was due to be taken OR in the 48 hours after you have remembered to start taking your pill again.\nIf this applies to you, it’s really encouraged to look into emergency contraception either via speaking to your healthcare professional, local sexual clinic or buying the morning after pill.\nHow to remember to take your Cerelle pill\nThe easiest way to avoid the drama of worrying about missed Cerelle pills and emergency contraception is to have a really great way of remembering to take it every day. Some people use an alarm on their phone or watch, while others place their Cerelle pills next to something they use every day such as a toothbrush or make-up bag. It’s best to find a method of remembering that is personal to you. After a while, hopefully taking your pill will become a habit and you’ll remember without even thinking!\nIf you still find yourself missing Cerelle pills, it might be time to consider a switch. Use our recommender tool to find the best contraception for you. A common reason for people to miss a pill is by forgetting to renew their prescription and suddenly ending up without any…..we call this the “oh s**t” moment at The Lowdown.\n\n\nThe most convenient way to avoid this is to have your pill delivered automatically to your door. Order the pill online through The Lowdown to subscribe for delivery every 3, 6 or 12 months.\n",

        "Title": "What you always wanted to know about cervical screening, but didn’t know how to ask",
        "Content": "\nFirstly, what is cervical screening and why is it important?\nLots of people think that cervical screening is a test for cervical cancer, but let’s get one thing straight: it’s not! Cervical screening (which used to be known as a smear test) is a quick test to check on the health of your cervixwhat-you-always-wanted-to-know-about-cervical-screening by looking for certain strains of a common virus called human papillomavirus (HPV)¹. If you want to learn more about what HPV is and how it’s passed on, check out our HPV FAQs blog.\nThere are over 200 types (or ‘strains’) of HPV, generally categorised into ‘high-risk HPV’ and ‘low-risk HPV’. 8 in 10 people will have HPV at some point in their life², and it usually clears up on its own within 2 years³ without causing any issues. High-risk HPV can cause cell changes over time, which may lead to cervical cancer. Cervical screening works to prevent cervical cancer by checking for the types of HPV which can cause these cell changes. If high-risk HPV is detected it means keeping a closer eye on your cervix to spot any changes early, through additional screening or colposcopy, in order to prevent cervical cancer from ever developing.\nRemember: having HPV does not mean that you have, or will develop, cervical cancer. Out of 100 people having cervical screening, 87 are HPV negative and are invited back for routine screening in 3 or 5 years’ time. Of the 13 who receive a HPV positive result, 9 are invited back for a screening in 12 months time, and only 4 are referred for a colposcopy⁴. A colposcopy is an in-detail examination of your cervix which is usually performed in an outpatient gynaecology clinic.\nHow does the screening process work?\nIn England, screening is offered to women and people with a cervix aged 25 – 64. You should get your first invitation just before you turn 25. If you’re aged 25 – 49, you will be invited for a screening every 3 years (depending on your result, but more on that in a moment), and if you’re aged 50 – 64, you’re invited back every 5 years.\nAll eligible people who are registered with a GP practice as female will automatically receive an invitation by post. Trans men who were assigned female at birth won’t receive an invitation if registered with a GP practice as male. So if this is you, you are still entitled to screening if you have a cervix! Please chat with your GP as it is an important part of your ongoing healthcare.\nThere are 3 main outcomes of a cervical screening appointment:\n\nOutcome 1: ​​Your results are HPV negative (i.e. no high-risk HPV). You’ll be invited back for your next screening in 3 years (ages 25-49) or 5 years (ages 50-64)\nOutcome 2: Your results are HPV positive, but NO cervical cell changes. You’ll be invited back for your next screening in 12 months. If you get a HPV positive result with no cell changes 3 times in a row, you’ll then be invited for a colposcopy\nOutcome 3: Your results are HPV positive with cervical cell changes. You’ll be invited for further tests at a colposcopy\n\nWhy aren’t under 25s routinely screened?\nEven though cervical screening is routinely offered to 25 – 64 year olds, your first invitation letter should actually arrive 6 months before your 25th birthday. You don’t need to wait until you’re 25 to book your appointment.\nThe reason that under 25s are not routinely offered screening is because cervical cancer is very rare in under 25s. In the UK, per 100,000 women only around 4 people are diagnosed with cervical cancer under the age of 25, which is less than 1% of cases, and there is an average of 0 deaths from cervical cancer among under 25s⁵.\nResearch suggests that the risks of offering cervical screening to under 25s outweigh the benefits, as it’s common to have changes in cervical cells when you are under 25, which usually clear up on their own.\nIf you’re under 25 and are experiencing bleeding between periods, during or after sex; or any changes to vaginal discharge, speak to a healthcare professional as these could be symptoms of cervical cancer. They could also be symptoms of other conditions or STIs, so don’t panic!\nWhat stops people from going for cervical screening?\nThe Lowdown surveyed 1,171 women and people with a cervix across a range of age groups and asked them about their cervical screening experiences. We wanted to find out why some delay or put off going for cervical screening, whether they find the appointments painful or uncomfortable, and what advice they would give to others who are putting off their appointment. Here’s what we found…\n415 people answered the question, ‘If you’ve put off or delayed getting a smear test before, what are the main reason(s) why?’. The top three barriers were:\n\nWorried about pain or discomfort (39%)\nWorried about embarrassment or taking their clothes off (28%)\nForgot about it (24%)\n\n1,130 people answered the question, ‘Have you found any of your smear tests painful or uncomfortable?’. They said:\n\nNot painful, better than expected (11%)\nIt was fine (20%)\nSomewhat uncomfortable (39%) \nA little painful (18%)\nVery painful (9%)\n\nYou told us that being worried about pain or discomfort was the top barrier to delaying your appointment, so let’s bust some common myths about cervical screening. Plus, answers to a few questions we know can be embarrassing to ask, but you really want to know before going for your appointment.\nWe’ve also asked our community for their advice on making the experience as smooth as possible, as well as guidance from the experts on the other end of the speculum.\nTips to make your cervical screening appointment as comfortable as possible\nYou can ask for a smaller (or larger) speculum\nAsking for a smaller speculum is common practice, but lots of us aren’t aware you can ask for one, or even that speculums come in different sizes! We like to think of this as a quick hack to make your screening more comfortable if you need it, and just knowing that you can opt for a smaller size may already help you feel more comfortable going into your appointment room. If you’re well accustomed to asking for a smaller speculum, communicate this with your healthcare practitioner doing the screening right off the bat. You can even ask to insert the speculum yourself if this will make you feel more comfortable and relaxed.\nAlternatively, you may even want to ask for a bigger speculum – now, bare with us here. The Lowdown’s Medical Director Dr Fran says:\n\nYou can lie down in a different position\nSometimes, adjusting the way you lie down for your cervical screening makes all the difference – for both you and your clinician.\n\nUsually, you’ll be asked to bring your feet up towards your bum, placing your feet together and turned in, then dropping your legs to the side\nIf you have a ‘tilted’ cervix, you can make a fist with both hands, place them under your bum and sit on top of them to lift your cervix up\nAlternatively, you may be able to lie on your left hand side and pull your right leg up towards your chest. This is called the “left lateral” position but not all practitioners have been trained to do this so may not feel comfortable trying it\n\nYou can ask for a female healthcare practitioner\nWhile some of us aren’t bothered about who performs our screening, others may feel more comfortable if the person taking the sample also has a cervix themselves. It’s totally okay to request a female clinician if that will make you more comfortable, you won’t be offending anyone! There’s a whole host of reasons for this, which you can choose to disclose, or not. Ultimately, your comfort is the top priority in order to have a successful screening.\nWork out whether you’ll be on your period\nUsually the practice staff should check where you will be in your menstrual cycle when you call to make a screening appointment. If you’ve been invited and you know you’re due on, you may want to book in for another time. Screening can be done at any time during your menstrual cycle, however the best time to go is mid cycle. Generally, you want to avoid having it done when you will be on your period⁶ as blood can affect the sample and make it less accurate. If your bleeding is light, your practitioner may still be happy to go ahead, otherwise it’s best to reschedule.\nYou can ask them to stop at any time\nOverall, the best piece of advice we can give when it comes to cervical screening is to communicate openly with the person who will be examining you about any nerves or previous experiences you’ve had during screening that you weren’t comfortable with. This doesn’t mean that you have to divulge intimate details of past trauma or personal information. Letting them know that being touched in your genital area, or being touched in general, makes you anxious will allow your clinician to provide you with the best possible care. You can also request that the practitioner asks you for permission before touching you, or ask them to explain what they are doing as they go along.\nHow to tackle feeling self conscious\nSomething we found that stops a lot of people from attending their cervical screening appointments is fear of judgement, or being self-conscious about their vulva. The Lowdown’s Dr Fran wants to remind you that you have nothing to be worried about. She says:\n\nAt The Lowdown we often have a giggle about the fact that we hide our underwear in the heap of clothes on the chair when we go for our screenings, as if someone isn’t about to come face to face with our vulva. Just remember that the person examining you is a professional – you don’t need to shave or wax if you don’t want to, or apply any scented washes for their sake (you should generally avoid doing this anyway!). They got into this job to help people, not to become a judge for Vulva Of The Year.\nBring some home comforts\nIf only bringing your duvet everywhere with you wasn’t so impractical and generally frowned upon, eh? While you may not be able to bring all of your creature comforts to your appointment, a few simple pleasures can go a long way to help you feel more at ease and even distracted if need be. We recommend…\n\nListening to your favourite music or podcast (double up with some breathing techniques and you will be transported to your happy place)\nWear some warm socks, or a long skirt or top you can pull up to keep you warm and make you feel less exposed\nBring a friend or family member with you to calm your nerves and help advocate your needs\nA hot water bottle or a heat pad can help relax your muscles, meaning your pelvic and vaginal muscles will also be more relaxed for a speculum to be inserted\n\nI’ve never had sex – should I still go for cervical screening?\nIf you have a cervix and have had any kind of sexual or skin-to-skin contact with the genital area, you could get HPV and it’s recommended that you still attend cervical screening. If you’ve never had any kind of sexual contact, you may decide not to go for cervical screening when you are invited, but you can still attend if you want one.\nOur survey also highlighted that a few people have experienced misinformation, either from friends, the internet or even medical professionals, that going for a screening will break their hymen and ‘take their virginity’. Firstly, virginity is a social construct, and whether you are a ‘virgin’ or not does not determine your worth or mean that you should be denied vital healthcare involving cervical examination. Secondly, speculums should not cause any ‘damage’ (for want of a better word) to your hymen when used correctly. As we said earlier, you can always ask for the smallest size speculum if you’re nervous. It’s extremely common to feel this way, particularly if you’ve never experienced any kind of vaginal penetration.\nI’ve had the HPV vaccine – do I still need to go for cervical screening?\nThe NHS offers the HPV vaccination to children aged 12 and 13 at school in Year 8, and up to 25 years old through GP practices for those who may have missed vaccination in school. The vaccine protects against the most common types of HPV, but not every strain, so even if you’ve had the vaccine, it’s still important to go for cervical screening. The HPV vaccination, cervical screening and treatment for cell changes can all help prevent cervical cancer.\nWords of wisdom from The Lowdown community\nDon’t just take our word for it, here’s a few top tips from a few seasoned cervical screening veterans who took our survey…\n“Talk to your nurse! They will understand! I wore a skirt as I was uncomfortable with the idea of getting undressed and that helped heaps. My nurse also said I could listen to music if I needed to so that might help!”\n“GO! The person doing your screen does not give a damn what your genitals look like. And you don’t need to hide your knickers! Also – ALWAYS ask for more tissue and have a panty liner for afterwards, and never feel uncomfortable asking to wash your hands!”\n“Crack on, it’s not that bad and an easy thing to tick off your adult to-do list”\n“Please book your smear test – it’s quick, free and nowhere near as uncomfortable or embarrassing as you’re imagining. And it could save your life!”\n“It’s over so quickly, and is so worth it to catch anything early on and for your own peace of mind”\nHow to book your NHS cervical screening appointment\nIf you have received an invitation for cervical screening, please don’t wait to attend! It’s a 5 minute appointment that could be life saving, and really is one of the best ways to look after your health. It’s not too late to book your appointment, even if you’ve missed your last one, haven’t taken up the invitation yet or have been delaying it – you’re not on trial and won’t be judged for it!\nWe’d love for you to share this article with your friends and family who may be hesitant to book their cervical screening appointment. If you’re both due for one, why not book them at the same time and tick it off your to-do list? You could offer to go with them for support and keep each other informed of the results.\nIt’s really easy to book your appointment – simply contact your GP practice, or check if your local sexual health services offer cervical screening. If you’re waiting on previous screening results that never arrived, you can also contact your GP practice as they will be able to trace these – even if you’ve moved to a different surgery.\nGeorgia is our resident content know-it-all.

        "Title": "Can you use Yasmin as emergency contraception?",
        "Content": "\nUnprotected sex is common, whether it’s due to a missed pill, a condom split or just too many tequilas. In the moments after, you may be thinking “oh no” and start to panic about the potential of a pregnancy. If you have some Yasmin pill packets lying around, it’s tempting to wonder if these could be taken to act as emergency contraception. Can you use Yasmin as emergency contraception, is this safe and would this work to prevent pregnancy?\n👍 If you think you’ll find this blog useful, make sure to check out our newsletter:\n\nCan Yasmin be used as an emergency pill?\nThe morning after pill is used after an episode of unprotected sex (without a condom, or when other contraception failed) to prevent pregnancy. It delays the release of an egg (ovulation) which gives time for the sperm released into your body to die before it can fertilise an egg leading to a pregnancy. There are two hormones that are found in the different types of morning after pill: ulipristal acetate (which is sold as ellaOne) and levonorgestrel (which is sold as Plan B, Levonelle One Step or other brands).\nYasmin is a combined pill that contains oestrogen and a progestogen called drospirenone. When taken everyday as ongoing contraception, the combined pill works by preventing ovulation. However, taken as a one off, or just after unprotected sex will not delay the release of an egg. Therefore, Yasmin cannot be used as an emergency contraceptive pill. Not only will it not work, but taking several Yasmin pills in an attempt to prevent pregnancy would cause you to take a high and potentially harmful amount of oestrogen, putting you at risk of blood clots and high blood pressure alongside other side effects including bloating, breast pain and mood swings.\nWhat to do if you miss a Yasmin pill\nThere are different options you should take if you miss a Yasmin pill depending on how many pills you have taken, where in a packet you are or whether you back to back your pill packets (take your pill continuously without a break). We have a handy and easy to use missed pill calculator if you ever miss a Yasmin pill. This calculator can help you with the next steps after missing a pill and may suggest you speak to a healthcare professional or order the morning after pill.\n\nUsing emergency contraception\nAfter unprotected sex, emergency contraception can be used to prevent pregnancy. The copper coil is the most effective form of emergency contraception and is effective at preventing pregnancy even after you have ovulated. An emergency copper coil can be fitted by your local sexual health service. \n\nThe morning after pill can be used before you have released an egg. Most people won’t know when they ovulate (release an egg) so the pill is most effective when taken as soon as possible after unprotected sex. Alongside emergency contraception, you should consider testing for STIs if you have had unprotected sex without a condom. Even if you have used emergency contraception, you should take a pregnancy test 3 weeks after unprotected sex. Buy 2 Clearblue tests from Amazon (affiliate link)\nThe morning after pill\nThere are different ways you can get the morning after pill. You can order the pill online to be delivered to your door or it is available from most pharmacies, your local sexual health clinic or GP surgery. You may wish to read our guide on which morning after pill is the best to help you decide between the two different types of morning after pill. You can even order the morning after pill to keep a spare one for future use, as we are living in the 21st century!\nRemember to make sure the morning after pill is as effective as possible, you should take it as soon as possible after unprotected sex. You should take another morning after pill or consider the copper coil if you vomit after taking it.\nIf you are concerned about missing pills or need emergency contraception, you can order emergency contraception directly from The Lowdown, and speak to our expert medical team for more guidance on long term contraception.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of The Lowdown’s fab Clinical Directors, Dr Frances Yarlett MBBCh (Hons) BSc (Hons) MRCP (2016) MRCGP DFSRH completed her medical training from Cardiff University in 2013. She is currently working as a salaried GP partner in Sheffield with an interest in complex medical patients and women’s health. Fran is really passionate about patient choice and wants to empower women to take control of their bodies and contraception needs.\n",

        "Title": "What should I do if I miss a Hana Pill?",
        "Content": "\nThe Hana pill is a type of progestogen only pill. There are multiple different brands of progestogen only pill, and Hana is a brand that contains a progestogen called desogestrel. Hana works by stopping your body from releasing an egg from the ovary (ovulating) each month, thinning out the womb lining to prevent a fertilised egg from implanting and growing and also by thickening the cervical mucus which makes it harder for sperm to enter the womb and reach an egg.\nIf you take your Hana pill every day without fail at the same time, it is 99% effective at preventing pregnancy. However, typical use (which takes into account delayed or missed pills) means effectiveness drops to around 91%.\nIf you miss a Hana pill, the first thing to do is stay calm! To find out what to do next, you can either use our easy to follow missed pill calculator or read on to our guide below.\n\nHow late is considered a missed pill?\nThe window in which you need to take your Hana pill is 12 hours. This means that if you usually take your pill at 8am in the morning, and one day you forget it, you have until 8pm in the evening to take your pill. If you have not taken the pill within these 12 hours, it is classed as a missed pill.\n\nWhat happens if you miss one Hana pill?\nIf you forget to take your Hana pill at the correct time but remember to take it before the 12 hours have passed, you do not need to do anything.\nHowever, if you miss one Hana pill (either by forgetting to take the pill within 12 hours of your usual dose, or by forgetting to take it that day completely), you can follow our missed pill calculator for advice.\nYou should take the missed pill as soon as you remember and then take your next pill at the same time as usual. This might mean taking two Hana pills in the same day, but this is completely safe.\nIf you have missed a pill, you are not protected from pregnancy. You should avoid sex or use barrier methods (like condoms) for 48 hours after you start taking the pill correctly again. This is because it takes two days of taking the Hana pill for the cervical mucus to thicken up again and prevent sperm from entering your womb.\nWhat happens if you miss two Hana pills?\nIf you miss two Hana pills, you should take a pill as soon as you remember to and then start taking your next pill at the same time. Again, this might mean taking two Hana pills in the same day, but this is completely safe.\nIf you have had sex without a condomsince you first missed a pill, it’s very important to consider using emergency contraception such as the morning after pill.\nRemember you are not protected against pregnancy until you have used the pill correctly for a full 48 hours, and in this time you should use barrier contraception like condoms or avoid sex.\nCan you get pregnant if you miss a Hana pill?\nIf you miss a Hana pill, your body could release an egg from your ovary. As sperm can actually stay alive inside you for up to between 5 to 7 days after sex, a missed pill can lead to an unintended pregnancy.\nIf you have had unprotected sex (without a condom) after missing a pill (so more than 12 hours after your last Hana pill) then you may need emergency contraception to prevent pregnancy. Emergency contraception is either the copper coil or the morning after pill. \nThe copper coil is the most effective form of emergency contraception and can be fitted by your local sexual health clinic. You can order the morning after pill from The Lowdown to be delivered straight to your door or get this from a pharmacy or your local sexual health clinic.\nRemembering to take your pill\nThere are different ways to get into the habit of taking your Hana pill on time each day. For example, put the pill next to your toothbrush, phone charger or on your bedside table so you see the packet at the same time each day. Or, set an alarm on your phone with an annoying tune that you don’t turn off until the pill is in your mouth. Forming a regular habit to take your pill at the same time each day will make you consistent and less likely to miss pills.\nHowever, if you are missing pills frequently, it might be time to consider a change in contraception. Start by using our recommender tool to find the best contraception choice for you.\nFinally, a common reason for missing Hana pills is simply running out of your supply! With The Lowdown, you can prevent this from happening through our subscription delivery service to make sure you’re never left in that “oh shit” moment. You can order the pill online from us for next day delivery straight to your door.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of The Lowdown’s fab Clinical Directors, Dr Frances Yarlett MBBCh (Hons) BSc (Hons) MRCP (2016) MRCGP DFSRH completed her medical training from Cardiff University in 2013.

        "Title": "Can you take Yasmin while breastfeeding?",
        "Content": "\nFirstly, congratulations on your new arrival and well done for breastfeeding!\nBreastfeeding can be both an amazing, bonding experience but also a difficult journey requiring hard work, determination and luck. While you’re awake all hours of the day and applying barrier cream liberally to your nipples, you’re probably not thinking about a) sex or b) another pregnancy. However, as research suggests that at least a 12 month gap between pregnancies is preferable for both mothers and babies¹², it’s a good idea to start thinking about your contraceptive options early.\n✅ If you think you’ll find this blog informative, check out our newsletter for more:\n\nIs Yasmin safe to take while breastfeeding?\nThe Yasmin pill is one of The Lowdown’s most popular contraceptives. It is a combined pill containing both oestrogen and progestogen. Its popularity may be due to its additional non-contraceptive benefits including treatment for acne, heavy periods and PMS / PMDD. As a new parent, you may be worried about the implications of any new contraceptive on both your and your baby’s health.\nFor anyone thinking about a combined contraceptive, your medical history needs to be reviewed to check the method is safe for you. Certain personal characteristics such as your BMI, smoking history and a history of blood clots in yourself or a family member can mean combined contraceptives (like Yasmin) are less safe for you. This is due to the small increased risk of blood clots and cardiovascular disease that may be associated with combined contraception for some users. You can speak to your healthcare professional or speak to a doctor at The Lowdown for an insight into your own risk. Yasmin can interact with certain medications so it is important to let us know what other medications you take if you order the pill online.\nThe risk of blood clots is increased during pregnancy and in the first few weeks after giving birth. Yasmin can be started from 6 weeks after birth if you are breastfeeding and have no other risk factors for blood clots.4 Some women may choose to delay this start to 6 months after birth when the risk of blood clots becomes even lower.\nYasmin should not be started before 6 weeks after birth if you are breastfeeding.4 This is because in addition to an increased blood clot risk in the first few weeks after birth, some research studies suggest that combined pills including Yasmin may reduce weight gain in infants if started within 6 weeks after birth. If Yasmin is started 6 weeks after birth or later, research shows there is no effect on your baby’s weight gain and Yasmin does not affect your baby’s health or development.4\nYasmin can be taken continuously while breastfeeding and you can even order Yasmin online with a subscription to avoid the baby brain moments of running out.\nDoes Yasmin affect milk supply?\nHormonal contraceptives can be found in breastmilk, but in very small amounts (less than 1/100th of the mother’s dose). This has led to worried parents and concerns that contraceptives which contain oestrogen, such as Yasmin, may affect breastfeeding and milk supply. The most recent scientific research is thankfully more reassuring.\nLarge research studies have shown no significant difference in breastmilk composition, breastfeeding duration and infant growth between users of combined birth control and non users.5\nA summary of the scientific literature agrees that previous research indicates combined contraceptives such as Yasmin do not affect milk supply and breastfeeding outcomes overall when started 6 weeks after delivery6,7. When combined pills are started 6 weeks or later after birth, your milk supply is established. A minority of women may experience a drop in milk supply in the first month after starting a combined pill, but this is usually a transient effect. On balance, there is no evidence it affects your baby’s growth. The study also suggests that combined pill brands with an oestrogen content of 30 micrograms or less (such as Yasmin) are better choices to maintain your milk supply while breastfeeding.\nIf you have any concerns about supply or breastfeeding during your journey or after starting a contraceptive, speak to your health visitor, infant feeding team or a lactation consultant who can offer specialised advice.\nWhat other methods of contraception can you take while breastfeeding?\nBreastfeeding itself can be used as a contraceptive, which is known as the lactational amenorrhoea method (LAM). To use LAM correctly, the rules need to be strictly followed and there is research suggesting that the method is less effective in working mums3. We’re unsure how many women use the LAM method worldwide, but often women prefer to choose another reliable method.\nBreastfeeding does not limit your contraceptive choice and the majority of options can be started straight after birth. Combined contraceptives such as the combined pill, patch or ring, need to be started later at 6 weeks after birth. The progestogen only pill, injection and implant can be started any time after birth and coils can be inserted within the first 48 hours, or after 4 weeks. As always, your personal medical history should be checked before starting any form of contraceptive to make sure it is safe for you. You can read more details about your options in our blog contraception while breastfeeding. \nContraceptive choice is personal and you shouldn’t feel like you have to use the same method as before your pregnancy. We know that raising a child is hard work, which for example, may affect how easy it is to remember to take a daily pill. Furthermore, anecdotally from Lowdown users, the side effects you experience from a method that was previously really well tolerated before you conceived may alter after pregnancy. If you’re thinking of making a change, use our recommender tool to find the best contraception method for you.\n\nAs always, don’t suffer with side effects and chat to one of our doctors for specialised advice.\n\nOne of The Lowdown’s fab Clinical Directors, Dr Frances Yarlett MBBCh (Hons) BSc (Hons) MRCP (2016) MRCGP DFSRH completed her medical training from Cardiff University in 2013.

        "Title": "Can you use Microgynon as emergency contraception?",
        "Content": "\nWhat’s the lowdown?\n\nMicrogynon is a popular combined pill, however, it is NOT safe to use as emergency contraception.\nInstead, access emergency contraception such as EllaOne and Levonorgestrel via your healthcare professional or The Lowdown.\nIf you’ve missed your Microgynon pill, check our missed pill calculator to work out whether or not you need to use emergency contraception.\n\n\nCan Microgynon be used as an emergency pill?\nAn emergency contraceptive pill is used to prevent pregnancy after an episode of unprotected sex. Unprotected sex is sex without a condom or where your usual contraceptive can’t be relied upon e.g. where a condom broke or missing a pill. The morning after pill is designed to prevent ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary) meaning that any sperm dies before it has a chance to meet an egg, fertilise it and for the fertilised egg to become a pregnancy.\nThere are 2 types of morning after pill: ellaOne (which contains ullipristal acetate) and pills which contain levonorgestrel. Neither the Microgynon pill or the Microgynon ED pill contain ullipristal acetate so cannot work in the same way as ellaOne to prevent pregnancy. Although Microgynon pills do contain the progestogen levonorgestrel, this is at a dose of 150 micrograms per pill. The levonorgestrel dose which is required to delay ovulation and work as emergency contraception is 1.5 milligrams which is equivalent to 1500 micrograms. Therefore, the amount of levonorgestrel required to prevent release of an egg is 10 times that found in one single Microgynon pill.\nCan you take 10 Microgynon pills as emergency contraception?\nNo. You also have the added ingredient of oestrogen within a Microgynon pill. Taking 10 Microgynon tablets would mean you also take 10 times the recommended dose of oestrogen. Microgynon contains 30 micrograms of oestrogen. Doses above this can be associated with risks including blood clots and high blood pressure alongside other side effects including bloating, breast pain and mood swings. Due to the risk of taking a high dose of oestrogen do NOT use multiple Microgynon pills as emergency contraception as this amount of oestrogen is simply not safe for you to take.\nWhat to do if you miss a Microgynon pill\nIf you miss a Microgynon pill and have recently had unprotected sex, don’t panic, you can follow the step by step guidance in our missed pill calculator. This may be to order the morning after pill or seek advice from your healthcare professional. If you have had sex without a condom, it’s always important to consider testing for STIs.\nUsing emergency contraception\nEmergency contraception can be used to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex. The most effective form of emergency contraception is the copper coil as this can be used even after you have released an egg. The morning after pill is more effective if you take it as soon as possible after unprotected sex but may not work if you have already released an egg. It is advised to take a pregnancy test 3 weeks after the unprotected sex. Get 2 Clearblue tests from Amazon (affiliate link)\nThe morning after pill\nGetting the morning after pill is thankfully really easy. It is available from most pharmacies, your local sexual health clinic, GP surgery or you can even order the pill online to be delivered to your door the next day. There are 2 different types of the morning after pill. Please read our guide on which morning after pill is the best. The morning after pill should be taken as soon as possible after unprotected sex to make it as effective as possible. If you vomit within 2 hours of taking the morning after pill, you should take another one.\nAs we’re living in the 21st century, you can even order the morning after pill to have one in the cupboard for future use, just in case there is another Oops moment!\nOne of The Lowdown’s fab Clinical Directors, Dr Frances Yarlett MBBCh (Hons) BSc (Hons) MRCP (2016) MRCGP DFSRH completed her medical training from Cardiff University in 2013.

        "Title": "The lowdown on Natural Cycles and the Oura Ring",
        "Content": "\nIn a world first, digital contraceptive Natural Cycles have partnered with smart ring maker Oura, to make it much easier to track your fertility using your temperature. \nIf you think you’ll find this blog interesting, be sure to sign up to our newsletter for more!\n\nThe team at Natural Cycles very kindly gifted me a free Oura Ring and have spent the last few months taking it for a spin. Here’s my honest review…\nHow do you use Natural Cycles and the Oura Ring?\nInstead of having to measure your temperature every day by putting Natural Cycle’s digital thermometer in your mouth, your Oura Ring is able to measure it automatically every night whilst you sleep – and this is linked to and recorded in the Natural Cycles app.\nThe Natural Cycles app then uses their algorithm (which combines your period and cycle data with the temperature readings) to predict your daily fertility status. If you’re using it as a contraceptive, it will tell you in the app which days are ‘green’ (not fertile) or ‘red’ (use protection). Natural Cycles is a hormone free digital contraceptive that is FDA Cleared and CE Marked. \n\n \nRemind me why body temperature is important?\nAfter you ovulate, your basal body (resting) temperature rises due to hormonal changes – basically, the amount of progestogen in your body increases as you head towards your period. \nThe Natural Cycles algorithm uses this temperature rise (combined with optional ovulation tests) to detect and predict ovulation. If you want to prevent pregnancy, you don’t have sex or use condoms in the six days before you ovulate (your fertile window). It’s six days because the algorithm accounts for the day of ovulation, plus the days leading up to it that sperm can survive within the female body.\n\nHow effective is Natural Cycles with Oura Ring? \nThere is no change to the effectiveness of Natural Cycles when you’re using the Oura Ring – Natural Cycles is still 93% effective with typical use and 98% effective with perfect use. The table from our blog on contraceptive effectiveness shows how Natural Cycles compares with other contraceptive methods.\nYou can read our more detailed analysis of the app’s effectiveness and what we mean by ‘typical’ and ‘perfect’ use in our guide to how Natural Cycles works.\nFYI Natural Cycles had to get FDA Clearance again to use the Oura Ring, so it’s been through lots of testing and they conducted their own clinical study to show that it’s safe and just as effective, and doesn’t impact the way their algorithm works. \nHow much does Natural Cycles and the Oura Ring cost?\nHere’s the rub. You must purchase the Oura Ring and subscription separate from your Natural Cycles subscription:\n\nYou need a Natural Cycles subscription which currently costs £8.99 per month (if you subscribe monthly) or £59.99 for the year. (FYI Lowdown users get 15% off this here or by using the code LOWDOWN15)\nYou need the Oura Ring which costs around £250 ($299). While Natural Cycles users do receive around a £33 ($40) discount on the ring, keep in mind that you’ll be charged in U.S. dollars if you’re located in the UK and will be responsible for VAT and customs upon delivery (which cost me an extra £50)\nFinally, you must have an active Oura membership  – which costs around £6 ($6.99) per a month after their free trial. \n\nSo basically it’s around £300 upfront to deliver the ring, along with two subscriptions coming to around £130 per year. \nIt’s pretty spenny, but if you see that you could be using this method for let’s say 5 years, that works out as a cost of £930 for 5 years, £16 per month and around 50p per day. Which, if you’re using it as contraception, is much cheaper than a baby.\nI’ve spoken with the Natural Cycles team and they have said they are ‘developing new, more affordable hardware – as well as integrating with other third party options’. So this is just the first step in making this whole temperature checking thing a lot easier. \nHow accurate is the Oura Ring at measuring temperature trends?\nTo predict ovulation, you need an accurate temperature reading to the tenth degree. Oura proudly states that they can measure changes as precisely as 0.13°C (0.234°F), accurate to within 0.36°C (0.648°F); ‘this matches with research-grade tools at more than 99% under lab conditions, and 92% under real world conditions.’ Basically, it’s super accurate.\nHow often do you need to charge the Oura Ring?\nThe Oura Ring comes with this little black disk that has a USB-C charging cable attached. A fully charged Oura Ring will last up to seven days, but this depends how much you use it. Like my old Fitbit, I find myself recharging it around every 5 days.\n\nCan I shower and swim with my Oura Ring?\nYep, thankfully – otherwise it would be a pain to take it on and off to wash your hands. It’s water resistant up to 100 meters. You can do pretty much anything in it, except playing Netball as they don’t let me wear jewelry – which is a bit annoying as I miss all those precious activity steps! \nFor Natural Cycles to work, do I need to wear my Oura Ring all the time?\nYou don’t have to wear the ring all the time – you can only wear the ring overnight if you want to, and that also makes the battery last even longer! Fun fact: The Oura Ring emits a little red light when you’re asleep. \nWhat else does the Oura Ring do? Is it worth the money?\nWhilst the UI of the Oura app isn’t as intuitive as my partner’s more intense Garmin setup, it seems to do all the usual stuff. Oura was originally designed as a sleep tracker (length, stages) but you can also track your activity (steps, heart rate variability, workouts) and menstrual cycle in there (however I do that in my Natural Cycles app because I’m #loyal). \n\nWhere can I find out more info about Natural Cycles?\nAs The Lowdown we have lots of resources on Natural Cycles and every contraceptive method:\n Read real life reviews from people who’ve tried Natural Cycles\n Read more on how Natural Cycles works\n Read our complete guide to Natural Cycles \n Get Natural Cycles with 15% off\nContraceptive effectiveness data:\n1.

        "Content": "\nWhat’s the lowdown?\n\nIt’s safe to have sex during pregnancy, unless a doctor or midwife has advised not to\nIt’s so normal for your sex drive to ebb and flow during pregnancy. If you feel a mismatch between your partner’s sex drive and your own (whether or not that’s because it’s uncomfortable) just remember – communication is key!\nPainful sex can happen for various reasons, depending on the trimester you are in\nA tip is to try other sex positions and see what works for you\nIf sex is so painful that you are avoiding it, have a chat with your primary healthcare team or midwife as soon as possible. There could be an underlying medical problem, or it could be as simple to fix as learning new positions to try in the bedroom.\n\nIf you think you’ll find this blog interesting, make sure to check out our newsletter:\n\nPregnancy causes multiple changes to your body, some of which might make sex uncomfortable. In this post, we’re unpacking the most common reasons why sex might be painful during pregnancy and the things you can do to navigate your pregnancy sex life with more ease.\nHaving sex while you’re pregnant doesn’t have to be a negative experience. In fact, sex at this time is a good way to promote intimacy and mental wellbeing at a time when a lot of changes are happening in your body.¹\nHormones play a vital role in maintaining a healthy pregnancy but can also cause an array of side effects² such as nausea and vomiting, fatigue, tender breasts, low libido and other changes that might make sex uncomfortable. While these symptoms can be annoying, they are totally normal. Identifying which trimester you’re in is one way to narrow down why you might be experiencing painful sex at this time.\nBada bing bada boom! You’re pregnant. \nHere are the top causes of painful sex during the first trimester\n\nThe first trimester is weeks 1 to 12 of pregnancy.³ If sex is painful during this time it could be because of:\n1. Vaginal dryness\nRemember how the changing hormone levels tend to bring on an onslaught of other effects? When oestrogen levels drop, you may also experience vaginal dryness and/or itching.\nWhat can help: Try a hormone free vaginal gel or use a water-based lubricant for sex\n2. Uterus growth\nThe initial stretch as your womb expands to accommodate the growing baby, can mean sex feels a bit more uncomfortable at this time. This often feels like mild cramping.\nWhat can help: Book a chat with our knowledgeable pelvic health physio for advice and tips for coping with this.\n3. A full bladder\nPregnancy can make you feel you need to pee more often than you used to. The increased pressure on the bladder can make sex uncomfortable for some people.\nWhat can help: Our pelvic health physio can also provide support on this. Click here to arrange a call.\n4. An infection\nWe’ve touched on this and other common causes of pain during sex here. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as chlamydia and gonorrhoea are associated with a higher rate of complications during and after the pregnancy period and can be passed on to baby.⁴ \nWhat can help: If you haven’t had one recently then get an STI screen early on in your pregnancy, and ask your partner to do the same. This is especially important if you and/or your partner have multiple sexual partners.\n\nCauses of painful sex in the second trimester\n\nIn your second trimester (weeks 13 to 27) causes of painful sex might be:\n1. A yeast infection (thrush)\nThis is especially common during the third trimester and can cause vaginal soreness and discomfort.⁵\nWhat can help: Thrush during pregnancy can be treated with a cream or tablet inserted into the vagina (pessary). Always speak to your primary healthcare team or midwife before starting any medications while pregnant.\n2. Pelvic congestion\nIncreased blood flow to the abdomen and pelvis during pregnancy can result in enlarged veins in the pelvis. This tends to feel like pressure in the vagina or a deep ache in the pelvis particularly after sex.\n3. Round ligament pain\nThis happens when the ligaments that support your uterus (womb) start to soften and stretch as the baby grows.⁶ Round ligament pain tends to feel like a sharp pain or cramp to one side of your stomach.⁷ It is super common and not harmful to baby but it can make sex uncomfortable in certain positions.\nWhat can help: regular light exercise, warm baths, avoiding sudden movements.⁸\n4. Pelvic Girdle Pain (PGP)\nSome women experience this in pregnancy, and it is due to stiffness of the joints in the pelvis. You can read more about it here.\nWhat can help: Consider different positions for sex, such as lying on your side or kneeling on all fours. Antenatal physiotherapy can also be useful to help with PGP.\n \nPainful sex during the third trimester\n\nYour third trimester begins in week 28 and lasts until childbirth. If you experience pain during sex at this time, it could be because of the following:\n1. Swelling of your labia and vagina\nAs the pregnancy progresses and the baby continues to grow, this puts increasing pressure on the blood vessels in your abdomen and pelvis – that includes your nether regions.\n2. The weight of a heavy uterus\nThis can make sex uncomfortable in certain positions.\nWhat can help: Scroll down for some sex positions to try!\n3. Pelvic stretching\nIn the final stage of pregnancy, your pelvis widens to prepare for labour and this can make penetrative sex feel uncomfortable.\n4. Orgasms or sex itself can set off mild contractions known as Braxton Hicks\nWhile these may feel uncomfortable, they are normal and not a cause for alarm.\nWhat can help: Try to relax. Lying down until the contractions pass may also help.⁹\n\nShould I stop having sex if it hurts?\nFor the majority of people, sex is absolutely fine during pregnancy and only requires some adjustments to make it more comfortable. But there are some instances when it’s a no no. \nIf your doctor or midwife has advised that you don’t have sex, please don’t. \nThis advice could be for various reasons, such as:\n\nIf you are found to have a low-lying placenta, a condition known as placenta praevia that affects 1 in 200 pregnancies in the U.K.¹⁰ You can read more about placenta praevia here\nIf you are at risk of going into early labour or have any problems with your cervix\nIf you’ve been told you have a high risk of miscarriages\nIf you are experiencing heavy bleeding. It’s important to get this checked out ASAP at any point during your pregnancy\nIf your waters have broken, sex can increase your risk of developing an infection but most importantly, if your water breaks early (before 37 weeks) you should seek medical attention ASAP.¹¹\n\nIn summary, pregnancy is a special, complex time for multiple reasons but your sex life doesn’t have to suffer unless you are following strict medical advice. If in doubt or something doesn’t feel right, always speak to your healthcare team for clarity. And remember – being open with your partner about your discomfort and your evolving relationship with your body is vital for maintaining your wellbeing.\nTips for lovemaking during pregnancy:\nCheck out our little list for improving your sex life:\n\nLying side by side is one way to comfortably have sex during pregnancy. This can either be facing your partner or with your back to them \nCow girl, where the pregnant partner is on top, can be a great way to have sex without your growing bump getting in the way\nTry having sex with your partner penetrating you from behind. This could either be with you both standing up or with you on all fours\nUse pillows to support you where necessary!\n\n\n\nDr Silvia Anie-Akwetey is a writer, artist and GP-in-training with previous experience in Emergency Medicine.

        "Title": "Everything you need to know about Slynd: The new progestogen-only pill",
        "Content": "\n\n \n\nWhat kind of pill is Slynd? \nSlynd contains a progestogen called drospirenone. You may recognise this hormone from some combined pills including Drovelis, Yasmin and Eloine. These combined pills also include synthetic oestrogen, whereas this new pill Slynd contains only drospirenone. Other progestogen only pills (aka mini pills) contain desogestrel (Cerelle), norethisterone (Noriday) or levonorgestrel (Norgeston). \nHow effective is Slynd?\nSlynd is taken daily, and mainly works to prevent pregnancy by stopping ovulation. It also thickens the cervical mucus to prevent sperm from entering the womb and reaching an egg, and thins the lining of the womb to prevent a fertilised egg from implanting. With perfect use, Progestogen-only pills like Slynd can be more than 99% effective. \nHowever with typical use (i.e. at times forgetting to take a pill) the risk of pregnancy in the first year of use is probably around 9%¹. There are a few things that can stop the progestogen-only pill from working properly such as vomiting, some medicines, or missing a pill. Take a look at our complete guide to the progestogen-only pill to learn more about this. \nSee how the effectiveness of progestogen-only pill compares with other contraceptives:\nHow do you take Slynd?\nSlynd differs from other mini pills as there are 24 active pills in a pack which contain hormones, and 4 ‘dummy’ sugar pills.\nYou can either start the pack from day 1 of your natural menstrual cycle, and you will be protected against pregnancy straight away, or use condoms for 7 days if you start at any other time in your menstrual cycle. If you’re switching to Slynd from another pill brand or method of contraception check out our switching tables. \nWhat happens when you miss a pill?\nSlynd is an oral contraceptive pill that must be taken daily. Slynd can be taken within a 24 hour ‘safe window’ and will still be effective, similarly to the combined pill. \nOther progestogen-only pills such as Noriday and Norgeston must be taken daily within a 3 hour window. Desogestrel based pills such as Cerelle and Desomono have a 12 hour window. \nHowever, for ease it’s still recommended that you take the pill at the same time every day to reduce the chances of missing your safe window.If you do exceed the 24 hour safe window for Slynd, where a pill is taken more than 24 hours late (more than 48 hours after the last pill was taken) this is termed a “missed” pill.\nIf any active pill is “missed”, contraceptive effectiveness may be reduced. In this case follow the instructions in the pill packet on what to do next and whether to consider emergency contraction. Watch this space, we plan to update our missed pill calculator to include Slynd next year! \n\nWhat are the benefits of Slynd? \nAs mentioned, Slynd has a longer safe window than other progestogen only pills, meaning there’s more time for you to remember to take your pill each day. \nIn terms of non contraceptive benefits, there is some evidence to suggest Slynd could help reduce period pain. Similarly to other progesterone only pills, Slynd users who have left reviews at The Lowdown report it as good for periods.\nAs Slynd contains drospirenone, a newer type of progestogen with anti androgenic activity, it might help with acne or hirsutism (abnormal hair growth). Similarly, drospirenone is known to be beneficial for water retention, so may be beneficial for those who have experienced weight changes associated with this on other hormonal methods. It is important to note however that the effect of Slynd on acne, hirsutism, weight, and also mood/premenstrual syndrome has not however been specifically studied.\nOther progestogen only pills are taken continuously whereas Slynd has a 4 day ‘break’ where you take dummy pills instead of pills containing hormones.It is thought that this 24/4 regimen has less of a hormone withdrawal effect compared to 21/7 regimens in combined pills. Slynd could potentially therefore improve pelvic pain, headaches, breast tenderness, and bloating symptoms associated with the pill free break on the combined pill².\nWhat’s an alternative to Slynd?\nSlynd is different to the other mini pills as it contains drospirenone which is usually found in combined pills, but not other POPs. \nThe best alternatives would be the original progesterone-only pills which contain desogestrel such as Desogestrel, Hana and Desomono. There’s also the option of other progesterone-only pills which include norethisterone or levonorgestrel. \nThat said, all other progesterone-only pills need to be taken daily whereas Slynd is taken for 24 days followed by 4 placebo pills. However, remember that with all other progesterone-only pills they do not have the 24 hour ‘safe period’ like Slynd does and instead have a shorter safe window.\n\nIs Slynd safe?\nSlynd, like other progestogen only pills, is safe for most people to take.\nHowever, as drospirenone can increase potassium levels in your blood, you should discuss with your healthcare provider if you are on any medications that may also increase potassium levels. If you have medical problems such as kidney or adrenal disease, Slynd may not be suitable. \nReminder: The progestogen-only pill will not protect you from STIs, and there is potentially a small risk of ectopic pregnancy for those using the mini pill who become  pregnant. However, the risk is lower than if you’re not using any contraception at all³.\nWhat are the side effects of Slynd?\nPossible side effects of Slynd include acne, cramping, headaches, nausea, breast tenderness, severe vaginal bleeding, weight gain and loss of sex drive according to the Slynd guidance on their website. Evidence is too limited to confirm or exclude any causative association between POP use and headache, acne, libido, weight gain or mood⁴.\nUnpredictable bleeding is common with all types of POPs. With Slynd, ‘scheduled’ bleeding may occur when taking dummy pills (known as the hormone free interval) but ‘unscheduled’ bleeding or vaginal spotting is also common. \n\nIt’s a new pill on The Lowdown site – if you’ve used Slynd and would like to share your experience please leave a review here.\n\nCan you take antibiotics with Slynd?\nMost (but not all) antibiotics are ‘non-enzyme-inducing’ which means your contraceptive pill will continue to work just fine, for example when taking standard antibiotics for a urine or chest infection. However ‘enzyme inducing antibiotics’ such as rifampicin or rifabutin can make some forms of contraception including the pill less effective. Discuss any new medication with your doctor or pharmacist who may advise you to use alternative contraception.\nIs Slynd good for Endometriosis? \nCombined hormonal contraceptives and the hormonal coil (IUS) can be used as treatment for endometriosis and are equally effective at improving symptoms \nThe progestogen-only pill, implant and injection can also help symptoms, but aren’t considered the “first line treatment” as there has been less research into these methods.\nIs Slynd suitable for those with PCOS?\nSlynd can be safely used by people who have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) as an effective method of contraception. People with PCOS may wish to use combined contraception (containing oestrogen and progestogen) however due to the benefits of this type of people in managing acne, hirsutism (abnormal hair growth) and irregular periods which are all symptoms of PCOS. \n Can I take Slynd if I get migraines? \nSlynd, alongside other mini pills and progestogen only methods of contraception, is safe for use for those with migraines both with and without auras.\nHowever, headaches are still a recognised side effect of progestogen-only contraception and new headaches or changes to your headaches should be discussed with your healthcare professional. \n",

        "Content": "\n✅ If you think you’ll find this blog helpful, make sure to check out our newsletter:\n\nWhat is the morning after pill, and how does it work? Here’s the lowdown on what you really need to know about the morning after pill and emergency contraception, including when it will and won’t work to prevent pregnancy.\nWhen should I use the morning after pill?\nThe morning after pill can be used to prevent pregnancy in the hours or days after unprotected sex. Unprotected sex is any sex during which contraception is not used, or not used correctly, or during which contraception has failed. This could be a broken condom or forgotten pills – if your contraception has not worked or been taken as it is supposed to, the morning after pill may help to prevent a potential unintended pregnancy. The length of time you have to take the morning after pill after unprotected sex will depend on the type of pill you take. We’ll go into more detail on that in a moment, but firstly…\n\nHow does the morning after pill work?\nThe menstrual cycle\nIn order to understand how the morning after pill works, we first have to know what happens during the menstrual cycle. Our menstrual cycle 101 blog gets into the details of all the phases of your cycle, but for the purposes of understanding the morning after pill we’ll just briefly go over just the follicular phase here.\nThe first day of your period signals the beginning of the first phase of your cycle: the follicular phase. During the follicular phase, when oestrogen and progesterone levels are low, follicular stimulating hormone (FSH) rises, causing the most advanced follicle (a sack of fluid inside your ovary that contains an egg) to mature. When the follicle is big enough it produces large amounts of oestrogen which triggers another hormone (stay with us) called luteinising hormone (LH), which tells the follicle to release the egg. Voilà – ovulation!\n\nHow the morning after pill affects the menstrual cycle\nThere are lots of brands of morning after pill on the market at the moment including LoviOne, Levonorgestrel, Ezinelle, Levonelle One Step, and ellaOne. All of these pills contain a synthetic hormone called levonorgestrel, except ellaOne, which contains a hormone modulator called ulipristal acetate.\nSperm can stay alive in the female genital tract for about 5 days after sex. If ovulation occurs within those 5 days, or even just before, fertilisation could take place and you are at risk of pregnancy.\nStrangely enough, scientists still can’t agree on exactly how levonorgestrel works. We do know, however, that it delays the release of an egg (ovulation), meaning that any sperm present in the body will most likely die before an egg appears and they have the chance to fertilise it. \nThe function of ulipristal acetate, on the other hand, is clearer: it stops the normal functioning of progesterone and prevents the surge of LH (the one that tells the follicle to release its egg), and so delays ovulation. Similarly to levonorgestrel, an egg is released later on, giving the sperm time to say their goodbyes before the egg arrives!\nIt is important to mention that the morning after pill isn’t an abortion pill. This is because without ovulation, pregnancy cannot occur. Some research exploring the precise mechanisms of emergency contraceptive pills suggests that the pills could have an effect on an egg that is already fertilised. However, a judicial review in 2002 concluded that pregnancy begins at implantation (where a fertilised egg embeds itself into the womb lining). All forms of emergency contraception therefore work before implantation occurs rather than disrupting established implantation.\n\nWhen might the morning after pill not work?\nIf you take it after you ovulate:\nThis is really, really important, and is something that very few people know about. Earlier, we explained that the morning after pill interferes with the menstrual cycle and causes an egg to release later than it normally would. If that egg is already released when you have sex, however, the hormones in the morning after pill will not be able to do anything about it. Essentially, if you’re past the ovulation stage of your cycle or fertilisation has occurred, the morning after pill will not work and you may become pregnant. This is why it’s so important to do a pregnancy test 3 weeks after taking a morning after pill. Buy 2 Clearblue tests from Amazon (affiliate link)\nIf you remember, though, there’s a debate in the scientific community about the effects of the morning after pill following ovulation. So you may want to take the morning after pill, even if you think you may have already ovulated. Although the general consensus still seems to be that its primary function is to delay the release of an egg. \nIf you have a higher BMI:\nResearch has found¹ that the levonorgestrel morning after pill is less likely to work in women with a BMI of 26 or above, or if you weigh over 70kg (even with a normal BMI). Similarly ellaOne may be less likely to work if you have a BMI above 30 or weigh more than 85kg. Doubling the dose of the levonorgestrel pill has been suggested to increase the effectiveness, but another study suggests this makes no difference². The guidelines for emergency contraception³ in the UK recommend women with a BMI of 26 or above or who weigh over 70kg (and a copper coil is not suitable) should be offered ellaOne, or a double dose of the levonorgestrel morning after pill. This is something you can discuss with your doctor or pharmacist.\n\nHow long after sex should I take the morning after pill?\nLevonorgestrel, Ezinelle and Levonelle One Step must be taken within 72 hours (three days) of unprotected sex. ellaOne can be taken up to 120 hours (five days) after unprotected sex. \nSex is classed as unprotected not only if no contraception is used, but also if the contraception you are using has failed (such as a broken condom or missed pills). \nHow long does the morning after pill take to work?\nThe morning after pill should work almost immediately to delay ovulation. It is important you don’t use the morning after pill as a preventative measure – i.e. don’t think you’re safe to have unprotected sex after you’ve taken it. Sperm can survive inside your body for a few days, so having unprotected sex again after you’ve taken it could lead to pregnancy. You will need to consider emergency contraception again for any further instances of unprotected sex within the same menstrual cycle.\nHow effective is the morning after pill?\nThe earlier you take the morning after pill, the lower your chances of becoming pregnant. Remember that current advice states that the pill must be taken before ovulation in order to be effective, so the later you take it the more risk you have of ovulating and the more likely it is the pill won’t work.\nResearchers looked at all the evidence⁴ surrounding the morning after pill and found that ellaOne was more effective at preventing pregnancy than levonorgestrel containing pills. They found that 1-2% of people will become pregnant after using ellaOne, compared to 0.6-2.6% of those who take another morning after pill.\nHowever, if you’re REALLY keen to not get pregnant, less than 0.1% of people get pregnant after having the copper coil fitted as emergency contraception.\nAs we said earlier, the effectiveness of the morning after pill might be reduced if you have a high BMI. This is something to consider when discussing your options with your healthcare provider\nIf you vomit within two hours of taking a levonorgestrel containing pill, or within three hours of taking ellaOne, you will need to take another dose or have a copper coil (IUD) fitted to prevent pregnancy. \n\nThe copper coil (IUD) as emergency contraception\nMany of us aren’t aware that the MOST effective form of emergency contraception is actually the copper coil (IUD). This can be fitted up to five days after unprotected sex, and only 0.1% of people who choose this method become pregnant. An added benefit of the coil is that once it is in place, it can be left for up to ten years (depending on the brand of coil), providing an emergency solution alongside long-term contraception. Win-win!\nThe great thing about the copper coil is that if you have a regular cycle, it can be fitted up to 5 days after you have ovulated. That means that you could have had multiple episodes of unprotected sex in your cycle and still get the emergency coil fitted.\nIf there is concern about a sexually transmitted infection (STI) the clinic will offer you antibiotics at time of fitting as well as screening tests.\nAccess to an IUD as emergency contraception at your GP might be limited, but all sexual health clinics should be able to offer it to you.\n\nWhat should I expect when taking the morning after pill?\nSide effects\nMost individuals experience no side effects when taking the morning after pill, and there are no serious or long-term side effects associated with it at all. However, the NHS states that you might experience:\n\nHeadaches\nTummy ache\nChanges to your next period – we discuss this more below\nFeeling nauseous or vomiting – remember that if you vomit within two hours of taking levonorgestrel or within three hours of taking ellaOne, you’ll need to make another visit to your healthcare provider to get a second dose of the morning after pill or consider the emergency IUD.\n\nYour period may be earlier, later, lighter, heavier or more painful than usual after taking the morning after pill. This is because, when taken at the correct time, the morning after pill delays ovulation and, as a result, alters the timings of our natural cycle. This is temporary, and should only affect your next period before things return to normal. For more insight, check out our user-rated morning after pill side effects, and  reviews of the morning after pill.\n\nInteracting medicines\nThere is a large (and rather overwhelming) list⁵ of medicines that can interact with the morning after pill.\nThe NHS page for emergency contraception⁶ states that it should not be taken if you have severe asthma, take St John’s Wort, take some medicines for epilepsy, HIV or tuberculosis, take medicines for stomach acid, or are taking certain types of antibiotics. These medicines won’t make it dangerous for you to take the morning after pill, they just might make it less effective, and your dose may need to be increased.\nIf you’ve used combined hormonal contraception (i.e. the combined pill, patch or ring) or the progestogen-only pill in the 7 days prior to using emergency contraception, the effectiveness of ulipristal acetate in ellaOne could theoretically be reduced so healthcare professionals would advise you to consider the copper IUD or a morning after pill containing levonorgestrel. If you require emergency contraception because your injection, implant or coil has run out and needs replacing, check this with your doctor.\nA recent study from 202310, found that combined the morning after pill with a painkiller called piroxicam is more effective than taking the morning after pill alone. Piroxicam is an anti-inflammatory which inhibits prostaglandin production (which supports ovulation and fertilisation). Piroxicam isn’t being prescribed alongside the morning after pill yet, as more research is still needed. But, this is a cool new development though and we will keep an eye on the progress. \nIf you are at all unsure, talk to your healthcare provider about the medications that you are taking before choosing the morning after pill.\n\nHow do I know if the morning after pill has worked, and should I take a pregnancy test?\nAs the pill can affect your period, or cause spotting or bleeding, it is recommended that you take a pregnancy test three weeks after taking the morning after pill and don’t rely on your period as a sign you’re not pregnant. Remember that the pill itself can make your period late, so try not to worry if it doesn’t arrive on time. \nWhat should I do if the morning after pill doesn’t work? \nIf you do find yourself pregnant after taking the morning after pill, it can be unexpected and overwhelming. Consider speaking to someone you trust, and remember that this isn’t something you have to face alone. There are brilliant organisations and resources available to help you through and we have a thorough guide on how to manage unplanned pregnancy. The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) offers counselling if you need someone to talk to, and will go through your options with you to ensure you’re making the best choice for you. \nIf you’d rather speak to your doctor, they can also discuss the options available to you, and can refer you on to services that might be helpful, whatever you decide.\n\nCan the morning after pill make you infertile? \nThe morning after pill does not affect fertility, and there is no limit to the amount of times it can be taken. It contains exactly the same type of hormone that’s in the most common contraceptive pills like Microgynon and Rigevidon, which have been used by millions of people for several decades. There is no evidence that this hormone or the morning after pill will have any impact on your fertility or ability to get pregnant after using them.\nHow many times can you take the morning after pill in your life?\nDoctors and healthcare providers recommend that you don’t take the morning after pill too often as it’s not as reliable as ongoing contraception, which has caused rumours about its safety. In reality, the morning after pill has no long-term effects on your body, so can be used as many times as you need, and can also be used more than once in the same menstrual cycle.\nThe reason you might be advised to refrain from taking it too often is because there are other contraceptive choices available to you that are far more effective and easier to manage.\nIf your current method isn’t working for you (broken condoms or forgotten pills for example), try our contraception recommender to find something that might be more suitable for you. Or even better, book in with one of The Lowdown’s women’s health GPs! Although we don’t offer emergency appointments, our medics can give you individualised advice on ongoing contraception.\n\nHow much does the morning after pill cost?\nYou can get the morning after pill for free from most healthcare providers, such as sexual health clinics and your GP. If you go to a pharmacy, you might have to pay around £25 for levonorgestrel or £35 for ellaOne. You can order the morning after pill cheaper online from us at The Lowdown.\nRemember, there may be a delay in postage and delivery so make sure this won’t push you beyond the 72 or 120 hour window after unprotected sex in which you have to take levonorgestrel or ellaOne. And be mindful that the earlier you take it after sex the more effective it is likely to be.\nYou have to be over 18 to order with us at The Lowdown. If you are under 16, you will need a prescription from your doctor to buy levonorgestrel, but over-16s can buy it from a pharmacy without a prescription. Anyone can buy ellaOne without a prescription. The NHS provides more information about the services that offer free and paid access to the morning after pill. \nWhen can I start using the contraceptive pill after taking the morning after pill?\nIf you begin taking a contraceptive pill within the first five days of your period, you are immediately protected against pregnancy. Beginning your contraception on any other day of your menstrual cycle is called ‘quick starting’. If you decide to ‘quick start’ a standard combined contraceptive pill, you will need to use another form of contraception for the first seven days. All methods of contraception can be ‘quick started’ at any time if you’re not at risk of pregnancy, but there are rules about how long you’ll need extra cover for.\nIf you have recently had unprotected sex, you should consider emergency contraception if you want to avoid an unintended pregnancy. There may be a risk of a very early pregnancy but quick starting your contraception at this point is an option if a pregnancy test is negative. In this case you will be advised to do a pregnancy test three weeks after the last episode of unprotected sex. The available evidence shows there is no harmful effect of hormones from contraception on an early pregnancy. \nIf you have used the emergency contraceptive pill ellaOne (containing ulipristal acetate) wait 5 days before quick starting your pill (or other suitable hormonal contraception) and use condoms or avoid sex in the meantime and until your contraception method is effective (for a further 7 days if quick starting the combined pill for example).\nThere are also many great options, other than the pill for ongoing contraception – take a look at our comparison tool and reviews on The Lowdown!\n\nIn summary…\nDeciding on which contraception to use is enough of a minefield without throwing an emergency into the mix. If you’re clued up about your cycle and know when you ovulate, you might be able to tell whether the morning after pill is right for you when the moment arises. If you’re not, or you think you might be later on in your cycle – or if you just want a more effective, emergency AND long-lasting method of contraception – the copper coil is the most effective. \nThe most important thing to remember, though, is that accidents happen to everyone. When things go wrong, you’re never alone, and there are always options available to you. If you’re not sure what to do, consider talking through your options with a pharmacist or your doctor or nurse. You can also book a consultation with one of our in-house GPs to discuss your ongoing options with a contraception expert.\n\nMaddie is an English Language and Linguistics graduate who is passionate about writing.

        "Title": "Is the morning after pill safe?",
        "Content": "\nMost of us will have heard a rumour at some point in our lives about the ‘dangers’ of the morning after pill – whether that’s that you can only use it a finite amount of times, or that it could cause infertility. Well, we’re here to tell you this is just straight up wrong. But even if it doesn’t cause fertility issues, is the morning after pill completely safe to use? Here’s the lowdown…\nWhat’s actually in the morning after pill? \nLevonorgestrel-based morning after pills (like Levonorgestrel, Levonelle, Ezinelle and Plan B) contain the same type of synthetic progestogen hormone as the most common contraception pills, like Rigevidon and Microgynon. Levonorgestrel is a hormone that has been used in contraception for decades by millions of people around the world. In the morning after pill, progestogen is used to delay ovulation (the release of an egg ready for fertilisation), although scientists can’t agree on exactly how it works. Either way – we know it works.\nOn the other hand, ellaOne contains ulipristal acetate, which is actually a ‘synthetic, selective progesterone receptor modulator with a partial progesterone antagonist effect’¹. This basically means that it stops the normal functioning of progesterone in the body to prevent the surge of luteinising hormone (the one that tells the follicle to release an egg), thus delaying ovulation.\nIf we compare the amount of progestogen in the Levonelle morning after pill to the Microgynon combined pill and Cerazette mini pill, Levonelle contains 10 times as much progestogen than Microgynon, and 20 times more than Cerazette. While this dose seems much higher, it’s important to remember that this higher dose is needed as the pill is taken as a one-off to temporarily delay ovulation to prevent pregnancy, rather than as a daily pill.\n\n     View this post on Instagram           \nA post shared by The Lowdown (@get.the.lowdown)\n\nCan the morning after pill make you infertile?\nI’ll cut to the chase: no, the morning after pill will not make you infertile. It temporarily delays ovulation to prevent pregnancy, but there’s plenty of evidence to say that it has no long-term effect on fertility. The contraceptive pill also delays ovulation but over a longer period of time, and there’s no evidence to suggest this affects fertility once you stop the pill either.\n\nAre there any dangerous side effects of the morning after pill?\nThere are no dangerous side effects of the morning after pill. There are some potential minor side effects listed for the morning after pill, all of which are temporary and should not be severe²:\n\nHeadaches\nStomach ache\nChanges to your menstrual cycle. It could be earlier, later, shorter, longer, heavier or lighter.\nDizziness\nNausea and/or vomiting – if you vomit within 2 hours of taking Levonorgestrel, or 3 hours of taking ellaOne, you should take another dose or have a copper IUD fitted as vomiting can make the morning after pill less effective\n\nIf any of these symptoms persist after a few days, or feel severe, speak to a healthcare professional.\n\nSome Lowdown users have also reported a low mood after taking the morning after pill, but it’s really difficult to study this and factor in other reasons for mood changes after taking the morning after pill. At the time of writing, there are 21 reviews for the morning after pill on The Lowdown (across all brands). Out of these, 48% of reviewers reported a negative mood, but again, if related to the one off dose of hormone in the pill this should only be temporary.\nIs it bad to take the morning after pill more than once?\nThe morning after pill is not bad for you, and you can take it as many times as you need without any long term adverse effects, but you should not rely on it as an ongoing form of contraception. This isn’t because it’s unsafe, it’s simply just not as reliable or effective as other forms of contraception.\nWe have a more detailed guide on how many times you can take the morning after pill, but here’s a quick lowdown of the facts…\n\nYou can take both types of morning after pill as many times as you need to – it’s a myth that you can only take it 2 to 3 times a year or in your life \nYou can even take the morning after pill more than once in the same menstrual cycle – if you do, it’s recommended that you use the same type of pill each time³\n\nIf you are taking the morning after pill more than once in the same menstrual cycle, or you’re later on in your cycle and there’s a chance you may have ovulated in between taking these separate doses, consider having a copper coil (IUD) fitted as it’s the most effective form of emergency contraception. The copper coil works up to 5 days after you’ve already ovulated and as a bonus works as ongoing contraception.\n\nIs it dangerous to take more than one morning after pill?\nThere are some instances where you may be advised to take two doses of the levonorgestrel morning after pill (aka Levonelle, Ezinelle, Plan B). This could be for anyone with a higher BMI or if you’re taking other medications (which we’ll come to in a sec).\nYou should always stick to the dose advised by your doctor or pharmacist as a general rule, but it’s unlikely that you’d need to seek medical advice if you take one more morning after pill than needed. If you do, you may feel nauseous or experience some vaginal bleeding⁴.\nRemember: taking more morning after pills than you need doesn’t mean you’re more likely to prevent pregnancy. It could actually have an adverse effect as you may end up vomiting, which can make the morning after pill less effective. If you vomit within 2 hours of taking levonorgestrel pills, or within 3 hours of taking ellaOne, it’s advised that you take another dose or have a copper IUD fitted.\nIs the morning after pill safe to take when breastfeeding?\nIf you’re breastfeeding, you can use a levonorgestrel-based morning after pill³. The current UK guidelines for taking ellaOne (which contains ulipristal acetate) during breastfeeding say that while you can use this type of pill as emergency contraception, breastmilk should not be given to your baby for the following week; so pump and discard the milk to maintain supply³.\nIf you’ve just had a baby and want more guidance, check out our guide to contraception after giving birth and breastfeeding, written by our own Dr Fran.\n\nIs it safe to take the morning after pill alongside other medications?\nThere are some medications⁴ that are not recommended for use alongside the morning after pill, but this is not because it’s dangerous or unsafe, it’s just that they could potentially make the morning after pill less effective. If you are using medication for severe asthma, epilepsy, HIV or tuberculosis, stomach acid, are on certain antibiotics, or use St John’s Wort, it’s recommended that you use the copper IUD as emergency contraception. If this isn’t suitable, use the levonorgestrel morning after pill⁵. Make sure the person prescribing your morning after pill is aware of any medications you use, including hormonal contraception and over the counter remedies.\n\nGeorgia is our resident content know-it-all.

        "Content": "\nTo understand how the morning after pill affects your menstrual cycle, let’s quickly dive into how both the morning after pill and the menstrual cycle work. This is just an overview, but you can find more details in our guide to emergency contraception, and our blog on how the menstrual cycle works.\nHow does the menstrual cycle work?\nThere are three distinct phases of the menstrual cycle:\n\nThe follicular phase, which takes place before ovulation. When you start your period, this is the start of the follicular phase (we’ll dig into this shortly)\nOvulation, where a follicle (a tiny bag of fluid in an ovary containing an egg) releases a mature egg which moves into the fallopian tube ready to be fertilised. It stays alive for 12-24 hours, then is flushed out of the body if it doesn’t bump into a sperm (fertilisation)\nThe luteal phase, which happens after ovulation. Hormones work on thickening the lining of the uterus in preparation for a fertilised egg to implant and begin to break it down if fertilisation hasn’t occurred, which leaves the body as a period, beginning the follicular phase and the whole thing starts over again.\n\n\nFor the purposes of learning how the morning after pill affects your menstrual cycle, we just need to focus on the follicular phase. So, your period has started, meaning the follicular phase has begun. Oestrogen and progesterone levels are low, so the follicular stimulating hormone (FSH) does its thing. Rising levels of FSH cause the most advanced follicle to mature, growing big enough to produce large amounts of oestrogen, which triggers the luteinising hormone (LH). It’s LH’s job to let the follicle know it’s time to release the egg, moving into the ovulatory phase.\nThe morning after pill, when used correctly, interrupts this phase in a particular way. Which leads us to…\nHow does the morning after pill affect your menstrual cycle?\nThe primary function of the morning after pill is that it delays ovulation, so fertilisation between a sperm and egg cannot occur. Levonorgestrel-based morning after pills like Levonorgestrel, Levonelle, LoviOne, Ezinelle and Plan B work in a slightly different way to ellaOne, but ultimately they both work to delay ovulation.\nSperm can stay alive in the female genital tract around 5 days after sex. So if ovulation occurs within those 5 days, or just before, you could be at risk of pregnancy as fertilisation may occur\nSo, to use the morning after pill correctly you need to be at the point of your menstrual cycle where you haven’t yet ovulated. If you take it after ovulation, it’s highly likely that it won’t work. This isn’t to say that you shouldn’t take it, or that you will become pregnant, but you may need to seek alternative emergency contraception in the copper coil (IUD).\nBecause the morning after pill delays the ovulatory phase of your menstrual cycle, this can have a knock on effect on when and how your next period arrives…\n\nHow does the morning after pill affect your period?\nA common side effect of using the morning after pill includes a temporary impact on your menstrual cycle. It can be longer, shorter, heavier, lighter, earlier or delayed… you get the jist. All of these changes should only last for one cycle before your period returns to what is normal for you.\nWhen studying the bleeding patterns after using the levonorgestrel morning after pill, researchers found that out of 232 participants, 14% experienced irregular bleeding, changes in menstrual cycle length, period length and menstrual appearance compared to the usual characteristics of their period¹. Another study found that only irregular bleeding occurred in only 5% of women in the first cycle after taking the morning after pill⁴.\nIrregular bleeding that’s out of the ordinary for you following a one off dose of the synthetic hormone in the morning after pill is likely due to a breaking down of the lining of the womb, which can lead to bleeding and spotting². This bleeding shouldn’t be excessive or prolonged, so if you’re bleeding heavily after using Levonorgestrel, Levonelle, Ezinelle, Plan B or ellaOne morning after pills, speak to a healthcare professional to make sure there’s no other underlying cause.\n\nDoes the morning after pill delay your period?\nAs with most contraception, everyone is different. Some people will experience no changes to their menstrual cycle after using the morning after pill, some will find theirs is quite different from their usual length or heaviness of flow.\nOne study³ of 544 participants looked at vaginal bleeding after taking a single dose of the levonorgestrel morning after pill and 69% found that their period was early, while 21% found their period was delayed by more than a week. Another smaller study⁴ found that taking levonorgestrel in the first 3 weeks of the menstrual cycle caused periods to arrive earlier, shortening that menstrual cycle. In contrast, the length of their first period after taking the pill increased the later in the cycle the pill was taken and was longer in participants who used the morning after pill than in those who did not⁴.\n\nAs the morning after pill delays ovulation, this can mean your next period may arrive later than usual. So, if your next period hasn’t turned up when it was supposed to – don’t panic. Always take a pregnancy test 3 weeks after using the morning after pill, even if you do get your period on time, to make sure it’s worked. You can buy 2 Clearblue pregnancy tests from Amazon (affiliate link).\nOther side effects of the morning after pill include⁵:\n\nHeadache\nStomach ache\nNausea\nVomiting – just like the contraceptive pill, this can make the morning after pill less effective. You will need to take another dose if you’ve vomited within 2 hours of taking levonorgestrel and 3 hours of taking ellaOne. Or, consider having a copper IUD fitted\n\nDoes the morning after pill affect your hormones?\nYou don’t have to worry about the morning after pill messing with your hormones. There are no long-term side effects on your body or fertility from using the morning after pill. It’s safe to use and any changes to your menstrual cycle or physical side effects are temporary.\n\n\nGeorgia is our resident content know-it-all.

Most people won’t experience side effects from the morning after pill, and for those that do, they are mild and short lived. According to the NHS¹, common side effects of the morning after pill can include:\n\nHeadache\nStomach ache\nChanges to your period: it can be heavier, lighter, earlier, later or more painful than usual\nNausea or vomiting – vomiting can reduce the effectiveness of the morning after pill. You will need to take another dose if you’ve vommed within 2 hours of taking levonorgestrel and 3 hours of taking ellaOne. Or, consider having a copper IUD fitted\n\nAll of these side effects are temporary. Changes to your menstrual cycle after using the morning after pill are common as it delays ovulation, which will alter the timing of your natural cycle. This should only affect your next period, after which, your cycle will return to normal.\n\nDoes the morning after pill make you bleed?\nSome people do report light bleeding (that isn’t caused by their usual menstrual cycle) or spotting when using the morning after pill. One study looked at bleeding patterns after using the levonorgestrel morning after pill, like Plan B.² Of 232 participants 14% experienced irregular bleeding as well as changes in menstrual cycle length, period length and menstrual appearance compared to what was normal for them.² \nBleeding may be because the lining of the womb sheds irregularly following a one off dose of the synthetic hormone in the pill, which can lead to bleeding and spotting.³\nIf you do find yourself bleeding, Modibodi or WUKA period pants are a great item to be able to put on and feel reassured that any bleeding isn’t visible!\nIt’s important to remember that the morning after pill is NOT an abortion pill (abortifacient), so any bleeding that occurs after taking the pill is not due to miscarriage. The morning after pill delays ovulation – and without ovulation, you can’t get pregnant.\nIf you do experience heavy bleeding or prolonged bleeding after using Levonorgestrel, Levonelle, LoviOne, Ezinelle, Plan B or ellaOne, speak to your healthcare provider as there may be another underlying cause.\n\nIs spotting normal after taking the morning after pill?\nIt’s not uncommon to experience irregular spotting after taking the morning after pill, but this should only be temporary and last until your next period². 21% of Lowdown reviewers said they experienced spotting after using the morning after pill, and 25% reported no change at all. If you experience spotting or bleeding that’s heavy, excessive or doesn’t stop, speak to your GP.\nHow to tell if the morning after pill has worked\nIf you have spotting or bleeding after using the morning after pill, or have a period, this does not automatically mean that you are not pregnant.\nIt’s best to take a pregnancy test 3 weeks after you use the morning after pill to see if it’s worked, instead of relying on your period alone. You can buy a Clearblue pregnancy test from Amazon to be sure (this is an affiliate link),\nLikewise, as the morning after pill can make your next period later than usual, don’t assume that it hasn’t worked if your period hasn’t arrived!\nYou can use our missed pill calculator if you are worried or unsure:\n\nIf you want to know more, check out our complete guide to the morning after pill and emergency contraception.\n\nGeorgia is our resident content know-it-all.

        "Title": "The most common side effects of contraception",
        "Content": "\nLike most forms of medication and drugs, contraception can have various side effects from changes to your menstrual cycle to acne or mood swings. However it’s not a one size fits all approach. One person’s experience is likely to be very different from your own. It all depends on the method you use, your medical history and other factors such as your weight, age and lifestyle. \nIt’s worth noting that not all contraceptive side effects are negative. Some people experience improvements to their skin, periods and conditions such as PMDD, whereas others report worsening symptoms. Deciding whether or not these side effects outweigh the benefits of your chosen method is up to you.\nIn this blog we’ll discuss some of the common side effects of contraception to help you understand which method might be best for you. \nNeed help choosing the right method? Take The Lowdown’s quiz ‘What Contraception Is Best for Me’ which will recommend methods to suit you based on your preferences and medical history.\nBleeding\nPeriods, or a lack of, are an indicator of pregnancy – so it makes sense that contraception (which protects against pregnancy) would affect your menstrual cycle. Here is how the most common types of contraception impact bleeding.\nCombined hormonal contraception \nCombined hormonal contraception (the combined pill, patch or vaginal ring) is often very good at controlling bleeding. If you have heavy or painful periods, unpredictable cycles or want to control when you bleed, this may be the method for you.\nTraditionally, the combined pill is taken for 21 days, followed by a 7 day break. During this time you can usually expect a light and predictable bleed, otherwise known as a withdrawal bleed. With combined methods, you also have the freedom to choose to have fewer bleeds, or none at all, by taking more than one packet of pills without a break or taking your pill continuously – which is perfectly safe to do!\nSome people may experience breakthrough bleeding – bleeding while you’re still taking the pill or are using the patch or ring and not during a break. This can range from small amounts of spotting to bleeding like a period. Breakthrough bleeding can be annoying and unpredictable but usually resolves around 3 months of starting combined hormonal contraception.\nIf you don’t see any improvements after this time, you may wish to discuss switching your pill brand or method with a healthcare professional. Changing to a different combined pill with a higher oestrogen content, or switching to the vaginal ring, may help to make breakthrough bleeding more manageable. If breakthrough bleeding starts after you have been using combined hormonal contraception for several months, see your healthcare professional.\nProgestogen only contraception \nProgestogen only contraception includes the progestogen only pill (mini pill), injection, implant and hormonal coil. These can all have a variable effect on your cycle, making you much less in control of when and how much you bleed.\nFirstly, you may have no bleeds at all, otherwise known as amenorrhoea. The number of women who experience amenorrhoea is different with each form of progestogen only contraception. After 12 months, you can expect that 50% of people using the desogestrel based progestogen-only pill, 50% using the contraceptive injection and 20% of people using the implant will not have any bleeds. \nOne user of The Lowdown shared: “I have been taking this pill for 5 years every day. When I first started this pill, I had a light period consecutively for the first 3 months, but I haven’t had a period, pains, or cramps since. Sometimes I get the odd spotting.”\nAnother reviewed: “I was hopeful my bleeding pattern would settle down, but after 6 months I was still getting spotting or a light bleed every 4-5 days. I also struggled with a low mood, loss of sex drive, dizziness, nausea and hot flushes!” \nYou may also experience prolonged bleeding (bleeding that lasts more than 14 days) or frequent bleeding (where bleeding or spotting happens 6 or more times over 3 months). Prolonged bleeding (those annoying periods that last for over 2 weeks) can occur in 20% of women using the progestogen only pill or the implant, whereas frequent bleeding happens in around 10% of people using the desogestrel based progestogen only pill and less than 10% of people using the implant. \nOne third of women using traditional progestogen only pills (Micronor, Noriday or Norgeston) will have a change in their bleeding patterns, with frequent or irregular bleeding being the most likely. Women are less likely to have prolonged bleeding or amenorrhoea with these pill types. \nUnfortunately there’s no way of telling which path you’ll go down, but it’s worth sticking to your method for 3-6 months to give it a fair chance.\nThe hormonal coil can cause prolonged and unpredictable bleeding or spotting for up to 6 months after insertion. The good news is that at 12 months, this normally comes to an end, with many women having no bleeding at all. Mirena and Levosert typically offer better control when it comes to bleeding compared to Kyleena and Jaydess which release a lower amount of progestogen.\nIUD (copper coil)\nThe IUD (copper coil) is often associated with longer, heavier and more painful periods, so it’s best to avoid this method if you already have these symptoms. We’re not sure why this happens, but it’s thought to be down to mild inflammation caused by the copper being released into the uterus. Symptoms aren’t normally permanent and can improve after 6 months. You can also control pain with painkillers and prescription medication available from your GP.\nBleeding problems can be frustrating, so make sure to visit your GP or sexual health service if you’d like to make a switch, particularly if your bleeding pattern suddenly changes after being stable for some time. You’ll be checked for any other causes for the bleeding problems including pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections or changes on the neck of the womb called the cervix. If no other cause for the change in bleeding is found, there are medical treatments which can help manage bleeding problems. This may include changing pill brands or being prescribed more hormonal treatment. Please discuss your options with your GP or sexual health service to enable you to continue your chosen method.\nMood\nMost of us experience changes to our mood throughout the month – and not just due to hormonal highs and lows. Because of this, and the many other factors that can affect your mindset (such as work, stress and relationships) it’s very difficult to research the effect of hormonal contraception on mood. \nHere’s what we do know… scientific research suggests that synthetic progestogen may be associated with feelings of irritability and depression, whereas oestrogen may increase anxiety. But despite many attempts to research the link between mood and contraception, the results often give opposite answers – confusing we know.\nSome research studies suggest that hormonal contraception can worsen mood, while others suggest it can improve mood by treating conditions such as Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) or Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). There is no clear evidence that hormonal contraception causes depression.\nWhat’s clear is that it’s important to recognise that some women will experience mood changes on hormonal contraception and it’s important to discuss these feelings with your healthcare professional.\nIf you do experience feelings of low mood or anxiety, these may get better after the first 3 months of starting a new method whilst your body adjusts to the new hormones. If these feelings do not go away, consider switching your contraceptive. For example, a hormonal contraceptive with a lower amount of progestogen such as the hormonal coil (IUS) or a non-hormonal option like the copper coil (IUD) may impact your mood less. \nIf you experience mood swings while using combined hormonal contraception, combined pills that contain a lower level of oestrogen or taking the pill continuously without breaks may help. There is also research to suggest that certain pill brands including Yasmin, Lucette, Eloine and Zoely can have less effect on mood. \nIt’s important to be aware of your mental health and to take care of it. If you have any concerns about your mood or anxiety, tell somebody and get help from a healthcare professional.\nWeight gain\nWomen gain weight naturally with age, and many lifestyle factors can influence our weight from our diet to our movement and stress levels. Just like our mood, this can make it difficult to gain an accurate measure of how much contraception impacts weight. \nForms of hormonal contraception could cause weight changes, but for most methods, research has not identified a formal link. The injection is the only form of contraception where research has proven an association with weight gain. This is more likely if you start the injection under the age of 18 and your BMI is over 30. But most women will not experience this.\nResearch has concluded that overall combined hormonal contraception, the progestogen only pill, hormonal and copper coils and the implant do not cause weight gain. Despite this, a small number of women may still experience abnormal weight gain whilst using hormonal contraception (but again, it could also be down to their lifestyle or influencing factors).\nChanges in weight may be due to water retention which is a known side effect of synthetic hormones. This is less likely to happen with newer progestogens in certain pill brands. There isn’t much research to determine if hormonal contraception increases appetite or increases the deposit of fat cells in the body, although these are often used as explanations for weight gain on contraception.\nWhen starting a new hormonal contraceptive, you can monitor your weight for the first 3 to 6 months and discuss any changes that concern you with your healthcare professional.\nSex drive\nSex drive or libido are terms used to describe interest in and desire for sex or sexual activity. There are tons of things that can impact your sex drive, from your lifestyle, culture and day to day mood to psychological or physical problems including illnesses and the effects of medications. There is very little research into whether hormonal contraception can directly affect sex drive, however, it is a frequently reported side effect at The Lowdown.\nCombined hormonal contraception taken continuously without a break may be better for sex drive than having regular breaks. Progestogen only contraception can indirectly lower your sex drive by causing side effects such as vaginal dryness, low mood or irregular bleeding. \nBoth the hormonal and copper coils (IUDs) don’t affect sex drive in the majority of women, however, a small number of women with the hormonal coil may experience a loss of drive. Research has shown that the coils seem to either improve or not affect sex drive or sexual function in the majority of women. \n“Much lighter periods. Had some emotional times & very low sex drive but unsure if that was the IUD or the post-pregnancy life.” – The Lowdown user\nAs sex drive is influenced by many different factors, switching contraceptive is only one part of addressing an issue with this. Vaginal moisturisers or vaginal oestrogen cream can be used to treat vaginal dryness. A pelvic health physiotherapist can help with gynaecological conditions that cause painful sex whereas your GP and local mental health service can help treat low mood. If sex drive still doesn’t return to what was normal for you before you started contraception, then speak to your healthcare professional about switching your method.\nAcne\nAcne is a really common skin condition that affects both women and men well into adulthood. And one recommended treatment is combined hormonal contraception.\nCombined hormonal contraception \nMethods such as the combined pill, patch and vaginal ring contain oestrogen which have been shown to reduce acne. Because of this, some people are prescribed certain pill brands including Microgynon or Rigevidon to clear up their skin even if they don’t need contraception. There’s not much research on which brand is best but other brands including Yasmin, Lucette and Dianette which contain a progestogen called drospirenone are thought to be the most helpful.\n“I was prescribed Yasmin mostly because I suffered from acne on my face and back. I tried so many routes to get rid of it but the only thing that worked was Yasmin.” – The Lowdown user\nProgestogen only contraception \nProgestogen only contraception (progestogen only pill, implant, injection and hormonal coil) can worsen acne – this is because it doesn’t contain any oestrogen. If your skin worsens after starting progestogen only contraception, consider continuing for 3 to 6 months as your skin may improve in this time. \nIf acne symptoms are affecting you, see your pharmacist or GP as they can offer acne treatment allowing you to stay on your contraception or switch to a different brand or method.\nSo there we have it, a quick, but hopefully helpful rundown of the most common side effects of contraception. Despite being used by 44% of women of reproductive age worldwide, there is still limited research into the side effects of contraception and how best to predict, manage or avoid them. \nIf you are experiencing any symptoms and want to explore switching or trying a new method, make sure to discuss your side effects with your GP or sexual health service who can suggest better methods for you. You can also use the experiences of thousands of other women available at The Lowdown to find the right fit or speak to a women’s health doctors who specialise in contraception advice. \n\nThis blog can help you learn more about various contraception options, but it does not give medical advice. You should always speak to a nurse or doctor when making choices about contraception and before starting a new method.\nOne of The Lowdown’s fab Clinical Directors, Dr Frances Yarlett MBBCh (Hons) BSc (Hons) MRCP (2016) MRCGP DFSRH completed her medical training from Cardiff University in 2013. She is currently working as a salaried GP partner in Sheffield with an interest in complex medical patients and women’s health. Fran is really passionate about patient choice and wants to empower women to take control of their bodies and contraception needs.\n",

        "Title": "Which morning after pill is best for me?",
        "Content": "\nWhat are the different types of morning after pill?\nThere are two different morning after pills, each containing a different type of synthetic hormone. The type and dose of morning after pill that will be best for you will depend on things like; how long ago you had unprotected sex, your BMI, and whether you use hormonal contraception. We’ll talk more about these in a second, but here’s a super quick overview of the different types of morning after pill…\n\nLevonorgestrel morning after pill (also known as Levonelle, Ezinelle or Plan B): this contains the synthetic hormone levonorgestrel and can be taken up to 72 hours (3 days) after unprotected sex\nellaOne morning after pill: this contains the synthetic hormone ulipristal acetate, and can be taken up to 120 hours (5 days) after unprotected sex\n\n\n\nFor the lowdown on levonorgestrel and ellaOne, check out their contraception pages or get stuck into our guide to emergency contraception, which explains exactly how they work in more detail.\nWhich morning after pill is more effective?\nThe morning after pill works by delaying ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary). The earlier you take the morning after pill after unprotected sex, the better the chances are of it being taken early enough to delay ovulation and lower your chances of becoming pregnant. If used correctly, studies suggest the morning after pill is around 97-98% effective at preventing pregnancy.⁵ \nResearch¹ shows that the ellaOne morning after pill is more effective at preventing pregnancy than levonorgestrel-based morning after pills, with only 1-2% of users becoming pregnant after using ellaOne, compared to 0.6-2.6% of people who take a different morning after pill.\nIf you vomit within 2 hours of taking a levonorgestrel morning after pill, or within 3 hours of taking ellaOne, the effectiveness of the pill will be reduced and you will need to take another dose. Alternatively you will need to have an emergency copper coil (IUD) fitted to prevent pregnancy, which is actually the most effective form of emergency contraception – less than 0.1% of people who have one fitted after unprotected sex will get pregnant.\nThe effectiveness of the morning after pill may also be reduced if you have a higher BMI, which we’ll come on to in a moment. This is something to consider when discussing your options with your healthcare provider.\n\nWhich morning after pill is the best if you have a high BMI?\nA 2015 study² found that levonorgestrel-based morning after pills are less effective for individuals with a BMI of 26 or above, or weighing over 70kg even with a normal BMI. Some research³ has suggested that doubling the dose of levonorgestrel increases effectiveness, while another study⁴ suggests this doesn’t make a difference. Either way, the current UK guidance for emergency contraception⁵ recommends that if the copper IUD isn’t suitable and you have a BMI of 26 or over, or weigh over 70kg, you should use ellaOne, or if this isn’t suitable then a double dose of levonorgestrel.\nSimilarly, ellaOne may be less effective if you have a BMI above 30, or weigh more than 85kg.⁵ Again in this case, consider an emergency copper IUD which is not known to be affected by weight or BMI. You can still use ellaOne, or double dose levonorgestrel if this is not suitable. A double dose of ellaOne is not recommended.⁵\n\nWhich morning after pill is the best if you use hormonal contraception?\nIf you’ve used either the combined pill, patch, ring or progestogen-only pill in the last 7 days before taking the morning after pill, the best morning after pill for you to use would be levonorgestrel-based pills. This is because the hormones in these contraceptives can reduce the effectiveness of the ulipristal acetate in ellaOne.\nIf you require emergency contraception because your injection, implant, hormonal coil (IUS) or copper coil (IUD) has run out and needs replacing, speak to your healthcare provider about the best morning after pill for you.\n\nWhen can you start hormonal contraception after using the morning after pill?\nIf you have taken the levonorgestrel morning after pill, you can start any form of long term hormonal contraception immediately after taking it.\nIf you have taken ellaOne, you will need to wait 5 days before starting hormonal contraception, as the progestogen found in hormonal contraception can stop ellaOne from working as effectively. Avoid sex or use condoms during this time, plus the number of days that takes your contraceptive to start working.\n\nWhich morning after pill is best if you use other medication?\nThere are quite a few medications⁶ that can interfere with the effectiveness of the morning after pill – but this doesn’t mean you can’t use it. It’s important that you tell your healthcare provider – GP, nurse or pharmacist – about any other medications you may be taking, even herbal over the counter remedies. Particularly if you have severe asthma, use epilepsy medication, have HIV or tuberculosis, are on certain antibiotics, use St John’s Wort or take medication for stomach acid.⁷ ellaOne may not work if you’re already taking one of these medicines but levonorgestrel can still be used. Your healthcare professional may advise increasing the dose.⁷\nIf you’ve made a decision on which morning after pill is best for you, but aren’t quite sure how to get it, check out our complete guide to getting the morning after pill, or buy it directly from The Lowdown in a few clicks.\n\nGeorgia is our resident content know-it-all.

        "Title": "How many times can you take the morning after pill?",
        "Content": "\nIf you think this blog will be helpful, make sure to check out our newsletter!\n\nYou may have heard myths such as you can only take the morning after pill three times in your life, or that it’s harder to get pregnant if you’ve used the morning after pill. Let’s get one thing straight: this is just not true. Here’s what you do need to know…\nHow many times can you take the morning after pill?\nThere is no limit to the amount of times you can take the morning after pill, or how often you can take it. The morning after pill is safe to take; as both the levonorgestrel and ellaOne morning after pills have no long term effects on your body, and won’t cause any fertility problems. However, healthcare professionals don’t recommend taking it too often, as it’s simply not reliable as an ongoing contraceptive method. LoviOne is a brand of levonorgestrel based morning after pill that you can view here.\n\nThere are plenty of contraception options available that are far more effective and easy to use, whether you want to use hormonal contraception or not. If you are currently using a contraceptive, but find that it’s not working out well for you, e.g. you keep forgetting to take your pill, the patch irritates your skin or you just don’t get on with condoms, try our contraception recommender tool to help find a method that may work better for you, or book an appointment with one of our women’s health GPs for personalised advice on ongoing contraception options that can be used in the short or longer term.\n\nCan you take the morning after pill twice in a menstrual cycle?\nYes, you can take the morning after pill multiple times during one menstrual cycle. However, there are a few things to be mindful of…\nThe morning after pill likely won’t work if you’ve already ovulated. The first time you take it during a menstrual cycle it may successfully delay ovulation. If you take it again later during the same cycle, ovulation may have occurred. You may want to consider getting the emergency copper IUD, as this is the most effective method of emergency contraception and can be fitted up to 5 days after ovulation.¹\nIf you’ve already used ellaOne or a levonorgestrel morning after pill once or more in a cycle you can use the same type of morning after pill again in the same cycle.¹\n\nHowever if you’ve used ellaOne, levonorgestrel should not be taken in the following 5 days as in theory they could interact and the effectiveness of ellaOne could be reduced\nIf you’ve used levonorgestrel within the last 7 days and then use ellaOne, the effectiveness of ellaOne could theoretically be reduced \nIn these situations consider a copper coil, or if this isn’t suitable, the same type of morning after pill as used previously in the cycle can be used again. Your healthcare professional can discuss this with you\n\n\nA listed side effect of the morning after pill is temporary changes to your menstrual cycle, including spotting. Your period may be earlier, later, lighter, heavier or more painful than usual after taking the morning after pill. This is because it delays ovulation which can alter the timing of your natural cycle. This should only affect your next period before things return to normal. To learn more about how the morning after pill actually works, check out our guide to emergency contraception, and our blog on how the morning after pill can affect your menstrual cycle.\nWe always recommend taking a pregnancy test 3 weeks after using the morning after pill to make sure it’s worked. You can buy a Clearblue test from Amazon to be sure (affiliate link).\nThe morning after pill can cause light spotting, as well as the changes to periods mentioned above, so don’t rely on getting your period as the only sign that you’re not pregnant.\n\nCan you take too many morning after pills?\nTaking more morning after pills than the dose advised will not mean that you are less likely to get pregnant. In fact, it’s more likely to make you feel nauseous and/or vomit. Vomiting reduces the effectiveness of the morning after pill and if you vomit within 2 hours of taking a levonorgestrel pill, or within 3 hours of taking ellaOne, then you will need to take another dose or seek out other emergency contraception like the copper coil (IUD).\nIt’s unlikely that you’ll need to seek medical advice if you take one more morning after pill than you need, but you may feel sick or experience some vaginal bleeding.²\nIn some circumstances healthcare professionals may advise you to take two doses of the levonorgestrel morning after pill, for example where individuals have a higher BMI, or are taking other medication.\n\nCan the morning after pill make you infertile? \nNo, the morning after pill will not make you infertile. It has no effect on fertility, all it will do is delay ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary) if taken before this has occurred naturally. Most morning after pills contain the same type of hormone that’s in the most common contraceptive pills. Neither this hormone, or the morning after pill, will impact on your ability to conceive after using them.\n\nGeorgia is our resident content know-it-all.

        "Title": "Buying the morning after pill: a complete guide",
        "Content": "\nWhether you’ve never taken the morning after pill before, or are in a situation where you’re unable to get it via your usual route, here’s the lowdown on where, how and who can buy the morning after pill so you can make a quick and informed choice – time is of the essence, after all.\nFirstly, what are the two types of morning after pill?\nWhich morning after pill you should take depends on a few factors, like when you last had sex, your BMI and whether you’re using ongoing contraception or other medications. You can check out our guide to emergency contraception for more information on each of these pills and how they work, but here’s a super quick overview:\n\nLevonorgestrel (also known as Levonelle, LoviOne, Ezinelle or Plan B), which contains a synthetic hormone called levonorgestrel and can be taken up to 72 hours (3 days) after unprotected sex\nellaOne, which contains a synthetic hormone called ulipristal acetate, and can be taken up to 120 hours (5 days) after unprotected sex\n\n\n\nNot sure which of these will work best for you? We’ve created a super quick guide to choosing the best morning after pill for you to make sure you’re getting the most effective treatment.\nWhere can you get the morning after pill?\nYou can get both types of morning after pill from a few different places, either for free or paid for¹. If you want to get the morning after pill for free, you can go to either your GP or local sexual health clinic. This is a great option for those on a budget, or who’d like the chance to ask further questions with a healthcare professional in a private setting. An unfortunate downside to these options is that it can be difficult to get an appointment in the time that you need, or to take time out of your schedule to get there.\nYou can also buy both types of the morning after pill over the counter at any pharmacy. Be prepared to have a slightly awkward conversation with a pharmacist in front of a line of other customers. There’s absolutely no shame in getting the morning after pill (literally who cares what everyone else thinks!), but if you want a bit of privacy, ask if they have another room you could chat in.\nIf you can’t get to your GP or clinic, want a more discreet option, or want to avoid the waiting rooms, you can buy the morning after pill online right here at The Lowdown! No more taking time out of your day to get to an appointment, as we’ll deliver directly to your door the next day. Not only that, but you’re also able to buy an extra dose for future use, just in case you need it.\n\nHow much is the morning after pill?\nAt The Lowdown, we sell the Levonorgestrel morning after pill for the lowest price possible, at just £9.50.\nThe price of ellaOne can vary between pharmacies, costing up to £35. At The Lowdown, ellaOne costs £27. It’s more expensive, but it is more effective at preventing pregnancy.\nWho can get the morning after pill?\nIf you are under 16 years old, you will need a prescription from a doctor to get the morning after pill, so will need to go to your GP or sexual health clinic to get it.\nIf you’re over 16, you are able to buy the morning after pill over the counter without the need for a prescription. You must be 18 years or older to buy the morning after pill with The Lowdown. The morning after pill is safe to take whether you are under or over 16.\n\nCan you buy the morning after pill for someone else?\nTechnically someone else, like a friend or partner, can buy the morning after pill for you (or vice versa) but it’s not advised. While there is no law against buying the morning after pill for someone else, including no official regulation against men buying the morning after pill²; a pharmacist has a duty of care towards their patients.\nThis means they will very likely want to talk to the person who intends to take the morning after pill, as they need to ask a series of questions to determine which pill may work best for them, whether the morning after pill is suitable, depending on various factors like weight, medical conditions or other medications taken, or whether they may need alternative emergency contraception like the copper coil (IUD).\nWhen buying the morning after pill using an online pharmacy, like The Lowdown, you will need to purchase the morning after pill for yourself. Our pharmacists will review your answers to our short questionnaire to confirm which type of morning after pill is suitable for you.\n\nHow to ask for the morning after pill\nWhen buying the morning after pill, or getting it from your GP or sexual health clinic, you’ll be asked a series of questions. Here’s what you’ll usually need to tell them:\n\nWhy do you need it? (Did your condom break, did you miss a pill, etc)\nWhen did you have unprotected sex?\nWhen was the first day of your last period?\nDo you use regular contraception?\nYour height and weight (to determine your BMI)\nHave you given birth or had a miscarriage, abortion or ectopic pregnancy in the last 21 days?\nAre you currently breastfeeding?\nDo you have any medical conditions or allergies?\nDo you take any other medications including over the counter remedies?\n\nStill got questions about the morning after pill?

        "Title": "Drovelis explained: the lowdown on the new combined pill",
        "Content": "\n✅ If you think you’ll find this blog interesting, check out our newsletter:\n\nWhat is Drovelis?\nA new type of combined pill has just been launched in the UK! It’s called Drovelis (which is a questionable name) and it’s basically like our highest rated pills Yasmin and Lucette, but it’s made with a new type of oestrogen called Estretrol. \nIs Drovelis available in UK? \nYes, it was announced in October 2022 that Drovelis is now available in the UK. It is still being added to the BNF (British National Formulary) which may take a couple of weeks, but once it’s on there healthcare professionals should be able to prescribe Drovelis.\nIs Drovelis the same as Yasmin and Lucette?\nDrovelis¹ is similar to Yasmin and Lucette in the sense that it contains 3mg of the same type of progestogen, called Drospirenone. This is a fourth-generation progestogen (the latest model!) and is made from a ‘spironolactone’: a class of drugs with a range of uses that have an anti-androgenic effect in the body. This is why some people who use these types of pills report improved skin. Learn more in our guide to Drospirenone. \nThe major difference between Drovelis and pills like Yasmin is that it contains a new type of oestrogen that has never been used in hormonal contraceptives before. Most combined contraceptives contain an oestrogen called ethinylestradiol, but Drovelis contains estretrol.\nDrovelis is also similar to Eloine – which is also a low oestogen, monophasic 28 day pill.\n\nEdit\n\n\nPill brandOestrogenProgestogen\n\n\n\n\nDrovelis14.2mg Estretrol3mg Drospirenone\n\n\nYasmin30mcg Ethinylestradiol3mg Drospirenone\n\n\nLucette30mcg Ethinylestradiol3mg Drospirenone\n\n\nEloine30mcg Ethinylestradiol3mg Drospirenone\n\n\n\n\nHow do you take Drovelis?\nDrovelis is also different from Yasmin in that it comes in a packet of 28 pills, whereas Yasmin and Lucette come in 21 pill packs. In the Drovelis pill packet there are 24 ‘active’ pills which contain hormones, and 4 ‘inactive’ placebo pills, which don’t contain any hormone. If you take the tablets according to the instructions, then you may have a withdrawal bleed, like a period, which will begin during the placebo days. There is the option to shorten or avoid this bleed by reducing the number of placebo days or omitting them altogether.²\nDue to the inclusion of placebo pills, Drovelis has slightly different rules if you miss one (compared to standard combined pills), so make sure you consult your pill packet instructions for what to do if this happens. You take each 28 day pack back to back, without any break between packs.\nHow many pills are in a Drovelis pack?\nMost combined and progestogen-only pills are sold in a box of 3 pill packets, so normally they would last you around 3 months, depending on whether you take the pill packets continuously. Unusually, Drovelis is sold in a box containing a single 28 day pill packet, meaning one pack only lasts you 28 days. \nWhat are the benefits of Drovelis?\nDrovelis is made with a new type of oestrogen called Estretrol which is a synthetic (man made) version of a substance produced by the fetal liver and present in the blood of pregnant women. \nEstretrol is 10 to 20 times less potent than ethinylestradiol, so researchers are going to monitor people using this new pill over the next 7 and half years to see if it reduces the instances of side effects like blood clots.\nAs you may know, thrombosis and blood clots are very rare but potentially life threatening side effects from using combined hormonal contraceptives. Learn more about this in our guide to blood clots and contraception.\nHow effective is Drovelis?\nLike other combined pills, Drovelis works by stopping ovulation. Studies¹ have shown that it’s as effective as other combined hormonal contraceptives like the combined pill – so around 93-99% effective. This is the estimated % of people who would not get pregnant whilst using this method of contraception during the first year of using it,  taking into account typical use. Check out our guide to learn more about the clinical effectiveness of each contraception method.\nIs Drovelis safe?\nDrovelis was authorised for usage across the EU in March 2021, it has just taken a while longer to make it available in the UK as it needed to go through our medicine regulatory body. Like all new drugs, Drovelis has gone through years of clinical trials and tests to ensure it is safe to put on sale in the market and all the available evidence suggests that it is as safe to use as other combined hormonal contraceptives. \nDrovelis will be closely monitored now it’s being used more widely to see if it is safer than other hormonal contraceptives. \n\nWhat are the side effects from Drovelis?\nLike many other combined pills, the Drovelis patient information leaflet lists the most common side effects (which may affect up to 1 in 10 people) as changes in mood and libido, headache, tummy pain, nausea, acne, breast pain, painful periods, irregular bleeding and weight fluctuation.² \nAs it’s a new pill we’ve only just added it to The Lowdown site – so if you’ve used Drovelis and can share your experience please leave a review!\nCan I take Drovelis if I can’t take the combined pill? \nNo, the guidance is still the same for Drovelis which is a type of combined pill. If you can’t take the combined pill (the pill with oestrogen and progestogen in it) then you won’t be able to take Drovelis.\nCan I take Drovelis if I have migraines? \nIf you suffer from migraines with aura, then Drovelis (and other combined pills) will be unsuitable, due to a very small increased risk of stroke. If you have migraines without aura consult with your doctor to discuss your options. \nIs Drovelis suitable for those with PCOS?\nCombined pills are recommended as a form of contraception if you have PCOS as it is a way to induce a more regular bleeding pattern and help manage symptoms such as acne, hair loss and hirsutism.  \nDo I have to be under a specific BMI to use this pill?\nDrovelis is a type of combined contraception and therefore its use is technically restricted depending on a person’s body mass index (BMI). The Faculty of Reproductive and Sexual Healthcare (the FSRH are the clever people who make the rules about contraception in the UK) state that if a woman’s BMI is over 35, the risks of using combined contraception outweigh the benefits. This is because the risk of a blood clot in the legs or the lungs rises as BMI increases and combined contraception increases this risk further.\n\nAlice set up The Lowdown in 2019 with a mission to help transform the minefield that is  contraception.

        "Title": "Periods on the pill &#8211; are they real or fake?",
        "Content": "\n✅ If you think you’ll find this blog interesting, why not subscribe to our newsletter for more?\n\nReligiously sticking to the ‘21 days on and 7 days off’ ritual of the pill is second nature for many women. But this often comes with the common misconception that the seven-day break allows for the no-surprise, regular-like-clockwork period.  \nBut with updated guidance recommending the continuous use of the pill without the need for a break, confusion surrounds what this monthly bleeding is actually all about! So, if it isn’t a period, what is it?\n\nSo… what is a period?\nLet’s start off by going back to basics. We often talk about a typical cycle of 28 days. Whilst this is in fact the average, a normal cycle can range from 21 to 35 days. The luteal phase, which occurs after ovulation, typically lasts between 10 and 16 days.\nEach month your body readies itself for pregnancy, with the thickening of the lining of the uterus (aka womb) in preparation for a fertilised egg. When this doesn’t happen, the uterus sheds its lining. This is your period and day 1 of your cycle.\nOvulation usually occurs around day 14 of the menstrual cycle. Whilst we can generally assume a regular monthly cycle to be an indication of ovulation – the process in which an egg is released from the ovaries – this is not necessarily always the case.\nAnovulation is the term used to describe the lack of ovulation within a cycle. The most common reason for anovulatory cycles is when you’ve just started menstruating or leading up to the menopause (where periods stop altogether). Other conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome can cause anovulatory cycles. \nIt’s interesting to note that external factors can affect whether you ovulate. Besides oestrogen and progesterone – the main players in the menstruation game – the pituitary gland offers its skills to the mix; namely producing luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). This gland is controlled by hormones from the hypothalamus in the brain, which reacts to experiences and threats placed upon us, deciding if this month is the right month to become pregnant. \nIllness, weight loss, and disruption in sleep patterns can all be perceived as negative situations by the hypothalamus which controls the menstrual cycle, thus preventing the release of an egg: a remarkable evolutionary feature or a judgemental biological bystander? Maybe a bit of both!\nOccasional anovulation will often go undetected but if you’re not using hormonal contraception and are experiencing erratic, infrequent periods or no periods at all over a few months then speak to your doctor. \n\nWhy do we have periods?\nPeriods and fertility are inextricably linked. Oestrogen and progesterone are hormones that play a vital role in periods and the all-round health of a woman. Dr Jerilynn Prior spoke to The Lowdown’s founder Alice and discussed this in more detail in our webinar; the lowdown on periods.\nAre periods on the pill real?\nThe bleeding you experience on the combined pill, if you have a pill free break between pill packs, is called withdrawal bleeding and is a response to the withdrawal of the hormones in the pill – hence the name! This is what we mean by a fake, or false, period.\nOne of the ways hormonal contraceptives work to prevent pregnancy is by thinning the lining of the womb, known as the endometrium, by reducing its growth. It’s this effect that impacts the bleeding and often results in lighter withdrawal bleeds on the pill-free break versus the bleeding experienced during a period.\nThe reduced growth of the endometrium is why monthly bleeds are no longer necessary and why withdrawal bleeding cannot be used as a reliable indicator that you’re pregnant. (More on this later.)\nIt’s important to remember that if you do decide to take a break from the combined pill, it should be no longer than 7 days as any longer may mean you ovulate, reducing its contraceptive efficacy.\n\nSo, periods on the pill aren’t real. Does that matter?\nNo! In fact, for some women, ‘fake’ periods are better! Hormonal contraception can offer a solution to women who are plagued by heavy or painful periods. ‘How contraception can help with heavy and painful periods’ gives more info on this. One user of The Lowdown who is currently taking the combined pill Rigevidon wrote:\n“I suffer from very heavy periods normally and it’s made them much lighter and less painful.”\nCombined contraceptive methods (the pill, patch and ring) can also offer flexibility around if and when you want to bleed, see our guide on continuous pill taking. Although bleeding on progestogen-only methods including the mini-pill and the implant are generally unpredictable.\nLong-term use of combined hormonal contraceptives does not have any impact on long-term fertility. So it can be a win-win all round.\n\nDoes the mini pill stop periods?\nYes. your periods will stop. In fact, this is true for most hormonal contraception. But that’s in the technical sense, as hormonal contraception disrupts the menstrual cycle you may no longer have ‘true’ periods. This is the case if you’re taking the most common types of the progestogen-only pill, or mini pill which stop you ovulating.\nYou may however still experience bleeding whilst on the mini pill in the form of breakthrough bleeding. As with the combined pill, the lining of the uterus thins as a result of the progestogen. Bleeding on progestogen-only methods can be unpredictable for some or stop altogether for others. \nThose taking the combined pill may also experience breakthrough bleeding, especially if taking the pill continuously. The pill is still working as an effective contraceptive if you are taking it reliably. If you’ve taken the pill for 21 days or more consecutively, a short break of up to 7 days where you have a scheduled bleed may improve any breakthrough bleeding. Read more in our continuous pill taking blog here. \nBut remember: do not take a break from the mini-pill unless you’re prepared for a break in contraceptive protection. The mini pill and combined pill view breaks in very different ways. Think: the Ross and Rachel of the contraceptive world!\n\nDoes a light or normal period on the pill mean I’m not pregnant?\nIf the question is ‘I’m experiencing bleeding, can I be pregnant?’, well, yes, you could be.\n\nIt all comes back to the differences between a period, withdrawal bleeding, and breakthrough bleeding. A period is all about the preparation for pregnancy: if the egg released has not been fertilised, the lining of the uterus is shed alongside the unfertilised egg.\nBut withdrawal and breakthrough bleeding are different to a normal period and are often lighter and less frequent. Bleeding during pregnancy can also occur, and may for example be caused by implantation bleeding – where the developing embryo attaches to the wall of the uterus – or changes to the cervix (the neck of the womb) caused by pregnancy. If spotting occurs, it may be mistaken for withdrawal or breakthrough bleeding. Investing in some period pants, such as WUKA or Modibodi, could help you feel more secure going about your day without worrying about spotting.\nThe moral of the story? If in doubt, check it out! If you suspect you may be pregnant, a simple pregnancy test is the easiest way to find out. And consult your doctor if you’re experiencing any unusual bleeding that is causing you concern. Spotting whilst on the pill or during pregnancy can be entirely normal, but it may also be a sign of something more serious.\nFor further advice, why not book an appointment with one of our doctors here at The Lowdown?

        "Title": "Can I change the time I take my pill?",
        "Content": "\n✅ If you think this blog will be helpful, you should check out our newsletter for more:\n\nMaybe you’re jetting off on holiday, going travelling, or realised that your mornings are always taken up by meetings, lectures or other time sucking tasks. Whatever the situation, you might find yourself wanting to change the time you take your pill so you have one less thing to worry about.\nAdvice on how to do this differs depending on whether you’re taking a combined pill (containing progestogen and oestrogen) or the progestogen-only pill. And then, which type of progestogen-only pill.\nWe’ve removed the hassle of working it out in our go-to guide to changing your pill time, but firstly, use our contraceptive pages, to double check which type of pill you are on.\n\nWhat are pill ‘safe windows’?\nFirst a bit of housekeeping. In this blog there’s going to be a lot of talk about ‘safe windows.’ Basically, all pills last for a certain duration, and these timeframes differ depending on which pill type you’re taking. \nEveryone is advised to take their pill around about the same time each day. If you deviate from this time (but it’s still within the safe window for that pill type), it is classed as a ‘late pill.’ As long as you then take your pill within the safe window, you’ll still be protected against pregnancy, and this is what allows you to change the timings of your pill. \nOn the other hand, a ‘missed pill’ is where the timeframe in which you haven’t taken your pill exceeds the safe window for that particular pill. This means that you may not be protected against pregnancy. If you’re worried about accidentally missing a pill whilst you’re away or transitioning to a new pill taking time, you can check out our missed pill calculator. Here at The Lowdown you can order the morning after pill as a spare for future emergencies.\n\nI’m on a combined oral contraceptive pill \nHow do I change the timings of the combined pill?\nThe safe window for this type of pill is 24 hours – i.e. you need to take your pill within 24 hours of the time that you should have taken your pill (or within 48 hours of taking your last pill). However, it is important to consider the type of pill that you’re taking, as Daylette, Eloine, Qlaira and Zoely require a different approach.\nSo, just to visualise…you’ve decided to hit a morning yoga class and therefore you want to switch your pill time from 8am to 7pm. This is comfortably within the 24 hour window that you should be taking your pill (being a 11 hour time difference). All you need to do is take your pill at the new time and continue to do so. No extra contraception required!\n\n\nThe safe window for the combined pill is 24 hours\n\n\nAnd on a related note, don’t worry, even if you exceed the 24 hour window and miss one pill in your pack, or start a pack one day late, you’re still protected against pregnancy. This makes changing timings much easier. There is only a risk of pregnancy once you exceed a window of 48 hours or more, beyond when you should’ve taken your pill.\nMonophasic or multiphasic pills \nA really brief moment on monophasic and multiphasic pills. If, when trying to change the time of your pill you end up missing a pill entirely, it’s worth knowing that some pill types administer hormones in different levels throughout your cycle. \nMonophasic, which is the most common pill type, maintains a constant level of hormone for 21 days, plus you can then have a pill free break of up to 7 days if you choose. Multiphasic pills (also know as phasic) contain different hormone amounts. This can change the recommended advice around missed pills, and the specific order in which you take your pills is more relevant in multiphasic pill types. \nIn this case if you miss a pill you should carefully read the patient information leaflet that came with your pill. If you are still unsure, use condoms and speak to your pharmacist or GP. Alternatively, one of our doctors could give you advice. \n\nI’m on a progestogen-only pill (AKA POP or the mini pill)\nThe POP works by thickening the cervical mucus, as a barrier to prevent the sperm reaching the egg and thinning the lining of the womb, which stops a fertilised egg from implanting. It’s worth noting progestogen-only pills containing desogestrel or drospirenone can also stop ovulation, so there are different time frames in which you need to take each pill. Missing just one progestogen only pill can reduce the effectiveness and may mean you’re at risk of pregnancy.\n\nHow do I change the timings of a mini pill?\nThere are effectively three types of progestogen-only pill, the traditional ones containing levonorgestrel or norethisterone (think Micronor or Noriday), desogestrel pills (such as Cerazette or Cerelle) and the newer pills containing drospirenone (such as Slynd). Traditional POPs have a 3 hour window, versus a 12 hour window for desogestrel pills and 24 hour window for drospirenone pills. Confused? Read on…\nI’m on a traditional mini pill\nFor effectiveness, you must take the pill within a 3 hour window else it is considered a missed pill (but to be on the safe side, let’s consider 2 hours for this example)…\nSo, say you normally take the pill at 10am and you decide at the beginning of the week that you want to switch to 6pm instead:\n\nMonday: take pill at 10am\nTuesday: take pill at 12pm\nWednesday: take pill at 2pm\nThursday: take pill at 4pm\nFriday: and like magic take the pill at your new time of 6pm!\n\nOk it’s not lightning speed, but this is the best way to maintain consistent contraception. To switch sooner, you can always use condoms as a back-up form of contraception until you have been taking the pill for a full two days at your new time.\n\n\nThe safe window for older POPs is 3 hours\n\n\nI’m on a desogestrel mini pill\nAs long as you’re not exceeding 12 hours later than your usual pill taking time, you can freely switch the time of day you take your pill.  Beyond 12 hours, you could follow a gradual approach, similar to the above but using windows less than 12 hours, or use backup contraception for 48 hours following the change of timing.\nSo, say you want to switch from 7am to 10pm on a desogestrel-POP. Here’s how your week might look:\n\nMonday: take pill at 7am\nTuesday: take pill at 6pm (choosing an 11 hour gap to fit comfortably within the 12 hour safe window)\nWednesday:  take pill at new time of 10pm\n\n\n\nThe safe window for Desogestrel mini pills is 12 hours\n\n\nI’m on a drospirenone mini pill\nThe safe window for this type of pill is 24 hours – i.e. you need to take your pill within 24 hours of the time that you should have taken your pill (or within 48 hours of taking your last pill). Therefore if you want to switch your pill time from 8am to 7pm this is comfortably within the 24 hour window that you should be taking your pill. All you need to do is take your pill at the new time and continue to do so. No extra contraception required!\n\nBirth control pills and time zone changes \nIf you’re lucky enough to be on your travels, the most straightforward advice is to keep a note of your usual time zone and take the pill at that time. So, if you are travelling to San Francisco (where there is an 8 hour time difference from the UK) and you usually take your pill at 4pm at home, take your pill at 8am while Stateside. \nIf this means you’d have to wake up way too early or late you can always use the advice above to change your pill time to a new one, for while you’re away. If the change is within a safe window as explained above, depending on your pill type, changing the time taken will also be fine. \nWhat about when the clocks go forward?\nThe same logic applies to when the clocks go forward or back as the seasons change. A one hour difference doesn’t matter, so your pill effectiveness will not be altered. That means you can continue taking your pill at the same time you usually do.\n\nSide effects from changing the time of pill\nIt’s perfectly safe to change the time of the pill, but you might experience some minor side effects. For many, bleeding patterns won’t change but some people can experience spotting. Of course, pregnancy is a potential side effect if you don’t get the timings right, so for peace of mind you might decide to use condoms whilst you transition timings. For further advice, you can book an appointment with one of our friendly women’s health GPs.\n\nEmma is a Pharmacology & Physiology graduate with a huge passion for women’s health.

        "Title": "The Lowdown pill &#8216;groups&#8217; explained",
        "Content": "\nMany contraceptive brands contain exactly the same hormonal ingredients as each other, but are simply branded with a different name. This is because once a contraceptive drug or product has been around for a long time it is made ‘off license’ which means it can be produced and marketed by lots of different companies. So, to help them stand out, all these different companies each give the same drug a different name, which just confuses everyone!\nThe Lowdown’s combined pill groups\nTo make it easier to understand the differences between all the combined pills, we put them into groups below. We’ve grouped the brands of combined pill based on the type and level of oestrogen, as well as the type of progestogen. For more information on each of these brands, check out their contraceptive pages, and browse our contraception reviews.\nGroupOestrogen typeOestrogen levelProgestogen typeProgestogen androgenicityBrand names1EthinylestradiolLowLevonorgestrelAndrogenicMicrolite2EthinylestradiolLowDesogestrelLess androgenicMercilon, Gedarel 20/1503EthinylestradiolLowGestodeneLess androgenicFemodette, Millinette 20/75, Sunya 20/754EthinylestradiolLowDrospirenoneAnti-androgenicEloine5EthinylestradiolMediumLevonorgestrelAndrogenicLevest, Microgynon 30/75, Microgynon ED, Ovranette, Rigevidon, Maexini6EthinylestradiolMediumDesogestrelLess androgenicGedarel 30/50, Marvelon, Cimizt7EthinylestradiolMediumGestodeneLess androgenicFemodene, Femodene ED, Katya 30/75, Millinette 30/758EthinylestradiolMediumDrospirenoneAnti-androgenicYasmin, Lucette9EthinylestradiolHighNorethisterone (1mg)AndrogenicNorimin10EthinylestradiolHighNorethisterone (0.5mg)AndrogenicBrevinor11EthinylestradiolHighLevonorgestrelAndrogenicLogynon12EthinylestradiolHighNorgestimateLess androgenicCilest, Lizinna, Cilique13EthinylestradiolHighCo-cyprindiolAnti-androgenicDianette14MestranolCan’t compareNorethisteroneAndrogenicNorinyl-115Estradiol valerateCan’t compareDienogestUnknownQlaira16Estradiol hemihydrateCan’t compareNomegestrolAnti-androgenicZoely17Estetrol monohydrateCan’t compareDrospirenoneAnti-androgenicDrovelis\n\nWhat does low, medium and high oestrogen mean?\nTraditionally every pill used the same type of synthetic oestrogen (ethinylestradiol) in varying concentrations. However, some newer pills contain a different type of oestrogen – the change in side effects from this are still being investigated. Your healthcare provider can change your pill brand according to the concentration of ethinylestradiol (low 15 to 20mcg, medium 30mcg or high 35mcg) based on side effects you may be experiencing. \nFor example, a pill with a higher concentration of ethinylestradiol may help control bleeding more effectively and stop breakthrough bleeding. However, if you experience symptoms including bloating, breast pain, nausea, headaches or low libido, you can try to reduce oestrogen content using another brand to see if these improve. You can read more about this in our guide on what ethinylestradiol is and how it works.\nWhat does progestogen androgenicity mean? \nThe progestogen part of the combined pill can also cause an individual’s side effects to vary. Progestogen (or progestins) can be classed as “more androgenic” or “less/anti androgenic”. This means they have a greater or lesser effect on the male hormone (testosterone) receptors within the body. More androgenic progestogens can be associated with side effects such as acne and mood change. Anti-androgenic progestogens in combined pills may reduce libido and have a higher risk of blood clots. Check out our guide to androgens to learn more about this.\nBrands of pill in the same group have the same hormonal ingredients and should theoretically be no different. You could also switch between brands in different groups and not notice any change in side effects, whereas others may be sensitive to the level of oestrogen or the type of progestogen.\n\nGedarel vs Microgynon\nBrandOestrogenOestrogen levelProgestogenAndrogenicityGedarel 20/150EthinylestradiolLowDesogestrelLess androgenicGedarel 30/150EthinylestradiolMediumDesogestrelLess androgenicMicrogynonEthinylestradiolMediumLevonorgestrelAndrogenic\nWhen it comes to side effects, 69% Lowdown reviewers reported tender breasts when using Gedarel 20/150, compared to 63% on Gedarel 30/150, and 50% on Microgynon.\nOur data also shows that Gedarel 30/150 caused 59% of our reviewers to experience vaginal dryness, whereas only 50% of those using Gedarel 20/150, and 38% using Microgynon experienced this.\n\nBrevinor vs Microgynon\nBrandOestrogenOestrogen levelProgestogenAndrogenicityBrevinorEthinylestradiolHigh oestrogenNorethisteroneAndrogenicMicrogynonEthinylestradiolMedium oestrogenLevonorgestrelAndrogenic\nLowdown reviewers using the Brevinor combined pill have experienced higher rates of boob-related side effects. Brevinor users reported 71% enlarged breasts, and 71% tender breasts, compared to 43% enlarged breasts and 50% tender breasts by those on Microgynon.\nOnly 26% of people taking Brevinor experienced lighter periods, compared to 56% of people taking Microgynon.\n\nFemodette vs Millinette\nBrandOestrogenOestrogen levelProgestogenAndrocentricityFemodetteEthinylestradiolLow oestrogenGestodeneLess androgenicMillinette 20/75EthinylestradiolLow oestrogenGestodeneLess androgenicMillinette 30/75EthinylestradiolMedium oestrogenGestodeneLess androgenic\n76% of Lowdown reviewers who have used Millinette 30/75 have reported experiencing increased vaginal discharge, compared to 66% of those on Millinette 20/75 and 39% of Femodette users – so this could potentially be a good option for those who tend to experience vaginal dryness!\nIn addition to this, 40% of people using Millinette 20/75 experienced no change in their sex drive, whereas 57% of Lowdown reviewers using Femodette have said they lost theirs.\n\nWhat else Lowdown reviewers say?\nBelow is a snapshot of how Lowdown reviewers have found their experiences with some more of the most popular combined pill brands*, compared with their hormonal properties and which pill group they belong to. You can check out more information or individual reviews on each of the contraception pages for Gedarel 20/150, Gedarel 30/150, Microgynon, Millinette 20/75, Millinette 30/75 and Rigevidon.\n\n*These insights are accurate as of 7/11/22\nWant to see the differences between even more brands of pill? You can compare any two brands side-by-side using our contraception comparison tool!\nThe Lowdown’s progestogen-only pill groups\nThe progestogen-only pill is a little bit simpler than the combined pill. Here we’ve grouped the progestogen-only pills according to the type of progestogen it contains. \nGroupProgestogen typeProgestogen androgenicityBrand names1DesogestrelLess androgenicCerazette, Cerelle, Zelleta, Desogestrel, Aizea, Desomono, Desorex, Feonolla, Hana, Lovima2NorethisteroneAndrogenicMicronor, Noriday3LevonorgestrelAndrogenicNorgeston4DrospirenoneAnti-androgenicSlynd\nThere’s a key difference between these groups…\nGroup 1 mini pills\nGroup 1 pills contain desogestrel. Desogestrel progestogen-only pills must be taken within 12 hours of the same time every day.\nGroup 1 pills include mini pills Hana, Cerazette, Cerelle, Zelleta, Desogestrel, Aizea, Desomono, Desorex, Feonolla and Lovima.\nGroup 2 and 3 mini pills\nGroup 2 and 3 pills are known as ‘traditional’ progestogen-only pills. They contain either norethisterone or levonorgestrel and must be taken within 3 hours of the same time every day. If taken outside of this time window this counts as a ‘missed pill’. \nGroup 4 mini pills\nThere is soon to be a new type of progestogen-only pill available in the UK called Slynd! This POP contains 4mg of drospirenone, another type of synthetic progestogen, and is taken as 24 daily active pills followed by four hormone-free placebo pills (then repeat).\nIn contrast to the desogestrel and traditional POPs, the drospirenone POP is considered missed if you’re more than 24 hours late taking it. This means more than 48 hours after the last pill was taken or more than 24 hours after a new packet should have been started after 4 days of sugar pills (the hormone free interval).\nUnscheduled and irregular bleeding is a common side effect of all types of mini pill. If you switch between groups of progestogen only pills you may experience different bleeding patterns. Whilst we’re not sure why this is, it is useful to know you could try switching to another group if the bleeding you’re experiencing on one type of pill is problematic.\nIn summary… \nWhilst this may make contraception confusing for many, it is actually an advantage – having so many brands allows you to try alternatives if you don’t get on with one. It is possible to switch brands, depending on the types and concentrations of the hormones they contain, and ultimately find what’s best for you!

        "Title": "Contraception: Weight Gain and Loss",
        "Content": "\n✅ If you think you’ll find this blog helpful, make sure to check out our newsletter:\n\nThe debate surrounding contraception and weight gain is as old as the pill itself, but many of us rely on anecdotal evidence from friends and online forums to determine the side effects we might experience. It’s a complex issue, and one that has been researched extensively, so let’s see what the science says.\nDoes the combined pill make you gain weight?\nCombined methods of contraception, such as the combined pill, patch and ring, are those which deliver both oestrogen and progestogen to the body in order to stop the release of an egg each month and therefore prevent pregnancy. Studies have hypothesised that oestrogen may promote fat storage.¹ However, after much debate and many studies, there is no proof that combined birth control causes weight gain. In fact a review of available research in 2014 found no causal link between combined hormonal contraception and weight gain.² ³ ⁴ So why might you notice your weight change whilst using this method? \nWater retention\nOne reason some women might see an increase in their weight when taking combined contraception is water retention. Oestrogen affects the way our kidneys produce certain proteins, which can have an impact on the way the body regulates water, causing an increase in the fluid kept within the body’s tissues. This kind of water retention can also happen just before your period, and is responsible for that lovely puffy, bleugh feeling some of us are so familiar with. If you are affected by water retention on the combined pill it may be worth talking to your doctor about switching the brand or type of pill. Newer progestogens in some combined pills can help reduce these symptoms, and may be less likely to cause water retention than others. \nAppetite changes\nSome women find that hormonal birth control increases their appetite, causing them to eat more and experience weight gain. There’s a pretty big gap in the research about this, which is frustrating, so we can’t give you any definitive answers about whether there’s a proven link. This has been reported as something The Lowdown’s users have experienced, though, with some saying that appetite reduced when they stopped taking contraception. It’s important to note that some users also said they felt a decrease in appetite, so this is definitely something that needs further research. \nWeight restrictions\nCombined contraception is also the only form of contraceptive that is technically restricted depending on body mass index (BMI). BMI is a person’s weight in kilograms (or pounds) divided by the square of their height in meters (or feet). The Faculty of Reproductive and Sexual Healthcare in the UK state that if a woman’s BMI is over 35, the risks of using combined contraception outweigh the benefits.⁴ This is because the risk of a blood clot in the legs or the lungs rises as BMI increases and combined contraception increases this risk further.⁴  \nWhat are you saying?\n\n\nAt the time of writing, the majority of The Lowdown’s users reported no changes in weight when using the combined pill, with 31% saying they had gained weight and 4% reporting that they had lost weight.\nFor the patch, 52% of users reported no change, 24% reported weight gain and just 5% said that they had lost weight.\nThe vaginal ring seems to have the highest percentage of users reporting more stability in their weight, with 65% of users reporting no change, 12% reporting weight gain and 12% reporting weight loss. \nDoes the mini pill make you gain weight?\nProgestogen-only contraception, such as the mini pill, delivers progestogen to the body to prevent pregnancy. Research has found limited evidence of change in weight whilst using progestogen-only contraceptives.⁵ In studies most women gained less than 4.4lb (2kg) within 6 to 12 months of beginning progestogen-only contraception,⁵ so any weight gain you might experience from birth control is unlikely to be dramatic. There is no proof that the progestogen-only pill causes weight gain,³ but here we discuss why your weight might change whilst using this method.\nWater retention\nSynthetic progestogen (the stuff that’s made in a lab) has also been linked with water retention. As we said earlier, though, this isn’t fat, and progestogen-only contraceptive methods are less likely to cause these effects than those containing oestrogen.\nAppetite and weight changes\nAs with combined contraceptive methods, research surrounding appetite changes with the progestogen-only pill is limited. \nWhile some of The Lowdown’s users have reported weight gain on birth control, this varies in severity from a little to a lot of weight. Some users have stated that their appetite increased when they stopped taking progestogen-only contraception, and others found a decrease in their appetite while taking the mini pill. \nWhat are you saying?\n\nThe Lowdown’s users were pretty evenly split on this one: at the time of writing 42% of those using the progestogen-only pill reported no change in their weight, with 38% saying they’d gained weight and 4% saying they’d seen weight reduction.\n60% of hormonal coil users reported no change in their weight, with 18% reporting weight gain and 5% reporting weight loss.\nUsers of the implant reported a similar experience to those on the mini pill, with 37% reporting no change in their weight, 41% reporting an increase and 3% noticing weight loss.\nWhat about the hormonal coil?\nResearch suggests that whilst some people may experience weight gain whilst using the hormonal coil, this is not significant and no causal link has been identified. ³ ⁶ Whilst our Lowdown reviews suggest users of the implant experience similar changes in weight to those using the mini pill, users of the hormonal coil (aka IUS or hormonal IUD) are much more likely to report NO change in weight. This could be because the hormonal coil releases a lower daily dose of progestogen than other hormonal methods like contraceptive pills, or because users of the hormonal have less systemic absorption of progestogen (meaning lower levels of progestogen in the blood), which could be the reason for fewer associated side effects. More research is needed to determine whether this is the case.\nDoes the injection make you gain weight?\nLike the contraceptives above, the injection is a progestogen-only form of hormonal contraception. We’ve decided to give it its own section here, because the research, advice and side effects are slightly different to those of other progestogen-only methods.\nThe injection is the only method of contraception where weight gain is a proven potential side effect that women should be counselled for.³ ⁷ This sounds alarming, but in reality most women don’t gain weight when using the injection. However, the possible risk of weight gain is something that healthcare professionals should make women aware of when they are choosing their contraception, and the consequences of this side effect should be discussed before the injection is chosen. \nWho is most at risk?\nThe research as it stands doesn’t give us a precise answer about individual risk, but it does tell us a couple of things that might help you to make the best choice. Firstly, you are most likely to gain weight if you are under 18 with a BMI of over 30 when you begin using the injection.³ ⁷ Secondly, if you gain more than 5% of your body weight within six months of starting the injection, you are more likely to continue gaining weight.³ ⁷ If this sounds like you, it might be worth considering a different method of contraception.\nRestrictions\nWhilst your weight alone does not stop you from being able to use the injection as contraception, if you also smoke or have medical problems like diabetes the FSRH advises the risks may outweigh the benefits.⁴ If you are already overweight, you might want to consider a different contraception before choosing the injection to avoid potential negative effects on your health. \nWhat are you saying?\n\nAt the time of writing 53% of those using the injection told The Lowdown that they had gained weight, the highest of all the contraceptives. 35% reported no change in weight, and 3% reported weight loss. \nIt’s important to note that at the time of writing the majority of those who reviewed the injection for The Lowdown were under 25 years old. An early study using a broader age range found that whilst the injection was associated with weight gain slightly more frequently than other hormonal contraceptive methods, this wasn’t significant.⁸\nDoes hormone-free contraception make you gain weight?\nHormone-free contraception is defined as anything that prevents pregnancy but doesn’t contain any hormones. Here, we’ll discuss the copper coil, female sterilisation and condoms.\nCopper coil and weight gain\nThe copper coil (IUD) contains no hormones, so there is no biological reason it would cause weight changes. Research shows whilst women may experience weight changes whilst using the copper coil, this is not significant and there is no causal link.³ ⁶ Weight gain whilst using the copper coil is likely to be a consequence of confounding factors such as increasing age.\nBarrier methods\nBarrier methods, such as condoms and diaphragms, are not associated with weight changes. \nIrreversible methods\nWe’ll leave the boys out of this one and focus on female sterilisation. You might have heard of people ‘having their tubes tied’, which conjures up all sorts of baffling images, but in reality female sterilisation is a lot more simple than that. It’s a permanent and irreversible contraceptive procedure, involving an operation in which the fallopian tubes are blocked or removed (known as tubal ligation). \nAs tubal ligation does not affect your hormones or – as a result – appetite, it is not known to cause weight changes.\nWhat are you saying?\n\nAt the time of writing 76% of copper coil users told us that they saw no change in their weight, with 9% reporting weight gain and 5% reporting weight loss.\nFor people whose partners used the male condom, 98% saw no change in their weight, with 2% reporting that they couldn’t tell whether their weight had changed. For the female condom and the cap or diaphragm, 100% saw no change in their weight.\nOf those who had undergone tubal ligation (female sterilisation) 75% reported no change in weight, with 25% reporting a weight increase.\nAll men who had undergone vasectomies reported no change in their weight. \nDo natural methods make you gain weight?\nNatural contraceptive methods also contain no hormones, and rely on knowing your body and careful timing. \nFertility awareness \nNatural family planning, also known as the Fertility Awareness Method, involves monitoring your menstrual cycle to identify when you are most fertile. People who use this method will check for signs of ovulation, such as temperature and cervical mucus, and will avoid sex or use withdrawal or barrier methods (such as condoms) during this time. Apps like Natural Cycles can be used to log your cycle and identify your fertile days.\nAs natural family planning involves no changes to your hormones and doesn’t require any other internal or external influences on your body, it is not associated with causing weight changes.\nWhat are you saying?\nFor The Lowdown, 81% of those reviewing the Natural Cycles app reported no change in weight, with 8% saying that they had gained weight and 4% reporting that they had lost weight.  \nHow can natural contraception impact my weight?\nYou might be surprised by these numbers; if a method involves no hormones or other intervention, how can it impact your weight? More research is needed here, but we know women naturally gain weight as we get older, and weight changes are common during a normal menstrual cycle. Women using natural family planning may also be more likely to monitor their weight and be aware of fluctuations. \nHow can I tell whether my contraception is causing weight changes?\nWhile more research is needed into the effects of contraception on our appetite and weight in general, one thing is clear: we gain weight naturally with age. Research has shown⁸ changes in the fat tissue in our bodies as we age make it easier to gain weight, even if we don’t eat more or exercise less than before. In fact, the average person gains around one pound each year from adulthood.⁹ If you’ve been using a form of contraception for a while and have recently noticed an increase in your weight, it could be unrelated, but it is important to talk to your doctor if you are concerned.\nIt might also be worth thinking about any recent changes you might have had to your lifestyle; have you just moved in with your partner and are eating bigger portions? Have you started university and increased your alcohol intake? Has the pandemic forced you to be less active? There are many factors that can contribute towards weight gain, so it might be useful to look at the bigger picture before writing off your contraception. If you haven’t noticed any changes to your routine, or you simply aren’t sure, do go and speak to your healthcare provider for advice.\n\nThis blog can help you learn more about various contraception options, but it does not give medical advice. You should always speak to a nurse or doctor when making choices about contraception and before starting a new method.\nOne of The Lowdown’s fab Clinical Directors, Dr Melanie Davis-Hall BMBS (Hons) BMedSci (Hons) DFSRH MRCGP is a GP and a clinical editor for the British Medical Journal.

        "Content": "\nFirst things first, no body is the same and so everyone will get ‘back to normal’ in their own way after coming off birth control. It will be a slower process for some.Here we talk about coming off the combined pill and the potential side effects you might face when you stop taking it.\nHow long after stopping taking the pill will I get a period?\nThe first period you experience after coming off the pill is known as the “withdrawal bleed”. This is not the same as your normal period and normally lasts up to about seven days. Usually your second bleed will be your normal period. It can take a while for your period to go back to normal – or what is normal for you. The majority of people who leave reviews at The Lowdown find their usual menstrual cycle returns 1 to 3 months after stopping the combined pill. The NHS advises waiting three months for your menstrual cycle to normalise again.As one of the benefits of the combined pill is often lighter, less painful periods, you may notice your periods might be more painful and heavier after stopping the pill, but this may subside after a few months.\nSide effects and symptoms of coming off the pill\nHow will I feel after coming off the birth control pill?\nHormonal contraception can impact on your mood, so logically coming off the birth control may change how you feel. Some people start the pill to help with their mood. The combined pill can help with PMS (pre-menstrual syndrome) and PMDD (pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder) and so coming off the pill may lead to a worsening of these symptoms. On the other hand, others have reported a negative impact on their mood when using the combined pill that has improved when stopping.\nWill coming off birth control affect my skin?\nOne of the common reasons women like using the combined pill is the beneficial effect it has in improving your skin. In fact, it is often used by doctors as a treatment for acne. Some people find on stopping their combined pill that their acne or spots return or worsen initially, as their skin is no longer benefitting from the oestrogen effects of the combined pill. Read more about the impact of birth control on acne here. \nI’m coming off the pill to get pregnant, is my fertility affected?\nWhen you stop using the pill your fertility will return to whatever is normal for you. There is no significant difference in pregnancy rates when compared to those stopping other contraceptive methods or using no contraception. It is important to remember it is possible to get pregnant as soon as you stop taking the combined pill. If getting pregnant isn’t your goal, then you might want to consider switching to another form of contraception before you stop taking your birth control pill.Your fertility will still depend on your age, genetics and any underlying medical problems. Women who have used contraception for most of their reproductive lives may not be aware of problems affecting their fertility, as contraceptive effects may mask symptoms such as irregular periods. For some, it is only on stopping contraception, or trying to get pregnant, that they find out there may be an underlying issue. According to the NHS it is best to wait until after you’ve had your first natural period before trying for a baby. This gives you time to make sure you’re in the best physical health for carrying a baby. It also helps your GP or midwife predict your due date more accurately.\nOther contraceptive options\nIf you’re looking to come off the pill and switch to a different method of contraception then we have got you covered. There are many other different types to try, both hormonal and non-hormonal.If you fancy sticking with a hormonal contraceptive then you could try another pill. Trying a different brand or the progestogen only pill might suit your body better, but if you’re set on coming of the pill for good then your options include; other combined methods such as the contraceptive patch  or the vaginal ring, or progestogen only methods such as the hormonal coil, the injection or the implant.You can order the Evra contraceptive patch and the Sayana Press injection from the Lowdown.There are non-hormonal options available too. You could try the copper coil, condoms, the female condom, or fertility awareness based methods.It’s a good idea to talk to a healthcare professional if you plan to stop taking your birth control pill. They can help you decide which method you want to switch to and help you plan how best to do this. \nWhat do our reviewers say?\nNo two individuals will have the exact same experience, but at The Lowdown we try to be as informative as possible. We’ve picked out a few examples from our reviews below, and recommend looking through the rest of our reviews if you want to see more! \nSophie is a Cardiff University- trained journalist who is passionate about sharing womens’ contraception stories in the hope that it will connect with others.You can find her on Twitter.\n",

        "Title": "The pill and boobs",
        "Content": "\n\nOur boobs are weird, wonderful, ever-changing things. They can grow and shrink, change in texture and require near-constant support (why are bras so expensive? Has anyone figured that out yet?)\nOne of the most common side effects The Lowdown users report for all contraception methods are tender breasts and enlarged breasts. There are lots of boob-y changes that can occur throughout our monthly cycle, and as our breasts are accessories to our reproductive system, it makes sense that they’d be affected by our hormones. Whether that’s naturally occurring hormones during the menstrual cycle or the artificial ones in hormonal contraception. \nHere, we’ll talk about common breast problems and what the evidence says about their relationship to hormonal contraception. We won’t be talking about breast cancer here – but we’ll cover practically everything else, from size changes to cysts.\n\nBreast size changes\nSome people may experience an increase in the size of their boobs when they begin taking hormonal contraception. This is quite common, but usually not permanent. The hormones in your contraception can cause fluid retention, changes to breast tissue or possibly weight gain, all of which usually pass within a few months of starting to take the pill. \nIf you carry on taking the pill, or stop taking it altogether, your boobs should go back to their normal size. \nHow can you tell if you’re experiencing breast size changes?\nIf you’ve just started the pill and your bra feels tighter, or your boobs are sore or tender, you might be experiencing breast size changes. \nIf your breasts are larger because you’re experiencing water retention, you might notice that they return to normal during your pill-free week (if you have one). Keeping a diary for a couple of months may help with this.\n\nDoes the pill make your breasts bigger?\nOestrogen is known to cause fluid retention, while progestogen is thought to have the opposite effect. It stands to reason, then, that combined oral contraception (the pill that contains both oestrogen and progestogen) may be more likely to cause water retention than the progestogen-only pill. \nIf you experience unwanted changes in your breast size whilst using combined hormonal contraception, a pill with a lower dose of oestrogen or a different type of progestogen, or a progestogen-only method might be better options. Do remember, though, that water retention, weight gain and breast tenderness caused by the hormones in your birth control usually pass within a few months. \nAre changes in breast size associated with how you take your contraception?\nPeople who take combined hormonal contraception (i.e the combined pill, patch or ring) may have a hormone-free week (although this isn’t necessary, as you can use these methods continuously). During this hormone-free week, any water retention that might be causing your boobs to swell may lessen. \nLifestyle measures that can help with changes in breast size\nThere isn’t much that can be done about the temporary hormonal changes you might experience in the first few months of taking the pill. It’s always important to wear a bra that fits properly to reduce any discomfort you feel, and while it might seem wasteful to buy new underwear for something which will probably pass, it’s likely to be worth the investment.\nIf you’re experiencing water retention, there are a few things you can do. Keep well hydrated, cut back on salt and exercise frequently to reduce fluid build up. However if your breasts feel uncomfortable and this persists after a few months of starting contraception, speak to a healthcare professional about your options.\n\nFibroadenoma\nA fibroadenoma is a non-cancerous tumour found in the breast tissue. You can get fibroadenomas at any age, but they’re more common during your 20s and 30s. They’re usually totally harmless, and are generally pain-free, but might cause you discomfort or feel tender just before your period. A fibroadenoma will feel like a marble under the skin, and should be smooth to touch.\nWe don’t really know what causes fibroadenomas, but there is some research that suggests that taking oral contraceptives before the age of 20 could increase your risk of developing one. \nHow can you tell you’re experiencing fibroadenoma?\nA fibroadenoma will feel like a smooth lump just under the skin of your breast. It should move easily when you push it. Of course, it goes without saying that any lump in your breast should be checked out by your doctor – they’ll be able to confirm exactly what it is, and will be able to put your mind at rest. \nThe Breast Cancer Now charity website has a wealth of information about fibroadenoma.\nCan the pill cause fibroadenoma?\nFibroadenomas could be caused by a portion of your breast’s glandular tissue being oversensitive to oestrogen. So you’d have thought that contraceptive pills containing oestrogen would increase the risk or size of a fibroadenoma – but interestingly, there isn’t evidence to support this. \nThere is evidence, though, that combined oral contraceptives (those containing both oestrogen and progestogen) could reduce hospital referral rates for fibroadenoma. Some studies have found that oral contraceptive use in general can reduce incidences of fibroadenoma by 30-50%. This effect is mainly seen in women who are currently using oral contraceptives, and have been for a long time, or women who have recently stopped taking oral contraceptives after long-term use. \nSome oral contraceptives may protect against fibroadenoma by inhibiting ovulation and preventing changes in breast cells that take place in the first half of the menstrual cycle. \nIs fibroadenoma associated with how you take your contraception?\nThere doesn’t appear to be any evidence currently that taking the pill continuously or with a break has an impact on your risk of developing fibroadenoma. \nLifestyle measures that can help with fibroadenoma\nFibroadenomas sometimes go away on their own. If you are experiencing pain and discomfort because of a fibroadenoma which has been confirmed and diagnosed by a doctor, you can try paracetamol or ibuprofen gel, or taking starflower oil or evening primrose oil, which contain gamma linolenic acid (GLA) which has been shown to reduce breast pain. You can now buy starflower oil and other products to help with contraception side effects at The Lowdown! Or purchase from our Amazon affiliate link (checked by doctors!)\n\nBenign fibrocystic breast disease\nBenign fibrocystic breast disease is a condition whereby the breasts feel lumpy. It’s really common, and doesn’t pose any risk to your health. It’s estimated that more than half of all women will experience fibrocystic breast disease at some point in their lives, and there’s actually a recent push to stop calling it a disease at all. In fact, it’s totally normal for your breasts to fluctuate in texture throughout your menstrual cycle. \nHow can you tell you’re experiencing benign fibrocystic breast disease?\nYou may experience breast lumps that change throughout your menstrual cycle. For some women, these lumps may cause general pain in the breast, and green or dark brown discharge from the nipples. Some women may find that the lumps in their breasts, and any pain associated with them, increase during the time between ovulation and the start of their period.\nIf you feel a lump in your breast, or discharge from your nipples, never self-diagnose. Pay a visit to your doctor, who will be able to determine whether it is benign fibrocystic breast disease or not. \nIs benign fibrocystic breast disease associated with any particular contraceptives?\nSome research suggests that the use of oral contraceptives may actually reduce your risk of benign fibrocystic breast disease, and this protective effect is thought to be greater the longer you have been taking oral contraception. There is opposing evidence, however, that oral contraceptive use has no effect on the development of fibrocystic breast disease, either in long-term or recent users. This research also found that previous oral contraceptive use made post-menopausal women more likely to develop fibrocystic breast disease.\nIs benign fibrocystic breast disease associated with how you take your contraception?\nThere isn’t any concrete evidence that any specific oral contraception regimen has an effect on fibrocystic breast disease risk. However, some people find that their contraception helps to relieve breast pain they might have previously experienced just before their period, so the pill may help in tackling this aspect.\nLifestyle measures that can help with benign fibrocystic breast disease\nIf you’re experiencing pain or discomfort because of benign fibrocystic breast disease, the best starting point is to check that you’ve got a good, well-fitting bra. As with fibroadenoma, you can use over the counter painkillers, starflower oil or evening primrose oil, a heated pad or hot water bottle to relieve your symptoms.\n\nCyclical breast pain\nWhen your boobs are sore at certain times of the month, like just before your period, it’s referred to as cyclical breast pain. Some people experience severe pain, which can last for the full two weeks before their period. \nIt is believed that cyclical breast pain occurs in those who are more sensitive to the normal hormonal changes that occur before the start of their period.\nHow can you tell you’re experiencing cyclical breast pain?\nIf you find that your boobs are sore or uncomfortable in the days or weeks leading up to your period, and this is something that occurs monthly, you may have cyclical breast pain. Some find that their cyclical breast pain comes and goes; they may have a few months with it before it disappears, and it may then reappear months or years later.\nIs cyclical breast pain associated with any particular contraceptives?\nCyclical breast pain, by definition, is a result of the hormonal fluctuations in your natural menstrual cycle. Hormonal contraception disrupts or overrides this cycle, often preventing you from ovulating and from having a regular period. Breast pain that you feel while taking hormonal contraception, then, is not due to the hormones in your menstrual cycle. Hormonal contraception may sometimes be prescribed as a treatment for cyclical breast pain, as it disrupts the natural cycle and prevents the hormone fluctuations that cause the pain each month. \nHowever, breast pain can also be a side effect of hormonal contraception. Some find that the hormones in the combined pill make their boobs sore, while others find that the progestogen in the mini pill causes discomfort or tenderness. Annoyingly, there’s no real way to tell whether one or the other is likely to give you breast pain until you’ve tried it. Read more about why your boobs may be sore.\nIs cyclical breast pain associated with how you take your contraception?\nCyclical breast pain is related to your menstrual cycle. You may experience cyclical breast pain whilst using contraception if you are still having menstrual cycles, such as with non-hormonal methods like the copper coil (IUD) or fertility awareness methods (FAM), and also with some progestogen-only methods like the hormonal coil or some mini pills which do not stop you ovulating.  \nThere is no evidence to suggest that taking combined oral contraception continually or with a break is more likely to cause breast pain, although some individuals may notice differences. \nLifestyle measures that can help with cyclical breast pain\nBreast pain, whether cyclical or as a result of your contraception, can be frustrating. Keeping a diary for a couple of months may help you work out if you are experiencing cyclical breast pain by looking at the pattern in relation to your menstrual cycle. You might find that a hot water bottle, cold compress, painkillers like paracetamol and ibuprofen, or starflower oil or evening primrose oil help to alleviate your symptoms.\n\nBreast cysts\nA breast cyst is a sac of fluid that develops in the glands in the breasts. Breast cysts can be large enough to feel, and are usually smooth and move easily under the skin. Breast cysts are usually not cancerous, and do not require treatment unless they are causing particular discomfort.\nHow can you tell you’re experiencing breast cysts?\nIf you have a lump in your breast that feels as though it’s full of water, like a grape or a small balloon, it may be a breast cyst. Breast cysts can also be hard. It’s really important to get any new lump checked out with your doctor to rule out other conditions. If you have one or more breast cysts, they may become bigger or more painful just before your period. You might also experience brown, yellow or clear nipple discharge.\nAre breast cysts associated with any particular contraceptives?\nThere is no evidence that hormonal contraception increases your risk of breast cysts. \nLifestyle measures that can help with breast cysts\nIf you have a breast cyst that’s causing you pain or discomfort a hot water bottle or cold compress, or over-the-counter painkillers like paracetamol, might reduce the severity of the pain. You can also try starflower oil or evening primrose oil to alleviate your symptoms. If you have a breast cyst that is causing you particular discomfort, your doctor may recommend that you have it drained.\n\n\nMary Hargreaves is a writer and author with a passion for women’s reproductive health.

        "Title": "Can your contraceptive affect your mood?",
        "Content": "\n✅ If you think you’ll find this blog interesting, then check out our newsletter for more:\nSince the birth of the pill, some users have noticed a significant change in their mental health. For some of us, hormonal contraception seems to make the fluctuations in our mood more noticeable meaning people consider stopping or changing contraception because of negative mood side effects.\nOf all the potential threats posed to our mood, depression is perhaps the most worrying. Some research shows that hormonal contraception is associated with the risk of attempted suicide ¹, and while findings like these are definitely alarming, they don’t paint a complete picture. What they do do, is highlight how important it is that we understand how our contraception choices can affect our mental health. \nIs there a proven link between hormonal contraception and low mood?\nYes – but it isn’t quite as simple as that. A quick Google search of this question is a bit baffling: for every piece of research showing that low mood side effects exist, there is another study claiming the opposite. The problem is that contraceptive users have been reporting these possible side effects for years, but actual research into this topic has been patchy to say the least.\nA Danish study from 2016 reported that women are more likely to be started on antidepressants for the first time or to be diagnosed with depression for the first time if they are currently using or have recently used hormonal contraception.² However the study did not account for possible confounding factors (i.e. real life) and importantly does not establish a causal link between hormonal contraception and depression.\nThe Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Health in the UK have released two statements in recent years in response to studies that look at hormonal contraception and depression.³ ⁴ At present they advise healthcare professionals to tell patients that whilst it is recognised that some people report that they experience mood changes associated with hormonal contraception, there is no clear evidence that hormonal contraception causes or worsens depression.³\nHow might hormonal contraception influence mood?\nAll forms of hormonal contraception are associated with possible mood changes. The Summaries of Product Characteristics (and the info you get in your pill packet) for hormonal contraceptives list mood disorders as a potential side effect. Hormonal contraception contains oestrogen and/or progestin. These are synthetic versions of the hormones naturally produced by the female body. Progestins bind to progesterone receptors in the body causing changes that prevent pregnancy but which also seems to contribute to mood changes for some people.  What doesn’t often get talked about is how hormonal contraception can also change lives for the better! In particular combined contraception can benefit people who have heavy, painful periods, irregular bleeding, acne or premenstrual syndrome (PMS). These are all conditions which can have a detrimental effect on mental health, so it goes without saying that treating these could greatly improve your mood!This goes some way to explaining why it’s difficult to draw conclusions from even large studies. We also don’t have standardised ways to objectively measure mood in research and as you can imagine, there’s no way to isolate study participants from the real world and the relationships, jobs and life stressors we experience.\nAre there specific brands that impact mood?\nHere’s the particularly bamboozling part: different combined contraceptives (those with both oestrogen and progestin) have different doses of each hormone and in particular different types of progestogen. Add to this that oestrogen and progestin can interact with each other in different ways, and we have ourselves a research minefield. Essentially, we have pills, patches, coils and injections, all with their own unique recipes and therefore potential side-effects. Most research tends to lump these together in the same studies, meaning it’s difficult to find any specific conclusions.While research conclusions vary and more is definitely needed, here’s what some of the evidence could suggest:\n\nCombined pills containing the progestogen drospirenone could have a more beneficial effect on mood than pills containing other progestogens ⁵\nContinuous use of combined methods where you take the pill, patch or vaginal ring back to back without a break and skipping the associated withdrawal bleed may be of benefit to mood ⁵\n\n\nProgestogen only contraceptive methods may be linked to higher rates of low mood ²\nNon-oral forms of hormonal contraception may be linked with a higher risk of depression (like the hormonal coil, patch and ring) ²\nEmerging research suggests newer pills containing oestrogen more similar to that naturally produced by the body may have a better mood side effect profile. ⁶\n\nBut if speaking to our friends about hormonal contraception has taught us anything, it’s that how it affects one person can be very different to how it affects another. In fact, who you are might actually be the most pressing thing to consider.\nFrom clinical experience doctors say those who find their mood adversely affected by a specific hormonal contraceptive preparation will not necessarily have the same problem with other hormonal contraceptives.\nHow can I weigh up my individual risk?\nThere are several factors that research suggests that may mean you are more susceptible to the negative mental health effects of hormonal contraception:\n\nYour age. A study showed teenagers were more likely to suffer from low mood and depression when using hormonal contraception. ⁵ It may be that, the older you are, the less likely it is that you’ll experience these effects. However the study did not factor in possible other influences on teenagers’ mental health. \nYour medical history. If you have a history of mood disorder or depression, you might be more susceptible to experiencing low moods when using hormonal contraception.\nYour contraceptive history. If you experienced a negative impact on your mood the first time you tried the combined pill, you may be more likely to experience these side effects again.\nJust… you. Some people are simply more sensitive to changes in their oestrogen and progesterone levels. We know, we know – this information isn’t exactly stamped on your birth certificate. Only trial and error will tell you if you fall into this category.\n\nOur contraception quiz takes into account all of these factors to determine the best form of contraception for you – try it today!\nWhat does The Lowdown’s review data say?\nAs part of our contraception review form, we ask you how your contraception has affected your mood. The table below reflects data taken from reviews at the time of writing, and some methods with less than 100 reviews have been labelled. For more information on each method and specific brands, check out our contraception pages. This table shows how many Lowdown reviewers have found contraception to have either a negative, no change or positive effect on their mood.\nIt might be surprising to see the combined pill top the charts here and it is interesting to see the hormonal coil may have a lower impact than its oral counterparts. As you can see, even reviewers who have the copper coil, a non-hormonal contraceptive, have also reported negative effects on their mood. This could be down to the fact that the copper coil can commonly cause heavier periods, which may have an indirect effect on mood.These ‘sad face’ percentages reflect reviewers who have marked their contraception as having a ‘somewhat’ and ‘very’ negative affect on their mood – so this could include low mood, mood swings, anxiety and irritability, for example. Check out the reviews for each method for more detailed experiences.\nDoes the progestogen-only pill cause mood swings and depression?\nIt’s important to reiterate that everyone is different, and while one pill may work for someone else, it may not for you. A lot of mini pill users also find that mood related side effects are temporary – lasting for a few weeks or months (not that you should have to put up with them at all!). The Lowdown has over 1,000 reviews for the progestogen-only pill, and the below table shows how many Lowdown reviewers have found the four most popular brands of mini pill to have either a negative, no change or positive effect on their mood.Here’s a snapshot of what our reviews says about the Desogestrel progestogen-only pill and mood changes…\n\nWhat information should I look for when choosing hormonal contraception?\n\nWhat we should really be looking out for is robust studies to clarify any association between hormonal contraception and depression. Research into the effects of different types and levels of progestins and oestrogen, the interaction between these two and how they affect different individuals would be helpful. You can use The Lowdown’s contraception comparison service to compare every single type of contraception, to help you decide which contraception will be best for you. Or have a browse through the contraception reviews, on our website, from people like you for further guidance.\nAnnoying as it might seem, the take-home message is one that you have probably heard a million times before: try it and see. As the research stands at the minute, the most important factors to consider are your age, medical background and contraceptive history; something which didn’t suit your friend might be a good fit for you, and vice versa.\nIt is important to remember that not every woman experiences low mood when using hormonal contraception. Some women find no change to their emotional state, and others notice an improvement as some methods of contraception can improve heavy, painful periods, PMS, acne and other bothersome symptoms.\nIf you’re frustrated, remember that the perfect pill may not exist for every woman, but there are lots of other options out there! Chat to your healthcare professional or one of our fabulous medical team about your contraception to find the balance that works for you. \nThis blog can help you learn more about various contraception options, but it does not give medical advice. You should always speak to a nurse or doctor when making choices about contraception and before starting a new method. One of The Lowdown’s fab Clinical Directors, Dr Frances Yarlett MBBCh (Hons) BSc (Hons) MRCP (2016) MRCGP DFSRH completed her medical training from Cardiff University in 2013. She is currently working as a salaried GP partner in Sheffield with an interest in complex medical patients and women’s health. Fran is really passionate about patient choice and wants to empower women to take control of their bodies and contraception needs.\n",

        "Content": "\n✅ If you think you’ll enjoy this blog, check out our newsletter for more!\n\nWhat is a urinary tract infection?\nAh, the urinary tract infection (UTI) sixth sense. Many of us can feel a UTI¹ coming from a mile away – the dreaded lower back pain, the urgency to pee more than usual – it’s enough to send you fleeing to the supermarket and chugging down litre upon litre of cranberry juice in a desperate attempt to stave off the inevitable. They’re uncomfortable and inconvenient and can affect the best of us – in fact 50% of women will suffer from a UTI at some point in their life, with many going on to suffer from recurrent UTIs which can severely impact quality of life.\nThe majority of UTIs are caused by Escherichia coli – a bacteria that resides in the intestine as part of normal, healthy gut flora. This bug can become problematic when it finds its way to the urinary tract and subsequently causes an infection in the bladder, urethra, or the kidneys.\nUTIs are a colossal inconvenience and not nearly spoken about widely enough, and although they can affect men, women are more susceptible due to having a shorter urethra (the tube you pee from) which means bacteria have a shorter distance to travel to reach the bladder or kidneys and subsequently cause infection. Common UTI symptoms can include:\n\nPain, or a burning sensation when you pee\nPain in your lower back or tummy\nCloudy urine\nNeeding to pee more than usual\n\nHow are UTIs treated?\nAntibiotics are currently the go-to treatment for recurrent UTIs and in the UK at the moment you are likely to be given one of trimethoprim, nitrofurantoin, amoxicillin or cefalexin. Of course, these don’t come without their possible side effects – nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headaches, to name a few. Not to mention that pesky little looming global crisis called antibiotic resistance which could mean that, over time, a UTI may no longer respond to antibiotic treatment.\nA while ago, we did a Sunday Surgery session on our Instagram where loads of our community raved about taking D-mannose as a preventative measure for UTIs, so we decided to do a little digging.\n\nWhat is D-mannose and how does it work?\nD-mannose is a naturally-occurring, simple sugar, closely related to glucose. It’s found in small amounts in food like: oranges, peaches, cranberries, apples, and coffee, and can now also be bought in many health shops as a food supplement.\nIt’s understood that D-mannose binds to bacteria within the urinary tract, thus preventing it from attaching to the cells of the bladder wall and subsequently hindering the establishment and progression of an infection. Unable to attach to the wall, bacteria are flushed out in urine and eliminated from the urinary tract.\n\nWhen should I take D-mannose? And how often?\nPeople have found most success in taking D-mannose as a preventative measure, rather than as treatment for an active UTI. However a 2016 pilot study³ included women who had acute cystitis and/or a history of recurrent UTIs and concluded that taking D-mannose may be effective in both treatment and prevention of cystitis.\nAs D-mannose is considered a supplement, and not medication, there isn’t much indication on the exact recommended dosage of D-mannose. One clinical trial⁴ administered 2g of D-mannose powder dissolved in 200 mL water daily to study participants.\nFor now, we’d suggest carefully reading and following the instructions indicated on the packaging and talking to your doctor or pharmacist beforehand.\n\nCan I take D-mannose with antibiotics?\nWhilst research in this area is relatively scarce, a 2020 study⁵ indicated that high D-mannose concentrations do not interfere with the activity of different antibiotics (gentamicin, ampicillin, azithromycin, linezolid, tetracyclines, and ciprofloxacin).\nIf you have been diagnosed with an acute UTI, you may be prescribed antibiotics by your healthcare professional to treat this. D-Mannose can be used alongside prescription antibiotics.\nIf you have recurrent UTIs and use D-Mannose as a preventative treatment, you may avoid getting a full-blown UTI altogether; avoiding the need for antibiotics.\n\nDoes D-mannose really work?\nUnfortunately, studies on D-mannose and UTIs have been somewhat few and far between. A randomised controlled trial in 2013 concluded that D-mannose powder reduced the risk of recurrent UTI and produced similar results to those treated with the antibiotic nitrofurantoin.⁹\nMore promisingly, a very recent University of Oxford clinical trial⁶ aimed to look at the impact of D-mannose on recurrent UTIs in 508 women across a period of six months. The study ended in June 2021 and we’re still (eagerly) awaiting the results.\nWe’ve had countless testimonials from the Lowdown community singing D-mannose’s praises when it comes to preventing UTIs, especially after sex. Which is why we decided to create our own D-mannose capsules, using feedback from our community, while we wait for the results of the clinical trial.\n\nDoes D-mannose cause side effects?\nAgain, there’s rather limited information on side effects due to the lack of studies. The most common side effect that users have mentioned is diarrhoea. One clinical trial⁷ noted fewer side effects with D-mannose compared to antibiotics.\nWho should not use D-mannose?\nPregnant women should avoid taking D-mannose, as advised by the NHS. If you have symptoms of a UTI during pregnancy, speak to your healthcare provider about treatment as soon as possible to avoid complications.\nD-mannose is metabolised differently to glucose, so is not considered problematic to those who have diabetes. However, it’s probably worth discussing this with your doctor beforehand. Also be mindful that many of the powder supplements found in health shops contain a high concentration of other sweeteners.\nSo, should I use D-mannose?\nTo sum up, there’s still a lot of research to be done when it comes to D-mannose and whether it can reduce the incidence of UTIs, but we’re very hopeful about the most recent clinical trial. What we do know is that many of our community swear by D-mannose to stave off UTIs before an infection forms – and our whole thing is listening to personal experiences when it comes to women’s health.\nThe good news is that if you did want to try D-mannose to prevent UTIs, compared to the standard antibiotics, D-mannose has comparatively fewer side effects and doesn’t add to the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria associated with UTIs.\n\nLi Sa is a medical writer and previously trained as a microbiology clinical scientist with the NHS.

        "Title": "Coping with heavy periods at work",
        "Content": "\n✅ If you think you’ll find this blog helpful, check out our newsletter for more:\n\nThe bleary eyed morning commute is bad already without the arrival of that all too familiar ‘gushing’ feeling and the knowledge that you’re going to have to get through work on your period. Peeling yourself out of your cosy bed and into the slate grey dystopia of the office (or any workplace for that matter!) can be especially uncomfortable if you experience heavy bleeding. \nBTW, the signs of heavy periods (which are very common) include:\n\nChanging your pad or tampon every 1 to 2 hours, or needing to empty your menstrual cup more often than is recommended\nNeeding to ‘double up’ on protection i.e. using a pad and a tampon \nHaving periods that last beyond 7 days\nPassing blood clots that are larger than a 10p coin\nBleeding onto clothes or bedding\nAvoiding daily activities such as exercise because of your periods\nFeeling tired or short of breath\n\nSuffering from heavy periods? You’re not alone \nUnpleasant, yes, but uncommon – absolutely not. There can be varied statistics but around 9-14 out of every 100 people who menstruate experience heavy periods. If the symptoms are not affecting your quality of life and you are not suffering from anaemia (low haemoglobin/red blood cells), which can be caused by heavy bleeding) it may be that you choose not to take any action or to seek treatment.\nA survey of 2000 cisgender women conducted by Bupa showed that 23% of respondents had taken time off work because of their period within the last 6 months, with a further 36% not feeling comfortable to tell their employer the reason for their absence from work. From the fear of a ruby red stain on the back of your work clothes, to having to explain your symptoms to colleagues who ‘just don’t get it’, it is understandable that heavy periods at work can be super uncomfortable and stressful. In this blog we are going to provide some advice and solutions that can help to make working with heavy periods less of a burden. \n\nTips for dealing with heavy periods at work\nThere are a few ways to make heavy periods at work more bearable. Some of these are related to behavioural changes and others are medical treatments.\nPlanning in advance\nSo, one of the best ways to make a heavy period at work feel more comfortable is by advance preparation.\nMake sure you’re fully stocked up on tampons and sanitary towels\nKeep a stash of period products in your locker or desk drawer at work, so you never need to worry that you’re going to run out mid-way through the weekly budgeting meeting!\nPeriod first aid kits\nSo, you’re all covered for tampons and pads, but there are many bits and pieces that can make for a more comfortable set-up during your 9-5. Stock up on painkillers, heat patches (a particular favourite of mine) and chocolate. Don’t forget your Myoovi too, which is designed to stop your period cramps instantly. For a double whammy of pain relief and reducing flow, stick some Ibuprofen in your kit. These anti-inflammatory painkillers can reduce blood loss by 25-30%. \nIncluding iron in your diet\nIf you have heavy periods it is quite common to feel tiredness and low energy due to a lack of iron. This is because of excessive blood loss. Ensuring that you eat plenty of foods that are rich in iron can be a good way to ensure that you feel full of energy and in your best state of health during your period. Foods that are rich in iron include dark, leafy vegetables, red meat and nuts. In fact, studies show that extra iron in the diet can reduce PMS symptoms by a whopping 30-40%!\nKeeping a period diary\nThis can be really handy in helping to identify any patterns, changes or anything that might prompt you to have a chat with your GP. If you begin to notice anything new, such as elongated periods or that they’re becoming progressively heavier, it is a good idea to seek some advice.\nAlso, by tracking your period in this way, you’ll know when the heavier days (hello, day 2) are about to sneak up on you once again, and can plan accordingly. This even extends to planning to only perform particular work tasks for that day – perhaps trying to keep the first couple of days as meeting free, or working from home when you’re bleeding more (if you can).\nPeriod tracking diaries are also useful for figuring out if there are times where your period becomes heavier or more irregular during times of stress.\nStain removal\nKeeping stain remover on hand can offer some reassurance. Home remedies like white vinegar, bicarbonate or soda and lemon juice are also said to be effective! Wearing darker or looser clothing for period bloat can limit the awful fear that you’re inadvertently walking round the office with a scarlet splodge on your skirt as well as providing more comfort.\n\nAre you using the right sanitary products for you?\nGone are the days where the only choice was between Tampax and Always. Since these more ‘traditional’ options, the world of period products has exploded with different alternatives to billowing maxi pads (which, if they work for you is great, keep doing what you’re doing). However, if you continue to find stains on your crisp white bed linen, perhaps switching up what you use (depending both on flow and what you feel like cycle-to-cycle) could make life much more comfortable. Think about it, given that we’ll each have around 450 menstrual cycles across our lives, from our teens to our 50s…it does indeed make sense that we’re not going to stick to one product forever. As our lives evolve, those options will too. \nThere are reports that menstrual cups can be a great option for heavy flows, as they can hold the equivalent of 3 super tampons and are able to be worn for up to 12 hours. The lesser known sibling of cups, menstrual discs, can also hold 3 super tampons worth of blood, with the ability to wear them for up to 6 hours. If you’re able to predict thereabouts when you’ll start your period, you can preemptively pop your menstrual cup or disc in before your flow starts too. So you’ll never encounter that heart-sinking moment where you can’t find one slightly crumpled, ancient tampon in the bottom of your handbag when you realise you’ve come on unexpectedly!\nA comfortable combination could also be to invest in a pair of period pants. There are lots of sleek options, even period thongs, which can provide additional peace of mind and can feel smoother on your skin than a pad. Options from Modibodi can hold up to 3-4 tampons worth of blood in the lining, plus they are washable and therefore a sustainable investment. WUKA are another great option.\nAsk work to accommodate your needs\nIt is not okay to feel like you have to struggle through the heaviest days of your period at work. Not only will it make it impossible to concentrate, but this can affect your wellbeing..\nIf your period is making work difficult for you, it’s a really good idea to have a chat with your manager. Explaining the impact that certain cycle days have on you within the month will help them to consider changes or explore how they can accommodate specific requirements for you. As mentioned above, it may be that you are able to work from home on these days, or can schedule longer breaks between meetings.\nThe HR team is also on hand for support and advice. This might be a better option if you don’t feel comfortable to speak directly to your manager. It may be that your employer has particular policies in place that can make life easier, plus HR will also definitely be interested in suggestions you may have. One example could be to suggest to HR that they stock period products in the company toilets. Not only would this be extremely useful but it is part of a wider cultural change in the company – HR will be the ones responsible for implementing and championing any of these sorts of initiatives.\nTreatments available for heavy periods \nAside from over-the-counter treatments mentioned above such as Ibuprofen, there are other medications which can help to manage a heavy flow. \nTranexamic acid\nTranexamic acid affects blood clotting and reduces the tendency to bleed. Research tells us it is more effective than NSAIDs, and can really help to improve quality of life by reducing bleeding. People who have consistently heavy periods can take tranexamic acid on a long term basis, but usually you’d take two tablets three times a day for 5 days when your periods are heaviest (it can take around 24 hours to work).\nTranexamic acid doesn’t contain any hormones and won’t affect your cycle, so it’s great for people who want to avoid synthetic hormones. It can be used at the same time as all other contraception, and is particularly useful for heavy periods on the copper coil (IUD).\nHormonal contraception\nHormonal contraception could also be a solution to coping with heavy periods at work. We all know that the menstrual cycle is a delicate balance, kept in check by hormones. So, it makes a lot of sense that medications and treatments that affect your hormones may help to reduce bleeding, with added contraceptive benefits.\nAll forms of hormonal contraception can be used to help periods, in particular, combined methods such as the pill, patch and ring can help regulate periods and lighten flow. Especially when used continuously or back to back. Progestogen-only methods such as the mini pill, injection and implant can also lessen flow and stop periods, and the hormonal coil (IUS) releases a low dose of progestogen; which has a great track record for stopping periods and reducing flow.\nSurgical options\nIf there’s an underlying cause such as fibroids or polyps, removal of these would be effective in reducing blood loss. \nWhen to speak to a healthcare professional\nAs a rule of thumb, if your periods are so heavy that they are preventing you from carrying out your daily activities, this should be explored with your healthcare provider. It might be that there is no underlying health issue, but it is definitely worth having a chat to rule out health conditions such as endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). If you experience any changes to your menstrual cycle, such as a sudden increase in flow, it is also recommended that you seek medical advice.\nIf you’re having trouble coping with heavy periods at work, and would like quick and friendly medical advice, book an appointment with one of The Lowdown’s GPs to discuss management options, and potential contraception methods that could work for you. Or alternatively, you can use our contraception recommender to find the best contraception method for you. \n\n\n\n\nEmma is a Pharmacology & Physiology graduate with a huge passion for women’s health.

        "Content": "\nWhat is the vaginal ring?\nThe vaginal ring is a combined hormonal contraception method containing the hormones oestrogen and progestogen. It is inserted into the vagina for 21 days, after which you remove it (and throw it away) to have a 7 day ring-free break, during which you will have a withdrawal bleed.\nAlternatively, you can use the vaginal ring continuously to skip your withdrawal bleed, just like the combined pill, and replace your ring after 21 days with a new one.\n\nHow to insert the vaginal ring\nThe vaginal ring can be a bit fiddly to get used to, but if you’ve previously used a menstrual cup or diaphragm, you may be more used to getting in the right position to insert it correctly. Don’t worry, you’ll be a pro in no time after watching Dr Becky’s explainer video! We’ve also created a handy illustrated infographic on how to insert the vaginal ring.\n/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/vaginal_ring_how_to_becky.mp4\n\nWhat’s the difference between the SyreniRing and the NuvaRing?\nThe SyreniRing and NuvaRing are pretty much the same in every way, except for one key feature. They both contain the same types and amounts of oestrogen and progestogen and are inserted the same way and for the same length of time. The key difference is that the SyreniRing doesn’t need to be refrigerated, so you can be prescribed up to 12 months of the SyreniRing at once. If you use the NuvaRing, however, you will only be prescribed 3 months supply at a time, as it must be refrigerated before being dispensed, and then used within 4 months.\nThe Lowdown now offers a subscription service! Which means you don’t have to remember to reorder your vaginal ring, we’ll deliver it straight to your door before you run out. It’s easy to set up a contraception subscription with us in a few easy steps.\nRemember: it’s important to store your vaginal ring at room temperature, in a cool, dry place away from sunlight.\n\n",

        "Title": "Can stress cause heavy periods?",
        "Content": "\n✅ If you think you’ll find this blog interesting, make sure to check out our newsletter for more!\n\nLife can be really stressful. From the spiralling cost of living to the global climate emergency – we’re working harder than ever and under increasingly challenging circumstances. So it’s little wonder that in the past year, 74% of people in the UK have felt so stressed they have felt overwhelmed or unable to cope.\nStress can affect our bodies in many different ways. One impact of stress is that your body triggers a huge increase in cortisol and corticotropin-releasing hormone to help you to tackle the situation. Both of these chemicals can impact the levels of our reproductive hormones. In this article we are going to look at how stress can wreak havoc on our menstrual cycles. And, more specifically, whether stress could lead to a heavier period.\nWhat is stress?\nEverybody experiences stress at some point in their lives. In fact, at a low level, stress can be motivational and help us to accomplish more. In a nutshell, our body reacts to feeling threatened or under pressure – and stress is the result. However, there’s a fine balance. Excessive stress can be harmful to our mood and our bodies. Eventually, this can lead to burnout (physical, emotional and mental exhaustion), if you experience stress over a prolonged period.\nWhat is anxiety?\nAnxiety shares similar physical and emotional responses as stress but there is a key difference. Stress is in response to external causes such as an untenable workload or relationship difficulties. Anxiety is the internal response to stress, usually described as a ‘persistent feeling of apprehension or dread’ to scenarios in life that are not actually threatening. Also, you can still experience anxiety long after the stressful event has passed.\nThe menstrual cycle and stress\nStudies show that stress has a negative effect on various aspects of the menstrual cycle.  This is because the hormones that control the menstrual cycle are affected by cortisol, which is released when you’re experiencing stress. \nAs a result of the delicate balance of hormones being affected, your period can be affected in a few different ways. The most common responses are absent, very light or irregular periods. However, it can be quite difficult to clearly assess the effect of stress on the menstrual cycle in studies, because most research papers measure stress levels by self-reporting questionnaires. This is probably why there is such a range of results. \n\nIs there a link between stress and heavy periods?\nResearch is mixed here, with some sources stating that stress can cause heavy periods. One particular study concluded that high-stress levels can lead to longer cycles with heavier bleeding. However, most research tends to suggest that menstrual irregularities or painful periods are the most common impact of stress on periods. \nSo, to be frank, from the research it looks like we can’t yet identify the exact link between stress, menstrual irregularities and heavy periods. But, it certainly appears possible that changes such as heavier bleeding could certainly occur as a result of stress. \nIn any case, if you notice that your periods are heavier or more unpredictable, please don’t assume that this may be due to any stressful circumstances occurring in your life without proper investigation or medical advice. \nCan stress change the length of a menstrual cycle?\nAgain, the results are variable but some studies conclude that stress can have an effect on menstrual cycle length. Most commonly, this appears to be a shorter menstrual cycle length and cycle length irregularities in general. But, not to make it too confusing, there is also evidence suggesting that stress can cause longer cycle lengths too. \nCan stress contribute to menstrual pain?\nThe studies are a bit clearer here, phew! Pain is one aspect of the menstrual cycle which seems to have a strong link to mental wellbeing. Lots of studies show that stress can cause painful periods. In fact, one research paper showed that people who experienced stress 2 weeks before their periods were due were 2 to 4 times more likely to experience moderate to severe period pains. Pretty mind-blowing stuff. More specifically, one study showed that stress experienced in the first part of the menstrual cycle (follicular phase) was more likely to lead to painful periods than stress felt in the second part of the cycle (luteal phase). \n\nHow to manage stress around the time of your period?\nThere are loads of lifestyle tips which you can test out, to try to minimise stress around the time of your period. Not only should this help your general wellbeing, but can hopefully reduce the likelihood of stress related menstrual disturbances. \nWays to manage your stress include:\n\nRegular exercise\nHealthy diet\nPlenty of sleep (aim for 7-8 hours of shut eye a night)\nA support network of close friends and family to confide in\nReduce alcohol intake\n\nBut, one last point – please don’t be too hard on yourself! If you don’t feel up to exercising, or you have an insatiable chocolate craving, that’s totally fine..\nHow to treat heavy periods\nIn some cases, medication is not needed and the lifestyle changes may be able to make your flow more manageable. However, the types of treatments that you could be prescribed are:\n\nSome contraceptives can help with heavy bleeding, such as the combined contraceptive pill\nAnti-inflammatory painkillers e.g. mefenamic acid\nTranexamic acid can help to reduce the amount of bleeding by between 26-60% and is more effective than many of the other alternatives including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory painkillers. Plus, the side effects tend to be pretty mild.\n\nIf you are finding your periods to be heavy, regardless of whether you are treating them or not, investing in some period pants could be a sustainable way of managing them. WUKA and Modibodi period pants can be washed after each use and have been made to hold up to 3-4 tampons worth of blood in the lining.\nWhen to see a doctor\nIf you’ve been experiencing heavy periods for some time, and they mean that you have to make changes to your daily life – definitely talk to a healthcare professional, like your GP. Similarly, if you are in a lot of pain or you notice irregular bleeding, speaking to a healthcare professional would be the best bet.\nIf you have any burning questions about contraception or heavy periods, book an appointment with one of The Lowdown’s women’s health GPs – they can talk you through a range of management options!\nOne final tip: make sure you jot down any patterns around your bleeding. Building up a few cycles worth of information will be a really useful tool to take to your GP!\n\n\n\n\nEmma is a Pharmacology & Physiology graduate with a huge passion for women’s health.

Some hormonal contraceptives will help these symptoms, but in some cases they may be associated with side effects such as mood swings, acne and weight gain.\nIf you want to weigh up your options and find the best birth control for you, then look no further than this guide comparing the benefits and side effects of the two types of contraceptive pills: the combined pill and the progestogen-only pill (aka mini-pill).\nThe main difference between the two is that the combined pill contains two hormones, oestrogen and progestogen, whereas the progestogen-only pill just contains progestogen.\n\nWhat is the best contraceptive pill for preventing pregnancy?\nWhen we look at how effective a contraceptive pill is we refer to ‘typical’ and ‘perfect’ use. This can be confusing at first, so we’ve come up with an easy to understand in our clinical effectiveness guide. The effectiveness of both types of contraceptive pills is similar. If you look at 100 sexually active pill users who take it for a year, with perfect use less than 1 will get pregnant. But if we look at typical use, around 7 or 8 will get pregnant during that year. \nIt is important to consider how well you will remember to take a pill every day when choosing which contraceptive is best for you (but there are apps available to help you remember to take your pill!). We recommend taking your pill when you do something routinely every day, like brushing your teeth, to help build up the habit.\n\nBest contraceptive pill for acne?\nAcne is a common problem in many teenagers as during puberty changes in your hormones can result in changes to your skin, like excess oil. However, acne doesn’t just occur during puberty and can be common in your 20s and 30s.\nThe combined contraceptive pill can improve acne for many individuals as it helps control some of the hormonal changes which can lead to increased grease production in the skin. The best combined pills for acne are ones that help reduce androgen hormones. These include a progestogen called drospirenone, which can be found in Yasmin, Lucette and Eloine. These pills are all available to buy directly from The Lowdown. For more detailed information on managing skin conditions with the pill, check out our detailed guide on the best contraceptive pill for acne.\nOne of the side effects of the progestogen-only pill is that it may cause or worsen acne (although there’s not much evidence confirming this). However, most people won’t notice a change in their skin with this method. Check out our contraception reviews to see what our community have to say about the mini pill and acne!\n\nBest contraceptive for mood swings?\nIf you’re in hormonal hell, we’ve got you – check out our guide on how contraception can affect mood for the detailed version, or keep reading for an overview. For some people, their natural hormone cycle causes mood swings which can have an impact on their quality of life. For others, they feel the hormones in contraceptives can lead to changes in their mood and mental wellbeing.\nSome people suffer from mood swings and emotional changes linked to the menstrual cycle, aka premenstrual syndrome (PMS). In extreme cases, this is known as premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) where individuals may experience mood swings, depression, anxiety, extreme anger and even suicidal thoughts. In both of these situations, the combined pill can help reduce the symptoms, especially when used continuously to reduce hormonal fluctuations.\n\nWhat pill is best if I am overweight?\nBeing overweight does not necessarily mean you are not healthy. Unfortunately, in the world of contraception there are strict guidelines about using certain pills when you have a BMI over a certain level. \nFor those with a BMI of 35 and over, it is advised that progestogen-only pills are safer to use than combined pills. This is because having a higher BMI and using the combined contraceptive pill carries an increased risk of strokes, blood clots and heart attacks. Therefore other progestogen-only or non-hormonal contraceptive options will be considered safer for you. \nProgestogen-only pill brands include: Lovima, Aizea, Cerazette, Cerelle, Desogestrel, Desomono, Feanolla, Hana, Micronor, Norgeston, Noriday and Zelleta.\n\nWhat pill is best for heavy periods?\nBoth the progestogen-only pill and combined pill can help with heavy periods. It can take up to three months to notice these benefits, and the pill may cause irregular bleeding or spotting during this time.  \nAt the time of reviewing, 43% of Lowdown users said the progestogen-only pill stopped their periods and 48% of combined pill users found it made them lighter. So dependent on whether you want your periods to stop altogether or just be made lighter you can choose which suits you best. Remember that you can use the combined pill continuously which can also mean you avoid having a monthly bleed.\n\nWhat pill is the best for period pain?\nPeriod pain can have a significant effect on on your life and may mean you miss out on work, education or your social life. In some cases there might be reasons for period related pain like endometriosis or adenomyosis. The combined pill can help to reduce pain associated with periods especially when it is used continuously or with less breaks for bleeding.\n\nWhich contraceptive pill is best for migraines?\nIf you suffer from migraines with aura, you should avoid the combined pill. Instead, it would be best to consider a progestogen-only  – such as the Lovima pill – or non hormonal contraceptive method.\n‘Aura’ is a term used to describe any sort of neurological disturbance, which can appear before the headache or other symptoms of a migraine. A visual aura is a visual change like flashing lights which happens with or before the migraine.\nTaking the combined pill increases your risk of having a stroke if you suffer from migraines with aura so is not advised. If you have migraines but no aura, you can still use the combined pill with caution if you don’t want to use other methods or they’re not suited to you. For more information and advice, check our our full guide to headaches, migraines and contraception.\n\nWhat birth control pill can I take at my age?\nIf you’re under 50, do not have any health conditions, and do not have other risk factors such as smoking, diabetes or being overweight, you can safely take both types of birth control pill. However, if you are over 50 the risks associated with the combined pill tend to outweigh the benefits, and you will be advised to switch to an alternative like the progestogen-only pill. Check out our guide to contraception in your 40s and 50s for more advice on which contraceptive may be best suited to you.\nWhat pill can I take if I’ve just given birth?\nYou can get pregnant as early as 3 weeks after giving birth, even if you are breastfeeding and have not restarted your periods. Experts recommend a 12 month gap between having a baby and conceiving again, as this helps reduce complications such as future premature delivery or low birth weight.\nYou can safely use the progestogen-only pill straight away after delivery. It should ideally be started less than 3 weeks after birth, before you can become pregnant again. If the combined pill is your contraception of choice then it can safely be started from 6 weeks after delivery. Check out our full guide to postpartum contraception options, written by our Medical Director Dr Fran (as she was going into labour!).\nWhat pill can I take if I’m breastfeeding?\nIf you’re breastfeeding, you can take the progestogen-only pill straight away and can use the combined pill from when your baby is 6 weeks old. \n\nWhat contraceptive pills will affect my sex drive?\nSex drive is a difficult thing to measure, therefore it may require a bit of trial and error to find the right contraceptive pill for you. Some birth control pills might lower your sex drive while others can improve it, but this can vary from person to person and may not depend on the pill. Progestogen-only methods seem to have a higher impact on reducing sex drive, but it is an area which needs more research and a better understanding. We do a deep dive on this subject in our blog.\nMany things in life can affect our sex drive, not just contraception, and our resident sex coach Lucy has created a guide of practical tips and solutions when you’ve lost your libido. You can also book an appointment with Lucy, a certified sex coach, for further advice.\nWhen it comes to the contraception, at the time of reviewing a reduction in sex drive seems to be highest among users of progestogen-only hormonal contraception – with 51% of progestogen pill users, 51% of implant and 56% of injection reviewers reporting a loss of sex drive.\n\nContraceptive pill risks and side effects\nEvery contraceptive pill may have side effects that will vary from person to person. Some side effects take a couple of weeks to subside, and most resolve by 3 months as your body adapts to the pill. \nIf you are a first time pill user, you may want to try combined pills Microgynon, Rigevidon, Ovranette or Levest as they have a lower risk of blood clots than other combined pills, and are usually what a healthcare professional will prescribe first time. You can buy Microgynon and all other pill types here at The Lowdown if you already know which one you want to try!\nHere’s a quick overview of some side effects from each pill type reported by our community (at the time of reviewing):\n Combined pillProgestogen-only pillTender breasts44%45%Vaginal discharge33731%Enlarged breasts40%26%Period like cramping34%37%Vaginal dryness32%27%\nSo which birth control pill will suit me best?\nThere’s no perfect contraceptive pill unfortunately, and experiences differ from person to person.

        "Title": "The dos and don&#8217;ts of using lubricant",
        "Content": "\nIf you’ve never used lubricant before, the wealth of information about the stuff on the internet can feel pretty overwhelming. The truth, though, is that it’s surprisingly easy to use. Simply put, you just have to figure out which lube is right for you, get your hands on some and then, well… get down to it. \nThat being said, there are a few things that are helpful to know before using lubricant for the first time, so let’s run through some of the do’s and don’ts of how to use lubricant. \nWhen to use lubricant\nLubricant can be used whenever the need arises – and even when it doesn’t. Whether or not you experience vaginal dryness or enjoy anal sex, it’s a myth that lube is restricted only to certain forms of physical intimacy. Using lubrication can increase female pleasure regardless of the type of sex you’re having, so if you’re asking whether it’s appropriate for your personal situation – it most likely is.\nWhen not to use lubricant\nThere isn’t really a specific situation in which lubricant isn’t appropriate (although your great aunt’s 90th birthday party, for example, is probably not the ideal moment to whip out a tube). Lubricant is great for solo sex, penile-vaginal sex, anal-vaginal sex, vaginal-vaginal sex, and oral sex – in fact, research shows that female sexual pleasure improved across different types of sex when using lubricant compared to not using any at all. And just a quick reminder: sex should be comfortable (at a minimum!) for everyone involved, and you should never feel pressured into having sex that won’t feel good for you. If lube increases your enjoyment of sex, that’s the only reason you need to use it.\nThere are some caveats, though, particularly when it comes to the type of lubricant you use and the type of sex you’re having, so if you’re wondering how to use lubricant for the first time, we’ve got you covered.\nHow to use lubricant safely\nWarm it in your hands first\nIt can be tempting to just apply lube directly to the area you want it, but it’s actually better to squeeze it into your hands first and rub them together to warm it through. This makes the lube closer to your body temperature, and will give you less of a shock than squeezing it on directly at room-temperature.\nConsider your clean-up routine\nIt might not be what immediately springs to mind when you’re getting in the mood, but what you do post-sex is also important (bonus advice: pee as soon as poss to avoid a urinary tract infection). Both oil and silicone-based lubricants require soap to be removed, as they won’t just rinse away with water. Soap can be irritating to the delicate skin of the vulva and vagina, and can disrupt your vagina’s natural balance of bacteria, potentially leaving you more prone to thrush or bacterial vaginosis. This goes for intimate washes, too, by the way. If you have sensitive skin, it might be wise to opt for a water-based lubricant instead, which will rinse right off with some lukewarm water.\n\nShower sex\nIf you’re planning on getting water involved during sex, oil- or silicone-based lube is probably your best shot. Like we said earlier, water-based lube washes away with water, so won’t be much use in the shower. It is, however, safer in terms of slip risk. Oil- and silicone-based lubes can make surfaces very slippy, so be super careful when you’re using them in the shower. \nAnal sex\nThe anus, unlike the vagina or mouth, doesn’t have its own natural lubricant. You’ll want to be extra generous when using lube for anal sex, and will want to apply it to both the outside and inside of the anus as well as onto whatever you’ll be inserting – be it a sex toy, penis or other body part.\nWhat to avoid when using lubricant\nDon’t ingest lubricant\nThere are so many different brands of lubricant, with multitudes of added ingredients (some, for example, have benzocaine as an ingredient, which causes a numbing effect which aims to make sex last longer). Because of this, we can’t tell you whether a certain type – like water-based, for example – is safer to ingest than another. Generally speaking, ingesting a small amount of any personal lubricant shouldn’t cause anything more than a bit of tummy upset, but always check the packaging for more specific instructions.\nStay away from Vaseline and bathroom staples\nThanks to its presence in most people’s bathroom cupboards, Vaseline has landed itself a bit of a reputation for its lubricating properties. But that doesn’t mean you should use it during sex – it’s more irritating than other options, stains, can damage condoms and increases your risk of infection. With so many other choices out there, it’s best to steer clear of petroleum-based products, slippery as they may be. This also goes for other bathroom staples like shower gel, shampoo and conditioner! These products are for external use only and away from intimate areas.\nDon’t use silicone-based lubricants with silicone sex toys\nSilicone-based lubricants can interact with your silicone sex toys, causing them to degenerate over time. This degeneration makes the surface of the sex toy more porous, rendering it harder to clean and increasing your risk of introducing bacteria and infection into your body. If you’re looking for a lube that’s safe to use with sex toys, something like Yes Organics water-based lubricant ticks all the boxes – get it from Amazon!\nDon’t use oil-based lubricants with condoms\nThis is something that very few people know, but which (to us, at least) feels like a Pretty Big Deal. Oil-based lubricants can damage the latex in condoms, sometimes even causing them to break. If condoms are your chosen contraception method, or if you’re using them to protect yourself against STIs, stay well away from oil-based lube, and opt for silicone or water-based instead.\nBy design, any lubricant causes extra slippage, so be careful with condoms in general – check regularly that they’re still properly in place and haven’t slipped off. \nSpare a thought for your bedsheets \nIf you’re particularly attached to your linens (or clothes, towels, or any fabric in your immediate vicinity, really) you’ll want to choose your lube wisely. Oil- and silicone-based lubricants can stain unless you’re careful not to spill – and really, what better way to ruin the mood than to request that involved parties please be mindful of your Egyption cotton duvet cover? Water-based lubes wash away and won’t leave a mark, so are definitely a better choice if you value your soft furnishings. Alternatively, you could lay a lesser-liked towel down to catch any potential stains.\nWhat is a safe lubricant to use?\nWhen used correctly, lubricants are generally safe, but you should think about your own circumstances – like whether you’re using condoms or silicone sex toys – before you just pick a bottle off the shelf. If you’re looking for a great all-rounder, we highly recommend Yes Organics water-based personal lubricant. It’s pH balanced, moisturising and long-lasting, and really, what more could you ask for? Get it from Amazon.\nWe’ll only ever recommend products to you that we truly believe in, and this lube absolutely passes the test.\n\n\nMary Hargreaves is a writer and author with a passion for women’s reproductive health.

        "Title": "What are the different types of lubricant?",
        "Content": "\n✅ If you think this blog sound interesting, make sure to check out our newsletter for more:\n\nThere are a few reasons why you might want to use lubricant during sex, from vaginal dryness caused by contraceptive hormones or the menopause to trying something new, but in our opinion, you don’t need a reason at all. \nLubricant is a great addition to anybody’s sex life, be it for solo moments or time with a partner – it’s just a matter of choosing the right one for you. Research has shown that lubricant improves sexual pleasure no matter what kind of sex you’re having, so all that’s left to do now is decide which type is right for you. \nAnd if you’re still not convinced, we’ve waxed lyrical about the multitude of reasons to use lube right here (seriously, we’re quite passionate about it). \nWhat is personal lubricant?\nPersonal lubricants are lubricants used during sexual acts. They facilitate movement and reduce friction between one body part and another, or between a body part and a sex toy. There are three different types of personal lubricant: oil-based, water-based and silicone-based. Here, we’ll take a look at all three, when they should be used and who they’re suitable for.\nTypes of lubricant\nIt can be hard to know which lubricant is right for you, and easy to assume that any will do. But in fact, oil-based, water-based and silicone-based lubricants each come with their own list of pros and cons, which are important to know before you buy. \nOil-based lubricant\nOil-based lubricants have (you guessed it) oil as their lubricating ingredient, which makes them a brilliant choice for use in the shower, as they won’t rinse away very easily. They can also be used as a massage oil, which is handy! \nYou’ll need soap to get rid of any remnants of oil-based lubricant, though, so just be wary of this – soap (and yes, this includes intimate washes!) can irritate the vulva and vagina, disrupt your vagina’s natural balance and can make you more likely to develop bacterial vaginosis or thrush. Oil-based lubricants can also stain your clothes and sheets (think of the horror of dropping a roast potato down a brand new white top) so that’s something to bear in mind. Research has also found that oil-based lubricants can increase the quantity of Candida (the fungus responsible for thrush) in the vagina.\nA big, lights-flashing, sirens-sounding alert here: oil-based lubricants can interact with the latex in condoms, breaking or damaging them and causing them not to work. So be extra careful which lubricant you opt for if condoms are your chosen contraceptive method. \n\nWater-based lubricant\nWater-based lubricants are less long-lasting than both oil-based and silicone-based lubricants, and wash off in water, so aren’t ideal for use in the shower. You’ll need to reapply a water-based lubricant more frequently than you would other types of lubricant, so that’s something to consider if you want to avoid interruption. \nThat being said, water-based lubricants are safe for anybody to use, won’t stain your clothing or sheets and don’t interact with condoms or sex toys. They’re less likely to cause a reaction in people with sensitive skin than oil-based lubes, particularly as they don’t need soap to be rinsed away, so there won’t be as much disruption to your vagina’s natural balance of bacteria during clean-up.  \nYou can buy Yes water-based lube from Amazon. We’re in love with this lube – it’s non-irritating, pH balanced and moisturising to boot – and we’re obsessed with how long-lasting it is, too. This is an affiliate link but we only recommend products we’ve tried or love. \nSilicone-based lubricant\nLike oil-based lubricant, silicone-based lubricant doesn’t rinse away easily with water, and you’ll need soap to wash it off. This makes it great for use in the shower, but remember that soap can be irritating to the delicate skin of your vulva and vagina, so if you have sensitive skin in this area, this is something to consider. Silicone-based lubricants can also stain, so watch out for your bed sheets and clothes. \nUnlike oil-based lubricants, silicone-based lube is safe to use with condoms, and is brilliant for sensitive skin. They do come with a word of warning for your sex toys, though. Over time, silicone-based lube can deteriorate silicone toys, so it’s probably best to keep it away from that eye-wateringly expensive vibrator your friend convinced you to buy after too much after-work wine (and which you’re now not sure you could live without). This damage can cause abrasions on the surface of the sex toy, making it harder to clean and increasing the amount of bacteria that it could carry. Not ideal.\nAdvice for vaginal dryness\nIf you’re having trouble with vaginal dryness and think it might be caused by your contraception, we have a team of brilliantly talented doctors at hand. Each of our doctors have a Diploma in sexual and reproductive health, so you can count on them to know their stuff when it comes to lube, vaginal dryness and contraception. Book a consultation at a time that suits you, and receive a detailed action plan after your appointment.\n\nMary Hargreaves is a writer and author with a passion for women’s reproductive health.

        "Title": "6 tips for overcoming orgasm anxiety",
        "Content": "\n✅ If you think you’ll find this blog interesting and helpful, make sure to check out our newsletter for more:\n\nWhat is orgasm anxiety and how can you overcome it?\nWe’ve all been there… you’re getting in the mood, getting closer and closer. But then, something stops you from fully letting go. Even though reaching the big O isn’t the be-all and end-all of sex, this can cause some frustration. Enter – orgasm anxiety. \nDon’t worry, it’s way more common than you think, but life is too short to not fully enjoy sex, so we’re here to help. \n\nFirstly, what is an orgasm?\nAn orgasm is when sexual pleasure intensifies and reaches a climax. Testosterone and oxytocin are released, which makes people feel happy, sleepy, and relaxed – all of the good feelings. \nWe all experience orgasms¹ in a variety of ways, feelings and sensations. It’s basically peak arousal and that embodies itself in different ways depending on the person. This can be through muscles contracting, heart beating super fast, and whatever else feels like an orgasm to you. Remember that your orgasm can look and feel entirely different from someone else’s and that is totally normal. \nIt’s also common to cum (ejaculate) or squirt at the same time as you climax but not always. Our genitals are pretty amazing, if not unpredictable.\nSigns and symptoms of sexual anxiety\nYou may notice sexual anxiety in a few ways;\n\nIntrusive thoughts and dread when thinking about intimacy \nFear of letting go sexually\nNot feeling present during sex and disassociating\nStruggling to cum or ‘cum-block’\nOther physical symptoms such as an upset stomach, racing heartbeat (not in the good way), and sweating \n\nWhat is orgasm anxiety?\nOrgasm anxiety is nervousness and stress when reaching climax during sex. \nThe main cause of orgasm anxiety is the pressure to ‘finish’ as a means of having ‘successful sex’ and it affects all genders. This could be because some have considered sex as a failure if not reaching climax but it’s much more complicated than this. Hyper fixating on orgasms makes it more difficult to have one, ironically. We work hard, but anxiety works harder.\nWhat can cause orgasm anxiety?\nOrgasm anxiety² can be caused by a multitude of things, such as;\n\nPressure from yourself and/or your partner to ‘finish’ \nExperiences of sexual trauma in the past \nFeelings of nervousness or worry \nPoor sexual education and bad role models \nShame or stigma around pleasure\nGeneralised anxiety disorder and other mental health conditions\n\n\nHow can I overcome sexual anxiety?\nAccept that orgasms aren’t the only reason we have sex\nSex is a beautiful, fulfilling and joyful thing. Even though orgasms are one way of your body telling you it was good, there’s more to sex than climaxing. \nThe other reasons to have sex are endless. You can have sex to: \n\nExplore what you enjoy and learn more about your body\nGet closer to a partner \nRelieve stress\nGet over your ex 😉\nHave a baby (or actively avoid having a baby)\n\nThere’s a whole host of reasons to have sex – ultimately, because you want to. At the end of the day, sex should be fun. Sex is not a race to the finish line, it’s more like a journey to overall pleasure and comfort. Once you embrace this, your sex life will improve. \nTry something new \nOne of the reasons you may be struggling to reach peak pleasure could be because you’re not giving yourself the full treatment. Due to lack of proper sex education, we often aren’t told the full story on orgasms. This puts us at a disadvantage, so it’s no wonder we get nervous about them. \nOur Sex, Libido and Orgasms webinar taught us that there is something called the ‘orgasm gap’³ among heterosexual cis-gendered couples. 95% men usually or always orgasm, but for women this is only 65% (in long term relationships). For women having casual sex, it goes down even lower to 18%.\nSo what does that mean? It means that if you’re struggling to orgasm, you’re not the only one! But it also means that penetration without a doubt advantages the male anatomy. Only 20% of people with vulvas can orgasm from penetrative sex alone, so it’s time to mix it up. Time to educate yourself and your partner on this and see where it goes.\nDon’t be afraid to try out some new positions and see what you like. It could be that something you’ve never tried before is about to be your go-to orgasm position. Other stimulation areas include the nipples, anus, and the vagina/vulva. \n\nStop faking it and try having sex with yourself first \nWe can’t stress this enough – STOP faking your orgasms. It’s not fair on you or your partner. Plus, if you’re having sex with cis hetero-men, they could really do with being humbled once in a while.\nWomen are statistically much more likely to orgasm from manual clitoral stimulation and receiving oral sex, than by having penetrative sex. We have over 8,000 nerve endings on our clitoris so why were were not told about this during sex ed? \nCheck out Le clitoris, a 3 minute animated documentary on Youtube that our brilliant sex coaches shared with us.\nTake some time alone to yourself and eliminate the pressure of getting there with a partner. That way there’s no one else to impress but yourself. If you are able to achieve an orgasm alone, you’ll be one step closer to climaxing with someone else too.\n\nLearn how to switch off \nAs well as feeling relaxed AFTER climaxing, orgasms typically occur when we are more relaxed during the act itself, too. \nOne way to overcome anxiety generally is by learning to switch off. Set up the right conditions for relaxation and transition out of the stress of the day before engaging in sexual play.\nMeditation is a great way to practice easing your mind⁴. If you’re able to mimic that meditative state of calm when getting under the covers, you’ll be more likely to block out intrusive thoughts and truly let go.\nConsider how your contraception affects your sex drive \nYour contraception could actually be somewhat to blame for lack of sex drive. Though there is no concrete evidence to say certain contraceptives affect your libido, some hormonal contraceptives have been known to cause vaginal dryness and mood swings, amongst other things. While those side effects may not be a direct link to your sex life, it could have an indirect influence on your ability to enjoy sex and get to that big O.\nThis slide from our sex, libido and orgasms webinar illustrates the top rated methods of contraception on The Lowdown, and how reviewers said it affected their sex drive:\n\nIf you think your contraception choice has had some kind of affect on your sex life, book an appointment with one of our lovely doctors to discuss the other side effects you may be experiencing.\nSpeak to a sex coach for more advice\nIf you still feel anxious around sex and orgasming, book an appointment with our resident sex coach Lucy in a non-judgemental, relaxed space. We offer empowering support and advice to help you get the most out of your sex life. \nOur sex coach service focuses on sex drive, pleasure, communication and confidence. With Lucy’s guidance, you will be able to get to the bottom of where your orgasm anxiety comes from, and help you take steps in the right direction to enjoy sex.\n\n",

        "Title": "IUS vs IUD &#8211; what&#8217;s the difference and which is best?",
        "Content": "\n\nWe know that contraception can be a confusing one, and when it comes to the coil – it’s certainly no exception. From IUD to IUS, no wonder we’re all left rubbing our heads when it comes to decision time. The main difference between the two is their makeup and how they work in the body.In this article we will outline the key differences in the IUS vs the IUD to help you decide which contraceptive coil is right for you.\nWhat is an IUD/IUS?\nThe coil is a small T-shaped device made mostly of plastic, that is inserted into the uterus to act as contraception. There are two types of coil to choose from, the Intrauterine Device (IUD), which releases copper and Intrauterine System (IUS) which releases a hormone called progestogen, but both work to prevent pregnancy.\nBoth types of contraceptive coils must be inserted by a trained healthcare provider and can last anywhere between three to ten years, depending on which type or brand and can be easily removed at any time. The Mirena coil is a popular brand of IUS coil – check out our comparison of the Mirena vs the Copper coil for more info.\nHow do the coils work?\nThe main difference between the IUD and IUS is how they prevent pregnancy.\nThe IUD is a copper coil (non-hormonal coil) that prevents pregnancy by blocking sperm from reaching the egg. It does this by releasing tiny amounts of copper into the body, which are ‘toxic’ for both sperm and eggs.\nDue to the presence of the copper, the sperm cannot survive in the cervix or the womb and therefore cannot reach the egg. It can also delay the egg from reaching the womb. If the sperm and egg did meet, the presence of the copper IUD prevents a fertilised egg from implanting in the lining of the womb, therefore preventing pregnancy.\nCheck out our copper IUD reviews on The Lowdown website.\nThe IUS is a hormonal coil that prevents pregnancy through releasing the hormone progestogen into the womb, that works by thickening the cervical mucus to prevent the sperm entering your reproductive tract and thinning out the womb lining so an egg can’t implant to grow into a pregnancy.\nThe IUS can also stop ovulation for some people (around 25%), while for others ovulation will continue as usual.\nHow hormones in the IUS work\nDifferent to the contraceptive pill or other forms of contraception, the hormones in the IUS are thought to act more locally, which means they are concentrated in the womb, with lower levels of progestogen in the blood.\nThis means the hormones may be less likely to cause negative symptoms, such as mood changes, that may occur with other hormonal contraceptive methods – this could be why it’s one of our community’s most popular forms of birth control!\nIUS and IUD insertion\nIt’s always good to arrange an appointment with your doctor before getting the IUD or IUS fitted so you can discuss which one would be best suited to you.\nBoth the IUD and IUS need to be inserted by a trained healthcare provider. Before fitting, they may carry out some simple tests, including:\n\nChecking the size and position of your womb\nChecking for an possible STIs and treating with antibiotics\nA pregnancy test\n\nThe entire appointment takes around 15-20 minutes but the actual insertion is often much  quicker. The vagina will be held open with a small speculum, the same way as it is during a smear test, and the coil is inserted through the cervix into the womb. Your healthcare provider will use local anaesthetic to make this more comfortable.\nOccasionally, some clinics recommend a check up six weeks after insertion to check the coil and review any problems. You should be taught how to check your coil is in place by feeling the fine threads which hang down from the cervix into the top of the vagina. If you’re confident doing this you don’t always need to attend a check up appointment.\nIUS and IUD removal\nIt’s good to know that the coil can be removed at any time – but this must be done by a doctor or nurse so you’ll need to make an appointment. Your normal fertility should return immediately once the coil has been removed. If you don’t wish to get pregnant and have had sex in the last 7 days, your doctor may advise you to delay removing your coil, depending on whether you are stopping or switching contraception. The removal procedure is usually simple and quicker than when inserted. It is removed by your doctor or nurse by gently pulling on the threads, making the T shape fold up and allowing it to be easily pulled out of the womb.\nBenefits of the IUD and IUS\n\nYou don’t have to worry about remembering your contraception every day or every time you have sex\nYou don’t have to think about it until it is time for it to be replaced, this can be between 3 to 10 years depending on the coil type\nThe IUD is effective as soon as it’s been fitted, the IUS can be effective immediately if fitted within the first 7 days of the start of your menstrual cycle (Otherwise it takes 7 days after fitting to be effective against pregnancy during which time you’ll need to use additional contraception such as condoms)\nNormal fertility returns once it has been removed\nBoth coils are safe to use while breastfeeding\nNeither coil is affected by other medicines in the way that other forms of contraception like the pill might be\n\nIUS vs IUD: your period\nThe way the coil affects your period is different for individual women, and will depend on the type of coil fitted.\n\nThe IUD may cause heavier periods that may last longer in the first few months, but not always.\n\n\nPeriods with the IUS are usually lighter, shorter and less painful. The IUS can cause irregular bleeding, often light irregular spotting or sometimes stop periods altogether. This is not harmful at all but can take some time getting used to.\n\nSide effects of the IUS and IUD\n\nYou may get light bleeding and tummy cramps for a few days after the coil is fitted. If you feel unwell, have severe lower tummy pain, smelly or green discharge, or other concerns, go back to the clinic where your coil was fitted or contact your doctor\nSide effects with the IUS can include acne, breast tenderness or headaches but these usually settle after a few months\nSome women report vaginal discharge\n\nIUD vs IUS… what do the reviews say?\n“Except for heavier periods, I am so happy to have found a non-hormonal and worry-free contraceptive that allows me to have a natural cycle.” – IUD“Still fairly new to this method, but I swapped from the copper coil and it’s been a massive relief in that my periods are no longer extremely heavy and I don’t have raging mood swings (or ones that are as bad, at least)” – IUSCheck out our IUS reviews and IUD reviews at The Lowdown.

        "Title": "What’s the best contraceptive pill for acne?",
        "Content": "\n✔️If you think you’ll find this blog informative, you can subscribe to our newsletter for more:\n\nAnnoyingly, women are more likely than men to be affected by acne in adulthood,¹ suggesting hormones may play a key role. It’s perhaps not surprising that many women find changing their birth control affects their skin. In this article, we look at the contraceptive methods – such as the pill, patch or copper coil – that can help or hinder your efforts to bust blemishes.\nWhat is acne?\nAcne is a really common skin condition – but that doesn’t mean it’s not distressing. It causes black, white or red spots to appear on the face. Some people get acne on their back or their chest too.\nWhile it’s true that acne is most common in young people (around 8 in 10 teenagers develop it at some point),² it can affect older people too.\nThere are loads of myths about what causes spots. Some people think it’s to do with eating certain foods (such as chocolate or fizzy drinks) or poor hygiene, but this is generally not supported by evidence. Specific diets aren’t recommended to treat acne but a healthy balanced diet is likely to be best for your skin.³ Avoiding oil based products and removing makeup at the end of every day is likely to help too.³ However the best explanation for acne is hormonal changes and that’s why it tends to flare up during and after the already rocky ride that is puberty.\nHow do hormones affect our skin?\nOur skin glands are really sensitive to hormones called androgens. Androgens are sometimes called male hormones, but both men and women produce them. Learn more in our androgens blog. Androgens cause glands in your skin to produce excess amounts of oil (called sebum) and also thicken hair follicles, causing pores in the skin to block. Excess sebum interacts with usually harmless bacteria on the skin, causing spots. \nAcne is also a common symptom of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) – a condition where the ovaries produce more androgens and that can also cause irregular periods and excessive unwanted hair.⁴ See our webinar on PCOS and chat to your GP if the symptoms sound familiar. \nOestrogen, one of the main hormones involved in the menstrual cycle, has the opposite effect on sebum production. Experts think oestrogen reduces sebum by preventing the ovaries from making androgens. Noticed you’re more prone to spots at certain times of the month? You’re not alone. Your menstrual cycle can have a profound effect on your skin. This might explain why some women experience acne just before their period when oestrogen levels drop.\nProgesterone is the other main hormone involved in the menstrual cycle. It is not yet clear how progesterone affects acne. But some studies and anecdotal evidence suggest it can make skin problems worse.\nHormonal contraception therefore might affect your skin. The general rule is that ‘combined’ methods containing both oestrogen and progestin (a synthetic form of progesterone) can improve acne, while progestogen-only contraception might lead to spots or worsen acne in some people. \nBut remember, it’s not a one-size-fits-all thing. As you’ll see from our user-generated reviews, some people find their contraception gives them a clearer complexion, while others find the same method makes things worse! \nWhat’s the best combined pill for acne?\nThe good news is that people who take the combined pill often see an improvement when it comes to acne. Some people are actually prescribed the combined pill to clear up their skin even if they don’t need contraception. \nStudies show that women with acne who take the combined pill tend to see an improvement in the number of spots and the severity of their acne compared to individuals who aren’t on hormonal contraception.⁵ ⁶ \nHowever it can take a few months of use to see a noticeable improvement in your skin after you start taking the combined pill. Some people even find their skin gets worse in the first 2-3 weeks after they start taking a new combined pill, but this usually settles down and the best skin results are seen at around 3 months.\nYou can use our contraception recommender tool, to help guide you to the best contraceptive for you:\n\nAnti-androgen pills such as Yasmin for acne \nThere’s not a tonne of research on which brands of the combined pill are most likely to improve acne, but scientists think the type of progestogen it contains might make a difference. One study⁷ found pills that containing a progestogen called drospirenone are the most helpful for preventing acne. It also concluded that pills containing levonorgestrel and norethindrone (also called norethisterone) were the least helpful.\nPill brands containing drospirenone include Yasmin, Eloine and Lucette. Drospirenone is known as an anti-androgen because it reduces the effect of male hormones such as testosterone.\n\nYou can view more information about the different brands of pills on our products pages, such as Yasmin side effects here.\nShould I take Dianette for acne?\nYou might have heard that the pill Dianette can help treat acne. This pill contains a progestogen called cyproterone acetate, which like drospirenone, can block the effects of androgens. Dianette used to be licensed as contraception in the UK, but the rare risk of developing blood clots in the legs or lungs with Dianette is higher than other contraceptive pills. For this reason, Dianette is no longer prescribed purely for contraceptive reasons.⁸\nDoctors will sometimes prescribe Dianette for treating moderate to severe acne and excess facial or body hair in young women, often when other treatment options have failed. Dianette provides contraception in women who require it to treat these conditions, but it will not be prescribed purely as a contraceptive.⁸ You can see reviews for Dianette here.\nWill the patch or ring affect my skin?\nThe contraceptive patch (such as Evra) and the vaginal ring (NuvaRing) prevent pregnancy by releasing small amounts of both progesterone and oestrogen into the body. Like the combined pill, these contraceptive methods may improve acne for some women.\nOne study⁹ found women who used the vaginal ring even experienced less acne than women taking a combined pill. But more research is needed on the impact of these forms of contraception on the skin.\nDoes the progestogen-only pill cause acne?\nPopular brands of progestogen-only pills (also called the mini-pill) include Cerazette, Cerelle and the Hana contraceptive pill. This type of contraception doesn’t contain any oestrogen.\nSome women find the mini-pill has lots of advantages – particularly if they experienced side effects or can no longer take the combined pill. But unfortunately, progestogen-only pills haven’t been found to improve acne. The very limited research evidence means an association between the progestogen-only pill and acne can’t be confirmed, however we know some women find taking the mini-pill makes their skin worse or triggers acne.¹⁰ This could be because the synthetic progestin in the mini pill may bind to androgen receptors in the body to cause your skin to produce more pore-clogging sebum.\nResearch is similar for women who take the contraceptive injection or implant, which are also progestogen only contraceptive methods, with some users reporting worsening acne.¹¹ ¹²\nWill the hormonal coil affect my skin?\nThe hormonal coil (also know as the hormonal IUD or IUS), which includes brands such as the Mirena coil, slowly releases the progestogen levonorgestrel into your womb to prevent pregnancy. This method of contraception does not contain oestrogen. It’s great if you don’t want to have to think about contraception every day or every time you have sex and lasts for 6 years. The research is too limited to establish if acne is caused by the coil, however some women find they experience more acne after having a hormonal coil inserted, although this is likely to decrease with time.¹³ The amount of progestogen in the coil is much lower than that found in other progestogen only contraceptives like the mini pill, so theoretically there may be less of a noticeable impact on the skin although this hasn’t been proven in research.\nNon-hormonal contraceptives and acne \nIf you’ve sworn off hormonal contraceptives, rest assured that hormone-free methods such as the copper coil, condoms, or using an app like Natural Cycles, should not worsen acne in theory. \nHowever, if you’ve switched from a combined hormonal contraceptive (like the pill, the patch or vaginal ring) to a hormone-free option, you may notice new or worsen acne. That’s because the combined contraception you were previously taking may have been helping to keep breakouts at bay. \nOther treatments for acne besides contraception\nIf you’ve tried combined contraception containing both oestrogen and progestogen and found it doesn’t help your acne – or you can’t take the combined pill, patch or ring – speak to your GP to find out about other acne treatments that might help. Possible options include creams containing ingredients like benzoyl peroxide or retinoids. They might even recommend an antibacterial cream – or antibiotic tablets.\nDon’t suffer in silence. Acne sucks, but there are plenty of effective treatment options. Your pharmacist or GP should be able to help find the best one for you.\n\nThis blog can help you learn more about various contraception options, but it does not give medical advice. You should always speak to a nurse or doctor when making choices about contraception and before starting a new method.\nOne of The Lowdown’s fab Clinical Directors, Dr Melanie Davis-Hall BMBS (Hons) BMedSci (Hons) DFSRH MRCGP is a GP and a clinical editor for the British Medical Journal.

        "Content": "\nHave things felt a bit “off” in the bedroom recently? Maybe sex has dwindled because he’s stopped initiating and now you’re worried why he doesn’t want you sexually anymore. It can really hurt and you may feel confused because one of the main cultural messages we receive about sex is, “men want sex all the time”. So why doesn’t your boyfriend want to have sex with you? Is it your fault? Does he not find you attractive anymore? Is he cheating on you?! You may be seriously worried about your relationship right now, but all is not lost, there are many different reasons for him losing his sex drive¹ and often they have nothing to do with you or your relationship.\nNavigating sex and intimacy in a relationship can be a confusing at times, especially when you’re not sure why your partner doesn’t want to have sex. But it doesn’t have to be! If you‘d like to chat, I’m The Lowdown’s resident sex coach, and we can discuss everything from mismatched libidos, to a loss of intimacy, and lots in between.\nLet’s explore the most common signs he doesn’t want you sexually and what you can do about it.\nSigns he doesn’t want you sexually\n\nHe stops initiating sex and/or any kind of physical intimacy with you, like kissing, touching, or hugging\nWhen you try initiate sex or start touching him, he turns away, takes your hand off, or otherwise deflects your advances\nHe stops making eye contact with you or his body language is generally closed off, especially if you bring up the topic of intimacy or try to touch him\nIf you bring up the topic of sex, he changes the subject or deflects it. He is not open to talking about it or broaching the topic\nHe avoids spending time with you, for example, by overworking, spending more time online, going out with his mates, or “phubbing” you— i.e. ignoring you by going on his phone when you’re together\nHe’s partying harder and drinking more heavily\nHe seems checked out and less emotionally available. During sex he seems “not there”, almost like he’s on autopilot, and when you’re together he seems more closed off\nHe goes to bed before you, or a long time after you’ve gone to bed, so that one of you is asleep or distracted, taking sex off the menu\nThe sex you’re having has changed in a way that feels strange to you. When you do have sex, he’s trying to get it finished as soon as possible, he no longer gives you oral sex or spends time on foreplay, or he doesn’t make the same sounds or moves as usual\nSomething just doesn’t feel right to you when you’re having sex or when you’re physically intimate with each other. You can’t put your finger on it, but something feels different and your instincts are firing off that something feels wrong\nHe won’t let you see him naked or seems very self-conscious. He closes the door when he’s changing, he wears a t-shirt during sex, or he doesn’t want you to take his clothes off\nThere are other issues in your relationship. You’re arguing more, or you’re talking a lot less, he’s getting wound up over little things that didn’t bother him before, he’s not being physically affectionate anymore or doing the little considerate things he used to, like texting throughout the day\n\nGot more sex drive and libido questions?\nLucy is a certified sexologist and sex coach who is passionate about helping women and people with vulvas let go of sexual shame and hangups.

        "Title": "D-Mannose vs Cranberry for UTIs &#8211; Which is best?",
        "Content": "\nThis post contains Amazon affiliate links which we earn a small commission from. We only link to products our doctors have reviewed ❤️\nWhat is a UTI?\nUTI… the dreaded urinary tract infection. Usually it likes to make its presence known by causing an eye-watering sting while you wee, dull abdominal pain and the constant need to sprint to the loo! It seems unfair that something so common (it’s likely to affect at least  ⅓ of all women¹…lucky us) can have such irritating symptoms. \nThe first port of call for treatment is typically an antibiotic, but factors such as the rise of antibiotic resistance and unpleasant side effects have resulted in increasing interest in other possible treatment options. In this article, we’re going to compare one of the most long-standing home remedies for UTIs, the humble cranberry, with one of the newer kids on the block, D-mannose, which is available to buy directly from The Lowdown!\n\nA UTI is a collective term to describe an infection which involves the bladder, kidneys, ureter or urethra. Up to 90%of all cases are due to the bacteria Escherichia coli,² which is common in the urinary tract. Many of us experience recurrent UTIs, which is where you experience 2 UTIs in a 6 month period. In fact, studies suggest that there is a 27% chance³ of a second infection within six months after the first. \nIf you experience UTI symptoms, you may be asked to do a urine test to look for signs of infection. Depending on the result, the advice could be to take a painkiller to manage uncomfortable symptoms and to potentially take a prescribed short course of antibiotics (3 days is usually enough). However, antibiotics are not always needed and symptoms can resolve on their own⁴.  Sometimes, the recommendation is to wait 48 hours before taking the antibiotics to see if things improve without them. \nIt is important to note that if UTI symptoms rapidly worsen, or do not respond to treatments (such as antibiotics), within a couple of days it is important to contact your healthcare team as the infection can spread to the kidney and result in complications. Important signs of worsening infection⁵ include fever, vomiting and pain over the kidney area or loin.\nNow, time to take a bit of a diversion into cranberries and D-mannose. Let’s get stuck into how each of them can be beneficial, how they differ and which one might be best for you!\nIs D-mannose the same as cranberry?\nD-mannose is a type of sugar which is found in fruits and vegetables. It also naturally occurs in cranberries. So, if you take cranberry juice or capsules you will also be ingesting some D-mannose.\nWhen you take D-mannose, the body will get rid of it via the kidneys and then the urinary tract. D-mannose attaches to the e.coli bacteria (remember, this is the main culprit for UTIs), which prevents the bacteria from attaching to cells, multiplying and causing the infection. \nAs cranberry also contains D-mannose, some sources suggest that it treats infection in the same way. However, D-mannose that can be consumed via the diet⁶ is relatively low, so you wouldn’t be able to eat enough cranberries, peaches or even coffee grounds to consume an amount of D-mannose that could have a therapeutic effect!\nThere is, however, another compound within cranberries, known as proanthocyanidins (PACs), that could be beneficial in treating UTIs. The PACs appear to have a similar effect on e.coli, stopping the bacteria from attaching to the cells within the urinary tract. A 2010 study⁷ concluded that a daily dose of 36 mg of PACs or more had an optimal antibacterial effect in the urine.\n\nDifferences between D-mannose and cranberry\n*If you’re pregnant and experiencing UTI symptoms it is important to speak to a healthcare professional, especially if symptoms worsen or the infection isn’t responding to treatment.\n\nSo, D-mannose vs cranberry – which is best?\nIt’s often the way with medical research but caveat number one is that both D-mannose and cranberry treatments for UTIs need further study through well-designed clinical trials in order to make a more conclusive statement.\nBut, from the studies that are out there, and given the comparisons with antibiotics, there seem to be more significant results when evaluating the effects of D-mannose. Furthermore, while D-mannose seems to both prevent⁸ future infections and reduce⁹ symptoms of an active UTI, cranberries strengths appear to be more on the preventive side¹⁰.\nOne potential factor which limits the favourable results for cranberry is that there are no standard formulations. The benefits of the PACs have been well documented but because of the widely varying amounts of cranberry given to participants in studies, this may be why the results are mixed.\n\nCan I take cranberry and D-mannose together?\nYes, you certainly can take cranberry and D-mannose at the same time! One 2020 study¹¹ concluded that administering D-mannose with cranberry extract showed ‘an increase in effectiveness when used in combination with empirical treatment for uncomplicated UTIs.’ So, not only is it safe to take both together, but the overall treatment looks to be more effective.\n\nWhere can I buy D-mannose? \nAt the Lowdown we want to make life that bit easier for you, so you can now buy D-mannose capsules directly from us or get on Amazon.\n\n\nEmma is a Pharmacology & Physiology graduate with a huge passion for women’s health.

        "Title": "Mirena vs Copper coil: What&#8217;s the difference and which one is best?",
        "Content": "\n\n \nOnce you have decided what birth control method you would like to try (check out our contraception recommender tool to help you figure it out), choosing the brand and type of that particular contraceptive is a decision in itself. Luckily, our team of women’s health experts are on hand to help you decide if you’re really stuck. If you‘d like to chat to one of The Lowdown’s doctors about choosing the right type of coil for you right now, you can book an appointment here.\nTo help you make the best choice for you, and hopefully without having to conduct so much trial and error, here’s the lowdown on the ins and the outs (pun intended) of coil contraceptives.\nThe Mirena coil, is a brand of IUS which stands for intrauterine system. There are several types of IUS but for now, we shall focus on the Mirena. It is made of a white T-shaped frame made from a plastic called polyethylene, and can last for up to 8 years for contraception.\nThe Mirena coil releases levonorgestrel, a synthetic form of the hormone progesterone, similar to the natural form produced by your ovaries. It thickens the cervical mucus, which makes it more difficult for sperm to move through the opening in the cervix, and thins the lining of the womb so a fertilised egg is less likely to be able to implant itself. For some women (around a quarter) it may also stop ovulation.\nIt is inserted into your womb by a doctor a nurse at an appointment which you can book at your local sexual health clinic or some GP practices.\n\n\n\nCopper coil or IUD (non-hormonal) \nThe IUD is a small plastic and copper device that, like the Mirena coil, is T-shaped and is inserted into your womb.\nThe copper alters the cervical mucus, which makes it more difficult for sperm to reach an egg and survive. It can also stop a fertilised egg from being able to implant itself into the lining of the womb.\nThe copper coil can last from 5 years to up to 10 years depending on which make of coil you have.\nUnlike the Mirena coil, the Copper IUD is hormone free.\n \n \nSide by side coil comparisons\nPrices refer to how much each coil costs the NHS (as of September 2022)\nAdvantages of both coils\n\nThe copper IUD protects you from pregnancy right away. If the Mirena coil is inserted in the first 7 days of your menstrual cycle you are protected from pregnancy straight away. If it’s fitted at any other time, you need to use additional contraception, such as condoms, for 7 days after\n\n\nOnce in, it can be left until you wish for it to be removed or it is due to be replaced\n\n\nBoth can be used while breastfeeding\n\n\nBoth are not affected by other medicines\n\n\nThe Mirena coil is useful if you can’t use the hormone oestrogen, which is in the combined pill, the contraceptive patch and the contraceptive vaginal ring. Similarly the copper IUD does not contain hormones and can also be an option if you cannot take oestrogen or experience side effects with hormonal contraception\n\n\nBoth the IUS and IUD are two of the most effective forms of contraception available\n\n\nIt’s possible to get pregnant as soon as the IUS or IUD is removed\n\n \n \n \nSide effects of both coils\nDespite them protecting you from pregnancy, neither coil prevents you from getting sexually transmitted diseases (STIs).\nThey could affect your menstrual cycle. For the Mirena coil, many women experience spotting, lighter periods or their periods stop altogether. However for the copper coil, women can experience heavier, longer and more painful periods, though this may improve after 6 months.\nWith the Mirena coil, some women experience side effects such as acne, headaches or breast tenderness, usually in the first few months. Some women also experience changes in mood or libido. There are no hormonal side effects, such as acne or breast tenderness with the copper IUD.\nAlthough very rare, some women using the IUS can develop small fluid-filled cysts on their ovaries. These usually disappear without treatment.\nWhat do our reviews say?\nOne of the great things about The Lowdown is that real contraception users tell us their thoughts on the contraception they have tried, which we hope helps you make a better decision when you are considering going on or coming off one.\nFor the Mirena coil, almost half (45%) of reviewers said it stopped their periods completely but for the copper coil, the majority (64%) said their periods became heavier.\nOver half (58%) of reviewers said the Mirena coil either improved or did not affect their moods and 75% said the same for the copper coil.\nJust below half (44%) said the Mirena coil caused no change to their sex drive, 10% said it increased and 29% said they felt a loss in their sex drive. For the copper coil, 64% of females said there was no change in their sex drive, 16% said there was an increase and 12% said there was a drop.One of the most common side effects immediately after having the Mirena coil put in was vaginal discharge. Of the 41% reviewers who said they had vaginal discharge, almost 10% said it affected them a lot or a great deal.\nLikewise, the same side effect was reported as the most common for the copper coil right after insertion. Of the 43% who said it was a side effect, 8% said they had a great deal of vaginal discharge, 11% quite a bit and 18% a bit. (taken from data as of May 21 2024)\nMirena vs Copper coil experiences\nMirena coil\n“I have used the coil for best part of 20 years after my now 20 year old son was born. I would highly recommend, after trying the pill before this, hated that!”\n“The day I had it fitted I had THE WORST cramps I have ever had but I did also have some post smear investigations done at the same time so they probably didn’t help. I had irregular bleeding for about 6 weeks due to having my implant removed and coming off the pill at the same time as having this fitted (hormones all over the place!) 3 months ish in and it’s the best thing I ever did! No side effects, no bleeding, no remembering to take anything and covered for 8 years. Bonus I feel so much happier/positive, loss a bit of weigh (I do exercise a lot) and increased sex drive.”\n“I waited 2 years before getting the Mirena coil as I had heard so many horror stories. I saved up so I could go privately to a highly experienced gynaecologist as I was petrified about the insertion. I have had 2 babies, but I honestly did not even know she had inserted it! She gave me a numbing injection which didn’t hurt either, maybe that helped. No cramps until the evening which were quite strong, but a hot water bottle and ibuprofen helped. Some greasiness and spots in the first 3 months. However, 6 months later, no periods, no cramps, skin is back to normal, no bloating and a very reliable form of contraception. Best contraception I have used and just wish I had gone for it sooner! Advice would be, get a very experienced professional to insert, and keep with it for 6 months for your body to fully adjust.”\nCopper coil\n‘Painful insertion’\n“The insertion was very painful however I think worth it if it works for you in the long term. The positives were no change in hormones so no change in weight, mood and other changes from hormonal contraception. For me it just made my periods too uncomfortable and I also got thrush and cystitis. I’ve heard since that it is better for women who have had children so maybe that was why.”\n‘Very happy’\n“Insertion was painful and I did feel faint during the procedure but it was quick and i felt better after about 10 mins. Since then my periods have been heavier but no change in PMS, pain or cramps and more importantly to me no change to mood, skin, weight or libido like hormonal contraception can do. Very happy with the copper coil, I can tolerate slightly heavier periods and don’t have to worry about pregnancy or the hormonal side effects of other methods.”\n‘Terrible cramping’\n“The Paragard was great in some ways but it caused me terrible cramping, heavy periods (I mean like soak a super sized tampon in an hour, which normally for me wouldn’t happen even in a day), and worst of all chronic, recurrent yeast and bv infections. I have had it out for more than a year and seem to have permanently altered my vaginal Microbiome as I am still getting the occasional infection. Worst decision of my life. If you’re cool with risking long term dysbiosis, go for it, as it is a well documented side effect. Otherwise, stay away.”Still not sure which is best for you?

        "Title": "Can contraception cause yeast infections or vaginal itching?",
        "Content": "\n\nWhat are the symptoms of vaginal dryness?\nFirst things first: while it may seem like an obvious question, how do you know if you have vaginal dryness? The vagina produces normal discharge to keep itself lubricated, so symptoms to look out for include:\n\nSore or uncomfortable sex\nPain or itching in and around the vagina\nNeeding to wee more frequently\nRecurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) or cystitis\n\nWhat are the causes of vaginal dryness?\nThe first words that may spring to mind when thinking about vaginal dryness is the menopause, alongside hormones, HRT, and – the star of the show – oestrogen. Kicked off by a change in hormone levels linked to the ovaries and a reduction in the release of oestrogen, the menopause can lead to vaginal dryness.\nBut the menopause isn’t the only scenario where hormones can be sent a little wild. When it comes to discharge, hormonal contraceptives may upset the balance, and they are listed as a possible cause of vaginal dryness on the NHS website. Research into this is a little thin on the ground, but we do know about the vital role that oestrogen plays in the *ahem* smooth running of the vagina.\n\nProgestogen-only methods of contraception work to prevent pregnancy through the prevention of ovulation (when the ovaries release an egg). It is felt that this lack of ovulation and a decrease in the levels of oestrogen, may cause a reduction in blood flow to the vaginal artery. This, in turn, may result in vaginal dryness and uncomfortable sex due to the effect on vaginal lubrication. \nAccording to reviews left by users of The Lowdown, 1 in 3 experienced vaginal dryness as a result of their contraception. And the worst offenders? The vaginal ring, the combined pill, the injection, the implant, and the progestogen-only pill. Given that all these methods contain hormones, it is perhaps not surprising they are top of the list for dryness as a side effect.\nOther causes to consider include:\n\nBreastfeeding\nAntidepressant medication\n\n\nCancer treatments, for example, chemotherapy\nHaving your womb removed (hysterectomy)\n\n\nCan contraceptives help with vaginal dryness?\nWith the rise in popularity of fertility awareness methods (FAMs), you may already know that changes exist in both consistency and volume of normal discharge throughout your menstrual cycle.\nDue to variations in hormone levels, cervical mucus can take different forms depending on the day of your cycle. Oestrogen levels are particularly high around ovulation, and you may notice an increase in discharge at this time.\nThe combined contraceptive pill contains both progestogen and oestrogen, and this increased level of oestrogen in those taking the combined pill may translate to an increase in discharge. Although as we mentioned earlier users may also experience vaginal dryness!\nThe Lowdown users have reported discharge as a side effect of hormonal contraceptives, with 51% of those taking the combined pill experiencing this change, varying from “a bit” to “a great deal”.\n\nCauses of vaginal itching\nWhilst a healthy vagina shouldn’t be itchy, there can be many possible causes. Finding the culprit quickly means moving on from that niggle-some problem easily.\nCommon causes of an itchy vagina are:\n\nThrush – a common yeast infection caused by the fungus Candida. Other symptoms include a white discharge (often resembling cottage cheese), irritation around the vagina, and stinging during sex and urination.\nSTIs – including trichomoniasis, herpes, and pubic lice.\nContact dermatitis – a skin reaction with a wide range of causes, including irritating spermicides, latex, soaps, or cosmetics.\nAllergic reaction – for example, latex.\nPsoriasis – unlikely to affect the vaginal area alone, psoriasis will most probably be found on other areas of the body if found in the genital area, usually on the vulva. Your GP or dermatologist can advise on the best form of treatment, with many options available.\nLichen sclerosis – may appear on any area of the body, but most commonly found on the vulva, penis, and anus. Causing white itchy patches, lichen sclerosis is not curable, but steroid creams can help relieve symptoms.\nVaginal dryness – a possible side effect of hormonal contraception and the menopause, with symptoms of uncomfortable sex, and pain or itching around the vagina.\nAtrophic vaginitis also known as genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) – commonly experienced during and post-menopause as a result of a drop in oestrogen levels, the mucous membrane inside the vagina becomes thinner and drier, resulting in burning, itching and/or vaginal dryness\n\n\nCheck out more Trustpilot reviews here!\nCan birth control cause vaginal itching and burning?\nMaybe, but whilst some people report an itchy vagina, dryness and yeast infections as a side effect of birth control, there isn’t clear evidence to support it yet. Let’s explore further…\nOestogren and vaginal itching\nOh, hormones! From the moment you hit puberty, they just can’t help but poke their noses into different aspects of your life. And combined hormonal contraceptives like to add their two cents to the mix!\nCaused by an overgrowth of the fungus Candida, thrush is a common yeast infection that can affect anyone. Research has found that oestrogen may play a key role in the existence of thrush and therefore an itchy vagina. In fact, it may be the case that it cannot occur without it. But what this means for oestrogen in combined contraceptives and its link with thrush remains unclear.\nCan the pill make you itchy?\nEvidence for higher rates of thrush in women taking the pill is contradictory. Some research suggests switching to the contraceptive injection such as Depo-Provera, which only contains the hormone progestogen, may help those with recurrent yeast infections and vulval itching. However it is not yet clear whether other progestogen-only methods will offer the same benefits.\nOver 2 years (2019 to 2021), a quarter of The Lowdown reviewers for the combined contraceptive pill noted thrush and an itchy vag as a side effect. Similarly, 23% of those on the progestogen-only pill experienced thrush whilst using the contraceptive.\nYou can now buy the mini pill and combined pill, as well as other methods of contraception from the Lowdown. Whether you’re looking for the Hana contraceptive pill, Yasmin combined pill, or something else. Browse our contraception online.\n\nCan the morning after pill cause thrush?\nLevonelle and ellaOne are two types of emergency contraceptive pill. Whilst research suggests exposure to oestrogen may be a risk factor for thrush, the morning after pill doesn’t contain this hormone.\nHormonal changes, such as those experienced during pregnancy, may result in thrush. But as for the possibility of the morning after pill causing thrush? The evidence just isn’t there yet.\n\nCan the coil cause yeast infections?\nIUDs and vaginal itching\nThere is evidence to suggest that, yes, the copper coil may be associated with acute or recurrent thrush. Some research has found the yeast infection is able to stick to the IUD, and create what is known as a biofilm – a complex structure protecting the candida from anti-fungal treatment. But whilst the IUD may be a risk factor for thrush, there is not yet any consistent evidence linking the two. However, users who experience recurrent thrush that won’t budge with treatment may wish to discuss switching birth control.\nMirena coil and thrush\nResearch has also found an increase in Candida present in those with the IUS – the Mirena being a popular example of the hormonal coil – although this has not resulted in a significant change in symptomatic infections of users. So, whilst Candida – which causes thrush – might be more commonly found in those with an IUS (hormonal coil), it does not seem to translate to an increase in symptomatic cases of thrush. It’s therefore unclear if the Mirena Coil can cause thrush.\nAt the time of writing, 21% of copper coil users at The Lowdown report thrush as a side effects,and funnily enough, 21% of hormonal coil users reported the same!\nHowever, as always, many factors come into play. Thrush is a common yeast infection affecting 75% of women at some point in their lives, so they may have developed thrush without the coil. More research is definitely needed!\n\nWhat about the vaginal ring?\nIn a similar result to the study on coils, yeasts were found adhered to the surface of vaginal rings in a study on the vaginal health of users. However, cases of symptomatic thrush were not found to be higher in those using the contraceptive vaginal ring when compared to those using equivalent oral contraceptives.\nAs for The Lowdown users, 30% experienced thrush whilst using the vaginal ring: the highest percentage for a method of contraception reviewed by our audience, when compared to the mini pill (21%), combined pill (23%), or hormonal IUS (21%).\n\nWhat to do if your vagina is itchy\nRule number one is to consult a doctor or pharmacist. When noticing anything out of the ordinary, it is always best to seek advice from a medical professional. There are many causes of vaginal itching and so it’s key to find the right one in order to treat the problem effectively. Purchasing a vaginal health swab test kit from ScreenMe is an alternative option. Following a test, ScreenMe offers follow up 1:1 consultations to explain the results and help support you.\nSome medical conditions which can affect the vulva and vagina need to be identified, but some may be managed simply with the use of vaginal moisturisers or lubricants. For those going through the menopause, vaginal oestrogen and hormone replacement therapy may also be options. \nIf you suspect your contraception is to blame, why not book an appointment with one of our amazing doctors here at The Lowdown? They can talk through your symptoms and advise on what you should do next.\nIf you’d like to leave a review on your experiences with contraception, we’d love to hear from you!\n\n Laura Keyes is a freelance content writer living in Cornwall.

        "Title": "The combined pill &#8211; your guide to the different brands",
        "Content": "\nThe combined pill contains two hormones oestrogen and progestogen, these prevent the ovaries releasing an egg each month. The combined pill also:\n\nThickens the mucus in the neck of the womb, so it is harder for sperm to penetrate the womb and reach an egg\nThins the lining of the womb, so there is less chance of a fertilised egg implanting into the womb and being able to grow\n\nBut with over 30 brands of the combined pill to choose from, what is the difference and which is right for you?\nRead on to discover the ingredients, side effects of the pill and read real-life reviews for the most popular brands available today.\nWhat are the main differences between combined pill brands? \nYou are not alone when it comes to the confusion about differences between pills, even healthcare professionals find it challenging to understand. We have a blog about how we at The Lowdown look at different pill groups if you want more information.\nThere are two main things you can change between types of combined pill:\n\nthe oestrogen – most combined pills contain Ethinylestradiol but have varying strengths. Low dose is counted as 20mcg, normal dose is 30mcg and high dose is 35mcg. Qlaira and Zoely have a different type of oestrogen compared to the rest.\nthe progestogen. There are a range of different progestogens which may have slightly different side effects, usually we describe this in terms of some pills being more androgenic and some being anti-androgenic. To find out more about androgens check out our blog.\n\nThere are brands of combined pills which actually contain the same hormones and doses, for example the Microgynon contraceptive pill and Ovranette both contain, Ethinylestradiol (oestrogen) and Levonorgestrel (progestogen). Same hormones but different brands….. You might be aware of this as some commissioning groups in the NHS ask GPs to change people onto the cheapest brand to save cost, the theory being that it is the same hormones so there should not be a difference. Unfortunately, we do hear some people have different side effects when changing between pill brands, which contain even identical hormones and doses, although it’s difficult to say why this might be. Lloyds chemists have suggested that although the different brands have the same active ingredients, there may be differences in the other components of medication which affect absorption and release.\nFor more information, you can look at side effects for Ovranette and Microgynon here.\nAll combined pills have a slight increased risk of blood clots, some more than others. Have a look at our blog about blood clots to understand what that means to you and how changing the progestogen type in the pill can affect the risk of getting a DVT or pulmonary embolism.\nWhat does ED mean in the name?\nThe combined pill normally follows a 21/7 format: 21 days on the pill, seven day break, repeat.  You might have noticed that some pills say ED after the name, this means ‘everyday’. These contain a number of ‘dummy’ or sugar pills which mimic the break, you keep taking a tablet everyday but will have a withdrawal bleed during this time.\nWe have done a guide about taking the combined pill continuously which is a little more tricky with the ED pills as it means missing out dummy pills.\nCilest Pill\nWhat’s in Cilest?\nThe Cilest combined pill contains a higher dose of oestrogen (Ethinylestradiol) (35mcg) and a progestogen (Norgestimate). Norgestimate is classed as a less androgenic progestogen which usually means less of the unwanted side effects like oily acne-prone skin, excessive hair growth (on places such as the face and the chest) and hair loss from the head.\nSadly Cilest was discontinued in 2019. If you’re looking for an alternative, then check out the Cilique pill or Lizinna pill, which contain the same hormonal ingredients and quantities. \nCilest side effects\nThe below side effects are reported from our users\n\nTender breasts \nVaginal discharge \nEnlarged breasts \nPeriod like cramping \nThrush \n\nFemodene Pill\nWhat’s in Femodene?\nThe Femodene combined pill contains a normal dose of oestrogen (Ethinylestradiol) (30mcg) and a progestogen (Gestodene). Gestodene is classed as a less androgenic progestogen which means less of the unwanted side effects like oily acne-prone skin, excessive hair growth (on places such as the face and the chest) and hair loss from the head.\nFemodene contains the same hormones as these other brands – Femodene ED, Katya 30/75, Millinette 30/75.\nFemodene side effects\n\nThe below side effects are reported from our users\nEnlarged breasts \nTender breasts \nPeriod like cramping \nBack pain \nVaginal discharge \n\nFemodette Pill\nWhat’s in Femodette?\nThe Femodette combined pill contains a low dose of oestrogen (Ethinylestradiol) (20mcg) and a progestogen (Gestodene). Gestodene is classed as a less androgenic progestogen which means less of the unwanted side effects like oily acne-prone skin, excessive hair growth (on places such as the face and the chest) and hair loss from the head.\nFemodette contains the same hormones as these other brands – Millinette 20/75 and Sunya 20/75\nFemodette side effects\nThe below side effects are reported from our users\n\nTender breasts \nVaginal dryness \nBack pain \nEnlarged breasts \nPeriod like cramping \n\nMarvelon Pill\nWhat’s in Marvelon?\nThe Marvelon combined pill contains a normal dose of oestrogen (Ethinylestradiol) (30mcg) and a progestogen (Desogestrel). Desogestrel is classed as a less androgenic progestogen which means less of unwanted side effects like oily acne-prone skin, excessive hair growth (on places such as the face and the chest) and hair loss from the head.\nMarvelon contains the same hormones as Gedarel 30\nMarvelon side effects\nThe below side effects are reported from our users\n\nVaginal discharge \nPeriod like cramping \nEnlarged breasts \nTender breasts \nVaginal dryness \n\nMercilon Pill\nWhat’s in Mercilon?\nThe Mercilon combined pill contains a low dose of estrogen (Ethinylestradiol) (20mcg) and a progestogen (Desogestrel). Desogestrel is classed as a less androgenic progestogen which means less of the unwanted side effects like oily acne-prone skin, excessive hair growth (on places such as the face and the chest) and hair loss from the head.\nMercilon contains the same hormones as Gedarel 20 \nMercilon side effects\nThe below side effects are reported from our users\n\nTender breasts \nVaginal discharge \nVaginal dryness \nBack pain \nPeriod like cramping \n\nMicrogynon 30 Pill\nWhat’s in Microgynon?\nThe Microgynon combined pill is one of the most commonly used pills in the UK and is often a starting pill for most women. \nThis combined pill contains a normal dose of oestrogen (Ethinylestradiol) (30mcg) and a progestogen (Levonorgestrel).

        "Content": "\nThis post contains some affiliate links we earn a small commission from. We only recommend things we believe will help you, and are reviewed by our doctors ❤️\nBleeding after sex, also known as post-coital bleeding, is in most cases nothing to worry about. But in some rare cases, it may be a sign of something more serious and should be explored further by a health professional like your GP.There are quite a few reasons why you may bleed after (or during) intercourse; from lack of lubrication to having an STI. Vaginal bleeding can present as a brown or pink discharge, or light ‘spotting’ of blood – which as the name suggests, is when small spots of blood are found in your underwear or on your toilet paper.Navigating bleeding and contraception can be confusing, but it doesn’t have to be! If you‘d like to chat to one of The Lowdown’s doctors about your experience with bleeding after sex on the pill or coil, you can make an appointment here. Read on to discover the possible reasons for blood after sex and when you should seek medical advice.\nWhat are the causes of bleeding after sex and is it normal?\nSo what are the most common reasons for bleeding after or during sex? Well, there’s a few. Some are common and can be treated at home, while some may require you to visit a doctor for an examination. If you have other symptoms as well as vaginal bleeding after sex (such as pain during intercourse or in your pelvis), it’s best to get it checked out by a medical professional. \n\nHaving sex for the first time – resulting in the hymen breaking (see more below)\nChildbirth – following childbirth the vaginal tissues may be more vulnerable to injury\nMenopause – after the menopause, lower levels of oestrogen can make the vaginal walls thin, dry or inflamed\nMedications – some medications can cause vaginal dryness, including some antidepressants, allergy pills and cold/flu remedies\nChemicals – some chemicals cause vaginal dryness or irritation including laundry detergents, feminine hygiene products and swimming pool chemicals\nDouching – having sex after douching or sometimes immediately after bathing or showering can result in friction that causes the vaginal tissues to tear\nEngaging in sex before arousal – not giving your body time to naturally lubricate\nFriction during sex – increased friction and lack of lubrication may cause the vaginal tissues to tear\nSexually transmitted infections – STIs, such as chlamydia and gonorrhoea, can cause vaginal bleeding and need to be treated as soon as possible (check out our guide to STIs)\nCervical ectropion – a common cause of bleeding which can be caused by hormonal changes, pregnancy and contraception – especially the combined oral contraceptive pill. It’s caused when the cells from inside the cervix (the neck of the womb) grow on the outside surface of the cervix (the cervix sits inside at the top of the vagina). These cells bleed more easily and can cause bleeding after contact during sex. It is benign and NOT linked to cervical cancer\nPolyps – Some women may find they develop small, benign growths on their cervix called polyps, which are full of blood vessels, meaning they can bleed a lot. In some cases, your GP may send you to a specialist to assess whether they are definitely benign or need removing\nPelvic inflammatory disease (PID) – this can cause pain in the lower abdomen, vaginal discharge and irregular vaginal bleeding, alongside other symptoms. Most cases of PID are caused by an STI or bacterial infection, that has spread from the vagina or cervix to the higher reproductive organs. If you think you may have PID, you should seek urgent medical advice\nFibroids – Fibroids are non-cancerous growths that can grow on the inside of or around the womb and cause abnormal vaginal bleeding\nCervical cancer – In rare cases, bleeding after sex can be a sign of cervical cancer. Other symptoms can include pain during or after sex, vaginal discharge and pain in the pelvis or lower back. It is important to keep up to date with cervical screening tests which are offered from the age of 25 in the UK.\n\n\n \nIs it normal to bleed after having sex for the first time?\nIt is perfectly normal to experience some light vaginal bleeding after the first time you have sex, although not everyone will. Bleeding after losing your virginity could relate to a few different things, including vaginal dryness, low arousal, or the hymen breaking. The hymen is a small piece of skin that covers the entrance of the vagina. The hymen can actually break prior to losing your virginity through some overly active sports, so there may be no bleeding after sex in this case either. If you’re concerned about bleeding after the first time you have sex, speak to your GP, or make an appointment at a sexual health clinic.\nBleeding during or after sex on the pill? Here’s why…\nCertain types of contraception or birth control may cause bleeding, or brown/pink discharge at irregular times of the month, which may coincide with sexual intercourse. Many Lowdown users have reported spotting or bleeding on the pill. In particular, those who use the progestogen-only pills (mini pills) like Cerazette or Noriday.Often bleeding will settle after the first 3 months of use. If you experience persistent irregular bleeding beyond this time, a change in the pattern of bleeding, or persistent post-coital (after sex) bleeding, then speak to your doctor or healthcare professional.Another potential cause of bleeding during sex is cervical ectropion. In short, this is when the soft cells on the inside of your cervix (neck of the womb) begin to grow on the outside of the cervix. The soft cells produce more mucus and bleed easily on contact or if hit by something (yep, that includes a penis), whereas the normal outside cells offer more protection, and are less likely to bleed if knocked. The chances of developing cervical ectropion is increased for those using combined hormonal contraception, like the combined pill, as the changes in these cells are driven by oestrogen.Some Lowdown users also report vaginal dryness as a side effect of the combined and progestogen-only pills, which can in turn cause bleeding after sex due to lack of natural lubrication inside the vagina. Lube up, people! Get Yes lube from Amazon! \nBleeding after sex with a coil\nErratic bleeding or spotting after having an IUD or IUS fitted can be an initial side effect – whether immediately or the morning after. Sex should be avoided for 24 hours after coil insertion (sorry, we don’t make the rules) to help it settle in and prevent it from moving, being dislodged or bleeding.If you experience bleeding during or after sex with the IUS, like the Mirena coil, or IUD for more than three months after having it fitted, or notice a change to your bleeding pattern, speak to your GP to rule out any of the causes mentioned above.Be vigilant about any unexpected, prolonged changes to your bleeding pattern. Consider taking STI and pregnancy tests (get a pregnancy test on Amazon easily), make sure you’re up to date with your latest cervical smear, or book to see your GP or sexual health clinic for an internal examination if you’re unable to link the cause of bleeding to your IUD.\nIs bleeding after sex a sign of pregnancy?\nDuring pregnancy, your body goes through a variety of changes, particularly your cervix. You may experience a pinkish or brown discharge or some blood spotting after sex during the first few months of your pregnancy. This may happen due to the developing embryo implanting itself in the wall of your womb and bleeding may occur when your period would have been due. If you are concerned about unexpected bleeding and there’s a chance you could be pregnant, take a pregnancy test (buy here) and contact your GP.If bleeding after sex becomes more than just spotting or brown/pink discharge, or starts to become heavy with clots, or you have any additional symptoms such as tummy, pelvic, chest or shoulder pain, lightheadedness or breathlessness, you should seek urgent medical care.\nPostmenopausal and bleeding after sex: should I call a doctor?\nOestrogen is what keeps your vaginal tissues healthy, so when a woman’s oestrogen levels drop during the menopause it can cause the vaginal walls to become thin, dry and inflamed. This is known as genitourinary syndrome of the menopause (GSM) or vaginal atrophy. Therefore when a woman has sex it can often lead to bleeding. Using a lubricant will help (get water-based Yes lube from Amazon), but if the problem persists, or occurs at other times not in relation to sex, then make an appointment with your doctor. \nWhen to see a doctor for spotting or bleeding after sex?\nUltimately, the cause of post-sex bleeding can vary. Minor spotting or bleeding that goes away quickly is very common, and you may not need to see a doctor. However you should consider the need for pregnancy and STI tests to rule these out as the cause of bleeding. If you have prolonged and persistent bleeding, or bleed every time after sex, then you should contact your GP, who will examine your cervix and investigate for more serious causes.If you have a normal cervix on examination but continue to bleed after sex, or your cervix looks abnormal, then your GP may refer you to a colposcopy clinic, where you will have a more detailed examination of the cervix.It’s important to remember that if you have noticed delayed bleeding after sex, such as the day after or in the days following, this may not be related. You could be experiencing ovulation bleeding, or an irregular menstrual cycle, but it’s important to follow the guidance above, to rule out other more serious causes of bleeding.

        "Title": "Can you get pregnant on the implant? What happens if it expires?",
        "Content": "\nThe contraceptive implant is a method of contraception that stays in the upper arm for three years – perfect for those who don’t want to have to remember to take a daily pill. \nHow effective is it, and can you still get pregnant on the implant? \nIn short, the implant is more than 99% effective. This means that fewer than 1 in 100 women with the implant will get pregnant each year.\nThere are some other factors to consider when using the implant as contraception, such as side effects and its use with other medications. Navigating contraception and pregnancy – whether you’re trying to conceive or avoid it – can be a confusing journey, but it doesn’t have to be! If you‘d like to chat to one of The Lowdown’s doctors about your experience with the implant so far and what the best contraception might be for you, you can book a phone or Zoom appointment here.\nWhat is the contraceptive implant?\nThe implant, also known by the brand name Nexplanon (or previously Implanon), is a small plastic rod that is placed in the upper arm by a doctor or nurse, and is used for contraception, aka birth control.\nThe plastic device is about the size of a matchstick. The implant is a highly effective method of contraception but can have some side effects which can include changes to your periods, as well as tender breasts and mood swings for example.\nHow does the implant (Nexplanon) work to prevent pregnancy?\nThe contraceptive implant works by slowly releasing a hormone called progestogen into your bloodstream which stops you from releasing an egg each month.\nIt will also thicken the mucus in your cervix, making it much more difficult for sperm to travel through, and also thin the lining of your womb making it harder for a fertilised egg to implant. This makes the implant more than 99% effective. \nWhat does the implant do to periods?\nThe implant can have an effect on your menstrual cycle. Whilst this isn’t something to worry about, it’s definitely something to consider before opting for this form of contraception. Many women experience period changes, either becoming lighter, heavier, longer, irregular or stopping completely (also known as amenorrhoea). You may also experience spotting whilst on Nexplanon. Check out our blog about spotting whilst on contraception.\nWhen does the contraceptive implant start working to protect against pregnancy?\nThe implant can be inserted any time during your menstrual cycle. If the implant is inserted at the beginning of your menstrual cycle (the first five days) then you should be protected against pregnancy immediately.\nIf the contraceptive implant is fitted on any other day of your menstrual cycle then you will need to ensure that you use another method of contraception such as condoms for 7 days. \nWhen does the contraceptive implant start working after giving birth?\nAfter giving birth you are able to have the implant fitted any time and it is fine to use if you are breastfeeding. If fitted up to 21 days after giving birth you will be immediately protected against pregnancy.  If the implant is fitted after 21 days, you will need to ensure that you use another method of contraception such as condoms for 7 days after the implant is fitted. \nCan the contraceptive implant cause infertility?\nThe implant will not affect a woman’s fertility. As soon as the implant is removed her underlying fertility will return.\nCan you get pregnant on the implant?\nAs this method of contraception is more than 99% effective, it is very rare that you will fall pregnant on the contraceptive implant. As the implant stops ovulation this means that there is also no egg released from the ovaries to fertilise.\nCan you get pregnant on Nexplanon while on your period?\nThe same rules apply as above. Whether you are bleeding or not, the implant is still more than 99% effective. So it’s very rare you will get pregnant with Nexplanon in your arm.If you’ve just had your implant fitted and you are in the first five days of your period than you are immediately protected from pregnancy. Any later and you will need to use additional birth control for seven days.\nWhat about if I am being prescribed certain medications?\nThere are certain medications that will make the contraceptive implant less effective. This includes some HIV, epilepsy and tuberculosis medications, St John’s Wort¹ and certain antibiotics such as rifabutinor² and rifampicin³.\nWe recommend having a conversation with your doctor to ensure that any medication you are taking will not affect the effectiveness of your implant. If your medication does affect this method then we would recommend looking for another method of contraception that isn’t affected by your medication.  Unsure which method is right for you? Speak to our friendly doctors at The Lowdown and get personalised contraceptive advice in a one-to-one appointment.\nDoes taking antibiotics effect the implant’s effectiveness?\nMost antibiotics are completely safe to take with the contraceptive implant and will not affect its effectiveness. But there are certain antibiotics such as Rifabutin or Rifampicin that may make the implant less effective. Ask your GP for advice about this if you are prescribed new medicines. \nDo I need to use condoms if I have Nexplanon?\nAs Nexplanon is 99% effective, your chances of falling pregnant are very low. However you can still use condoms if you wish. We do recommend that you use condoms to protect yourself from sexually transmitted infections. Nexplanon doesn’t protect you from STDs – only barrier methods (including condoms) offer this.\nHow long does the implant last and can you get pregnant on an expired Nexplanon / Implanon?\nNexplanon can be used for three years, at which point it should be replaced to maintain its effectiveness. We recommend contacting your GP or sexual health clinic to discuss the replacement of your contraceptive implant prior to the date it is due to be replaced (so keep a diary or reminder).The implant won’t just stop working early and other than those medicines mentioned above, there isn’t anything else that makes Nexplanon less effective. There is even some evidence to say the implant remains effective (and can therefore stay in) up until four years, which was recommended during the Covid-19 pandemic when access to your GP and sexual health service was limited.  However since November 2021 the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Health in the UK have again recommended you should attend for your implant removal or replacement at three years. There are no symptoms of it ‘running out’ – any longer than three years and the implant is simply out of date and should no longer be relied on to protect you from unwanted pregnancy.\nHow will I know if I’m pregnant with the implant in my arm?\nOn the very rare chance that you may become pregnant on the implant, you may experience signs and symptoms of pregnancy:\n\nTiredness\nNausea\nHeadaches\nTender or sore breasts\nFrequent urination\n\nLooking out for a change in your period is not a good indicator of pregnancy as one of the side effects of Nexplanon is changes in the menstrual cycle. If you are concerned you may be pregnant, we recommend taking a pregnancy test before contacting your GP.  \nI want to get pregnant but I have the implant – what next?\nIf you want to get pregnant and therefore no longer need a form of birth control, you should book an appointment with your GP to remove your implant. Actively trying to get pregnant with the implant still in your arm is not recommended as this is very rare and there is also a higher risk of an ectopic pregnancy (see below).  \nWhat happens if I get pregnant on the implant?\nIn the very rare chance you become pregnant whilst using the contraceptive implant then you should contact your doctor. If you become pregnant whilst on Nexplanon, then you have a slightly higher risk of an ectopic pregnancy (outside of the womb).  If you experience unusual vaginal bleeding or lower stomach pain then you must contact your doctor immediately.  The Nexplanon implant should be removed if pregnancy occurs, but there is no evidence to suggest falling pregnant whilst using the implant poses any harm to the development of a normal pregnancy.\nWhat are the chances of pregnancy after implant removal?\nLike the combined pill and other contraceptive methods, the implant has no impact on your fertility. Once the contraceptive implant is removed, your normal level of fertility will return and you will be at risk of pregnancy. The only contraceptive that shows a link with a delayed return to fertility after use is the injection – but don’t worry, it’s only short-term. After 2 years there is no significant difference in pregnancy rates when compared with users of non-hormonal contraception. Check our our blog on contraception and the return of fertility after stopping.\nHow long after implant removal will I get my period or be able to get pregnant?\nAfter implant removal your chances of pregnancy will return to what is normal for you, taking into account any changes in medical history and an increase in age – even if you don’t have a period straight away. It can sometimes take your menstrual cycle a few months to return to normal (within 3 months for the majority of people) however ovulation may still occur (which tends to happen 2 weeks before the start of your period). So in theory, you could get pregnant after having your implant removed even if you haven’t had a period yet.If you want to get pregnant after having the implant, take a look at our guide about contraception and the return to fertility. And if you would like to learn more about the process of removing the implant, then check out our full guide on contraceptive implant fitting and removal. \nIf you’re looking for further information on this form of contraception, then our blog on ‘the contraceptive implant – everything you need to know’ covers fitting and removal plus pros and cons of this method of contraception.

        "Title": "Mirena coil and menopause: everything you need to know",
        "Content": "\n\nIt can be difficult to understand what happens when you hit menopause in any circumstances. But what about when menopause starts whilst using contraception, or with the Mirena coil (IUS) in place?Some people think the Mirena coil encourages menopause, some think it delays it and others think it masks the symptoms altogether. So what’s the truth?\nNavigating contraception and the menopause can be a confusing journey, but it doesn’t have to be! \nWhat is menopause?\nThe natural menopause is when women’s ovaries stop producing the hormones oestrogen and progesterone. Hormone levels can fluctuate for several years before (which is called the perimenopause) eventually becoming so low that the lining of the womb no longer sheds, meaning periods stop. After the menopause (which 12 months after your last period) women are no longer able to become pregnant naturally.\nThe menopause is a natural part of ageing, experienced by all women, and normally happens between the ages of 45 and 55. There can be exceptions to this and before the age of 45 is considered early menopause. When menopause occurs under the age of 40, this is known as primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). In the UK, the average age for menopause is around 51.\nCan the Mirena cause menopause?\nMany people think that interfering with hormones or being on contraception that stops your period can have an effect on when you hit menopause, but this is not true.\nEven if you are using a form of contraception that stops you ovulating, as you get older you steadily lose follicles in the ovaries (which produce eggs) and the ovaries stop producing oestrogen and progesterone. The Mirena (or any other type of contraceptive) does not have an effect on the time it takes to reach the menopause.\nDoes the Mirena coil help with menopause symptoms?\nMirena coil for heavy bleeding in menopause\nThe IUS, such as the Mirena coil, is incredibly good for treating one perimenopausal symptom in particular, heavy periods. In some cases, your monthly flow can get so heavy that you soak through a pad or tampon every couple of hours. Having a Mirena coil inserted during the perimenopause (the time from the beginning of menopausal symptoms to the after menopause) can help treat heavy menstrual bleeding. \nWhat do Mirena reviews say?\n52% of Lowdown users said the Mirena coil stopped their periods altogether, and 17% said it made them lighter (data retrieved 21.05.2024). The Mirena IUS is a recommended treatment for women who bleed heavily during their perimenopause.\nWhilst the Mirena coil may be a good treatment for symptoms like heavy bleeding, some women can experience side effects from the IUS such as acne, headaches or breast tenderness, although these tend to settle after a few months.\nDoes the Mirena coil mask menopause symptoms?\nThe Mirena coil may stop your periods altogether, but it will not mask any other symptoms of menopause. It can, however, be hard to tell whether you are perimenopausal as most women look for changes to their bleeding first and foremost. In fact, hot flushes are actually the commonest symptom of peirmenopause and the Mirena is unlikely to mask them. The Mirena coil can also cause a few symptoms that may look a lot like menopause, including mood swings and irregular periods. Using a symptom checker can help to work out whether it’s your coil or the perimenopause.32% of The Lowdown user reviews said the Mirena coil had a negative or very negative impact on their mood, whilst 43% said it had no impact (data retrieved 21.05.2024).\nWhat are the signs of menopause to look for with the Mirena?\nThe Mirena coil shouldn’t affect menopausal symptoms other than bleeding. As your oestrogen levels naturally drop, you may still experience hot flushes, night sweats and sleepless nights, amongst other symptoms. Starflower oil is a little-known natural remedy that’s great at helping to ease hormonal symptoms due to the menopause, like hot flushes. Intrigued?We’ve got you – check out our product page for more information on the benefits of starflower oil. Buy from Amazon (our affiliate link, checked by doctors!)\nHRT can help during menopause\nAlthough the Mirena coil may lighten your bleeding or make it stop altogether, it doesn’t alleviate other symptoms such as hot flushes. However Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) might.\nHRT is available in pills, patches, and gels for example and can help women with perimenopausal symptoms like:\n\nNight sweats\nVaginal dryness\nHot flushes\n\nHow to take oestrogen with the Mirena\nHRT can be given as:\n\nOestrogen only therapy for women that have had a hysterectomy (removal of the womb)\nOestrogen plus progestogen for women who have a uterus\n\nOestrogen comes in different forms including tablets, patches, gels and sprays. Tablets and patches can have  progestogens combined within them, but gels and sprays require the progestogen to be given separately. The Mirena coil can be used as the progestogen part of HRT. It’s simple to change the dose of your oestrogen part of your HRT while the Mirena is in place. You can ask for the Mirena as an option for HRT during your first menopause or HRT doctor’s appointment. \nHRT is not a method of contraception\nAlthough HRT contains oestrogen and progestogen, it does not act as a form of contraception. You should therefore make sure you are using effective contraception in addition to HRT if needed. Check out our blog on contraception in your 40s and 50s for more information about this!.\nDiagnosing menopause with the Mirena in place\nTypically you don’t need a test from the doctor to diagnose perimenopause.\nA clinical diagnosis can be made without lab tests in otherwise healthy women aged over 45 years with symptoms. Diagnosis of the perimenopause is made based on symptoms such as hot flushes and irregular periods. Menopause can be diagnosed in women who have not had a period for at least 12 months and are not using hormonal contraception, or in women who have had a hysterectomy who have symptoms – but if you have a Mirena then you may not be having periods…and you certainly haven’t had a hysterectomy!…so how to know when you have reached menopause and can remove your Mirena?\nTests to see if you’ve reached menopause with a Mirena coil\nSince the IUS can stop your periods, you may not know if you are menopausal. If this is the case and you are looking to stop using contraception, your doctor can do blood tests to check levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). FSH helps regulate your menstrual cycle and egg production.\nDuring menopause, FSH levels rise, whilst oestrogen levels drop and a blood test can reveal these changes. Your doctor may need to take a couple of tests over a period of time, as your FSH levels can rise and fall throughout your cycle. They’ll also consider other symptoms. If your FSH levels are persistently high, this indicates menopause and your Mirena can be removed if you are using it for contraception, by all means keep it in for HRT though.If you’re not sure whether the Mirena coil has made your periods stop, or whether you are menopausal, speak with your doctor or book an appointment with one of The Lowdown’s women’s health GPs for a personalised appointment to discuss your concerns.\nWhat age should the Mirena coil be removed?\nIf you want to remain protected from pregnancy, continue with the Mirena coil until you’re 55 years old. If you’re using the Mirena as part of HRT, you can continue it for as long as you need.Naturally your fertility slows down in your 40s, however it is still possible to get pregnant until the menopause. To be safe, if you have a Mirena IUS or are using another progestogen only method and are not having periods you could continue to use this method until you are 55 years old, after which point you do not need to use contraception and can safely have your coil removed. Mirena coils normally provide protection against pregnancy for up to 8 years. However if you have had your Mirena inserted after the age of 45 it can be used for contraception without being replaced until you are 55. If you’re using the Mirena as part of HRT, it needs to be replaced every 5 years.Alternatively your doctor can test your FSH levels to determine when contraception should be stopped. You could remove your Mirena coil and opt for a different method of contraception such as condoms or non-hormonal methods and if your periods return, or if they don’t return after 12 months, then you’ve hit the menopause.You will still need to use contraception until you are: \n\naged 55 or over\nor aged over 50 and it has been more than 12 months since your last period\nor aged between 45 and 50 and it has been more than 2 years since your last period\n\nCombined hormonal methods containing oestrogen and progestogen are not recommended over the age of 50 due to increased health risks in this group. \nTo summarise\nA Mirena coil doesn’t kickstart menopause or have any impact on at what age you will go through the menopause. However it can have an effect on your periods which may make identifying signs of the menopause more difficult.The Lowdown’s team of women’s health GPs are available to talk about contraception and the menopause, or any other hormonal questions you may have!\nGot more questions about menopause, HRT, or Mirena?

        "Content": "\nPeriods… most of us hate them, but when they’re late we’re consumed with worry about why they’re not there. Whilst pregnancy is usually front of mind when a period is late, there can be a number of reasons why you may have a missed period that aren’t because you’re pregnant. We’ve outlined 8 possible causes for why your period may be late despite a negative pregnancy test.Missing a period or having an irregular cycle can be confusing, but it doesn’t have to be! If you‘d like to chat to one of The Lowdown’s doctors about periods, the copper IUD or what the best contraception might be for you, you can make an appointment here.\nPossible reasons for a late or missed period\nHormonal contraception\nThe type of contraception you are using plays a factor in how your menstrual cycle operates. Birth control methods that contain hormones, in particular progestogen only, are more likely to cause irregular and late or infrequent periods. The contraceptives most likely to cause a late period are the mini pill, contraceptive implant, contraceptive injection and IUS (the hormonal coil). If you’re late or miss a period on any of these methods it’s likely it could be your contraception, but do a pregnancy test if you’re concerned.It’s also very common for hormonal coils like the Mirena coil and Kyleena coil to stop periods altogether (find out more about the types of hormonal coil). Around half of The Lowdown users say the hormonal coil stopped their period with others reporting lighter or irregular bleeds. This is more likely after a year of use. However if your periods suddenly change, check for your coil threads and do a pregnancy test.Some users also report breast tenderness, nausea and period like cramping as side effects from progestogen only contraception like the Mirena or Kyleena coil. Nausea and breast tenderness are also common pregnancy symptoms so if you experience these but have a negative test, it could be your contraception. If in doubt, see your GP.Check out our contraceptive reviews to see which methods of birth control our users have experienced late periods whilst using.Period pants are a great addition to have in your wardrobe for those moments when your period starts when you least expect it to. Modibodi and WUKA period pants are great examples of these, especially for heavy periods. \nWhat about a missed period on the copper coil (IUD)?\nThere are lots of reasons why you might have a late or missed period with the copper coil (IUD). The copper coil is hormone free so should not affect your natural cycle (although in fact it can actually make periods more heavy or painful). So in this case, other things may affect your natural cycle include stress, illness, excessive exercise, or weight change. Sometimes we never know what caused the disruption.If you have an IUD and your period is late, you can do a pregnancy test if you’re worried. In some rare cases women with copper coils can have an ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy in the fallopian tubes). If you have a positive pregnancy test with a coil in, then you need to seek urgent medical attention.\nBreastfeeding\nIf you are breastfeeding your newborn then your period may not return for many months. This happens as a result of prolactin, the hormone that causes you to make breast milk, which is the same one that stops you from ovulating and having your period. Find out more about breastfeeding as a form of contraception.\nPerimenopause\nPerimenopause¹ is the term used for the time when a woman’s body makes the natural transition to menopause (when periods stop altogether), from the beginning of menopausal symptoms to after menopause. The menopause is a natural part of ageing, experienced by all women, and normally happens between the ages of 45 and 55. There can be exceptions to this and before the age of 45 is considered early menopause. When menopause occurs under the age of 40, this is known as premature menopause.A woman’s level of oestrogen will rise and fall during this time and she may begin to have menstrual cycles where the body doesn’t release an egg. As the menopause approaches it is not uncommon to miss the occasional period and although pregnancy should be considered, it is more likely that this represents the transition into the menopause. It is normal sometimes not to get a period for two or three months, and thereafter have a heavy period, which can be difficult to manage.\nPCOS\nPolycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common condition that affects how a women’s ovaries work, affecting about 1 in every 10 women in the UK.The 3 main features of PCOS² are:\n\nIrregular periods or no periods at all  – which means your ovaries do not regularly release eggs (ovulation)\nExcess androgen – high levels of “male” hormones in your body, which may cause physical signs such as excess facial or body hair\nPolycystic ovaries – your ovaries become enlarged and contain many fluid-filled sacs (follicles) that surround the eggs\n\nOther signs and symptoms include weight gain, thinning hair and hair loss from the head, oily skin or acne and difficulty getting pregnant as a result of infrequent ovulation. Whilst the exact cause of PCOS is unknown it often runs in families and is related to abnormal hormone levels, including high levels of insulin.Myoovi is a great form of menstrual care for people who have PCOS. It works via transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) acting as a form of pain relief. \nWeight gain or weight loss\nWhilst there is no defined amount of weight that a woman can put on or lose for it to affect her period, the more significant the gain or loss in a shorter period of time the more likely her period may be late. Excessive weight loss is more likely to cause a late period than weight gain. \nStress\nIf getting your period wasn’t stressful enough, high levels of stress can actually delay your menstrual cycle. Excessive stress can affect your hormones which in turn can affect your periods. If a woman experiences severe stress they may find their periods are shorter, lighter or even non-existent. Your GP can help you explore methods that will help you manage your stress.\nExcessive exercise\nWhen you miss your period due to excessive exercise this is known as exercise-induced amenorrhea. This can be common in female athletes. Your menstrual cycle will usually return to normal once you resume a lighter exercise routine, but there can be significant risks with long term amenorrhea, including infertility and changes in bone density.\nCOVID-19?\nMany women have reported coronavirus potentially messing with their menstrual cycles. With the pandemic qualifying as a major form of stress, it’s not surprising that women are reporting irregular menstrual cycles and late periods. We spoke to reproductive immunologist Dr Vicki Male and our own Dr Fran has written about COVID-19’s impact on fertility and periods too.\nWhat to do when your period is late\nIf your period is being unpredictable and cycles are changing regularly then it is worth talking to your health care professional about hormonal issues like polycystic ovary syndrome. If your periods stop completely for more than a few months, and you are not pregnant or on hormonal contraception, then speak to your GP.There are other medical causes of missed or irregular periods we’ve not mentioned here. If your GP thinks that your lack of periods may be due to a medical cause they will investigate this, and may refer you to a specialist clinic.\nLearn more about periods\n\nMenopause Matters\nNHS UK. PCOS. 2019.\nNICE Clinical Knowledge Summaries\n\nHatty is a freelance digital marketing consultant with over 10 years experience.

One of the women, who wasn’t busy talking to a patient, raised her eyebrows at me expectantly and I approached her section with a smile plastered to my face in an attempt to improve the mood.\n“Um, I’d like a coil check please?” I enquired. “Fill this out.” She said, sliding a questionnaire through the small gap in the partition.\nI dutifully took the questionnaire away to a standing desk nearby and reported that I didn’t have symptoms of Monkeypox, as well as a few personal details. I scurried back to the counter, and was instructed to go and sit down in the waiting room round the corner, and was handed a mask to wear whilst I waited.\nThe waiting area was a clammy room, full of masked-up people who looked less than amused, and was completely silent, save for the odd grunt or cough. Occasionally, a cheerful nurse or doctor would call a name, and a relieved peer would stand and proceed to dart out of the room, not sparing a look for the poor unseen souls still sweating in the summer heat.\n***\nAfter 45 minutes of scrolling on Tiktok, and getting used to wearing a mask again, I began to wonder just how long I was going to have to wait, and thought that I should probably double check I’m booked in to be seen. \nGood vibes rating: 3/5\nDiscretion:\n“You’re waiting for a coil check darling?” The same receptionist who I had spoken to earlier confirmed, voice at a generously audible volume. “Err – yes, I am?” I confirmed quizzically. \nI prayed that I hadn’t been forgotten about and wasted 45 minutes. \nDiscretion rating: 3/5 \nWaiting time until appointment:\nMy worries were confirmed when the receptionist told me: “Oh, well, I wouldn’t bother waiting here – The lady who does those doesn’t come in until 3, maybe 4.”\nThe time was now 12:15. “Oh.” I said. “Right, well, I’m afraid I can’t wait until then – so never mind!”\nI wondered out, a little bit annoyed, and a little bit stunned. I wonder how much longer I would have waited, with the weird mobiles hanging over me, descending into madness until a member of the team came and informed me.\nAppointment availability: 5/5 \nCommunication: 0/5\nFinal comments:\nJust like the guy you had a drink with last Friday, Burrell Street has all the right intentions, but not much of the execution. If you have a free day, and a lot of patience then it’s the perfect place to wait. If you’re in need of a quick fix, or a level of communication though – I’d hunt elsewhere for your checkup.\n\nBurrell Street’s mobiles watching over me\n\nGrace is The Lowdown’s summer intern, going undercover as a secret STI shopper to bring you honest reviews of London’s biggest sexual health clinics.",

        "Title": "Does alcohol affect the pill?",
        "Content": "\nFrom a few drinks with friends at your local, to a cosy night in with your partner with a bottle of red, socialising with your loved ones can often involve a little social lubricant: alcohol. And it can be all too easy to throw caution to the wind and drink a *little* more than your next-day-hungover-self will thank you for! But if you’re taking the contraceptive pill, you may not have considered the impact of alcohol on its efficacy. Here’s what you should know.\n✅ If you think you’ll find this blog interesting, check out our newsletter for more:\n\n\nNHS advice suggests men and women should not regularly consume more than 14 units of alcohol in a week, spread out evenly over three or more days. But how many of us know how to count our units?\nIf you’re drinking spirits, it’s pretty straightforward to keep track of your alcohol consumption; a single shot (25ml, ABV 40%) is one unit, a double is two. Easy! But beer and wine are a little harder to judge, particularly with the variation in strengths. For example, a small glass of wine ABV 12% is 1.5 units, compared to the same size glass of wine at 14%, which is 1.75 units. Did anybody bring a calculator?\nThankfully, the NHS has a handy guide to calculating the units in a drink. Alternatively, Alcohol Change has an online unit calculator that does all the calculations for you!\nDrugs, booze and contraception \nEnzymes in the liver are required to process the progestogen and oestrogen hormones in both the combined and progestogen-only pills. Enzyme-inducing drugs can affect this process and impact the efficacy of oral contraceptives. Drugs used in the treatment of epilepsy, as well as some antibiotics like rifampicin and the herbal remedy St John’s Wort, can all reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives.\nConsuming alcohol does not directly affect how the contraceptive pill works. However, severe alcohol abuse over a long period of time may cause scarring of the liver, known as cirrhosis. This can lead to liver failure and be life threatening.\nUnfortunately, women suffering from severe cirrhosis of the liver also have a limited choice when it comes to contraception. They are unable to metabolise hormonal contraceptives, which results in ineffective contraception. Copper coils which don’t contain hormones can be a great alternative for women with cirrhosis.\nOn a serious note\nLong term effects of alcohol misuse include an increased risk of:\n\nliver disease\nliver cancer\nbreast cancer\nbowel cancer\nheart disease\nstroke\n\nIt’s perfectly normal to want to celebrate with a glass of wine in hand, but if you are concerned about the amount you’re drinking, reach out to your GP. You may find yourself regularly drinking more than the recommended 14 units a week or reaching for a drink first thing in the morning. Friends may be voicing their concerns, or you may yourself feel guilty about the volume of alcohol you are consuming. These are all signs you could be misusing alcohol, so don’t be afraid to ask for help.\nSo, now we’ve looked at the science behind alcohol, it’s worth thinking about the ways drinking can indirectly impact the efficacy of contraception as a whole.\nWhen the missed pill ‘hangxiety’ strikes\nAs you wake, bleary-eyed and a little worse for wear, reaching for your pill may not be at the forefront of your mind. So when the hangover has worn off, the sudden realisation of the time, and the unmistakable fact that you’ve missed your pill by more than a good few hours, can hit you like a hangover all over again. Alternatively, you may have missed taking your pill the previous evening whilst you were enjoying drinks with friends.\nMissing a pill may have implications for its efficacy, so it’s important you know what to do. At The Lowdown, we’ve got you covered. Our missed pill calculator is designed to replace the confusion of patient information leaflets and the sense of unease with a series of simple questions designed to set out your next move. Our doctors have done all the hard work for you, and it may not be the case that one missed pill equates to a sudden dash to the pharmacy (although be prepared, it might!).\nThe progestogen-only pill is a bit of a slave to routine, and for the traditional progestogen-only pills like micronor, noriday or norgeston, a pill missed by as little as 3 hours can result in a lapse in protection. Progestogen only pills containing desogestrel have a longer 12 hour window. Take the missed pill as soon as you remember and use extra contraception for the next 48 hours. Check out our diagrams on pill ‘safe windows’, to help you determine whether you’re still in the time frame of being able to take your type of pill without it counting as being missed…\n\n\t\t\t\tThe safe window for the combined pill is 24 hours\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThe safe window for desogestrel POPs is 12 hours\n\n\n\t\t\t\tThe safe window for older POPs is 3 hours\n\nAlcohol is metabolised in the liver to acetaldehyde, a compound responsible for headaches and vomiting. If you have remembered to take your pill, vomiting whilst hungover may have an impact on the absorption of your contraceptive and, subsequently, its efficacy. If this happens within 3 hours for those taking the combined pill, or within 2 hours for those taking the progestogen-only pill, take another pill right away and the next pill at the usual time. If you continue to vomit, however, you will need to think of this as a missed pill.\nConsult our missed pill calculator for more info regarding the need for emergency contraception. If you’re in any doubt, seek the advice of a medical professional.\nThe morning after pill\nLowered inhibitions as a result of alcohol may lead to more than a cheeky snog, and if contraceptives weren’t used in the way they should have been – think: badly put on condoms or forgotten diaphragms – knowing your options for how to deal with these scenarios is what The Lowdown is all about.\nIf you’re concerned about the possible lack of contraception you used the night before, emergency contraception is your friend. The morning after pill – either generic Levonorgestrel-based pills like Levonelle or ellaOne – or the IUD, known more commonly as the copper coil, are the two options available.\nLevonelle should be taken within 3 days of unprotected sex, whilst ellaOne gives you a little more time, and may be taken up to 5 days after unprotected sex. However, both morning after pills have a greater efficacy the sooner they are taken.\n\nDoes alcohol affect the morning after pill?\nLevonelle and ellaOne are not directly affected by alcohol. However there are a few important factors to remember when it comes to the morning after pill. \nOne: the morning after pill is thought to work by preventing or delaying ovulation (when an egg is released). If you are at a point in your cycle when you have already ovulated but you are at risk of pregnancy (this will be around day 14 in a typical 28-day cycle. although it varies from person to person), then the morning after pill will be ineffective.\nTwo: if you are sick within 2 hours of taking Levonelle or 3 hours of taking ellaOne, you’ll need another dose for it to work effectively. Alternatively, you may want to consider an IUD.\nBut don’t panic. The copper coil is a much more forgiving option and doesn’t care about vomiting or whether or not you’ve ovulated! It can be fitted up to 5 days after unprotected sex or up to 5 days after your earliest possible ovulation date, and is the most effective form of emergency contraception – less than 1% of women become pregnant when using the copper coil. So you may wish to consider this even if the morning after pill is a viable option. What’s more, the copper coil can remain in place for around 5 to 10 years, depending on the brand of IUD, and will continue to act as a contraceptive during this time.\n\nLet’s talk about STIs\nNow we’ve got the pregnancy scare out the way, it’s time to look at the other consequences of a contraceptive-free hook-up. Condoms provide an excellent barrier to STIs and if you find yourself worried about the potential fallout from not using them, get yourself checked. Unprotected sex, particularly with a new partner, puts you at risk of chlamydia, gonorrhoea and a whole host of other sexually transmitted delights. Read our guide to get the lowdown on all things STIs.\nIf you’re struggling with missed pills or you just feel unsatisfied with your current method of contraception, you can book an appointment with one of our amazing doctors at The Lowdown. They can talk you through all your contraceptive options and find the perfect match for you and your lifestyle. Alternatively, you can compare side effects, effectiveness and risks of all the contraceptives featured on our website with our comparison tool.\n\nLaura Keyes is a freelance content writer living in Cornwall.

        "Title": "The pill, panic attacks and anxiety",
        "Content": "\n–\n✅ If you think this blog sounds interesting, make sure to check out our newsletter for more:\n\nAlthough we know that some people experience anxiety when taking the contraceptive pill, it’s difficult to say exactly what the link is or why some users are more affected than others. In part, this is because much of the evidence is anecdotal and it’s not always easy to pinpoint why someone feels anxious. In fact, although there are plenty of studies claiming that the contraceptive pill is linked to depression, anxiety and mood changes, there are just as many which dispute this. \nSo to find out if the contraceptive pill could be the root of your anxiety, let’s take a look at what else could be triggering your symptoms.\nWhy does the pill make you feel anxious?\nFor some people, taking the contraceptive pill helps to relieve the anxiety that can come with PMS (premenstrual syndrome) or worrying about pregnancy or periods. Others find that when taking the contraceptive pill, they start experiencing anxious thoughts or physical symptoms of anxiety, such as:\n\nHeart palpitations or fast heart rate\nShortness of breath or heavy breathing\nChest pains\nSweating\nPins and needles\nTrembling or shaking\n\nBut is the pill responsible? Although we know the pill is linked to anxiety in some people, it’s difficult for researchers to understand why. There’s little definitive evidence to prove that hormonal changes on the pill are the trigger for anxiety or panic attacks. But we do know that oestrogen and progesterone have an impact on mood, and taking hormonal birth control can impact the levels of these hormones. There’s also evidence that hormonal changes – like those in pregnancy – can trigger symptoms similar to those of anxiety (like palpitations and sweating), so it’s reasonable to believe that the effects of hormonal contraception might be similar (although the hormonal changes aren’t as dramatic).\nThere’s no evidence that the pill itself causes symptoms like palpitations, breathlessness or excessive sweating, but if taking the pill makes you feel anxious, that could lead to these physical symptoms of anxiety. Some people find that palpitations, chest pain or shortness of breath in particular can make them even more anxious and lead to a panic attack.\nThere are also plenty of non-anxiety triggers for these symptoms. Frequent excessive sweating can be a result of stress, caffeine or alcohol, but also PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome) or thyroid problems. Palpitations are also commonly triggered by stress, caffeine and alcohol. Less commonly, they can be a result of heart disease or abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias). The combined contraceptive pill isn’t suitable for people with arrhythmias or heart disease so it’s important that heart conditions are identified so you can find a safe contraceptive option.\nIf your palpitations are accompanied by chest pain, shortness of breath, fainting or dizziness, call 999 or go to your local A&E department as these could be signs of something more serious. As with anything, if your symptoms aren’t getting better with lifestyle changes, are worrying you or are affecting your daily life, speak to your GP.\nIs it really the pill?\nSometimes it’s the act of taking medication, rather than the medication itself which can trigger anxiety. Even though – with perfect usage – the contraceptive pill is 99% effective at preventing pregnancy, unplanned pregnancy is still a worry for many people using contraception. You might also be worried about whether you’re taking it correctly, whether you’ve missed a dose or if you’ll run out before you can get another prescription. Luckily we’ve got you covered. Check out our missed pill calculator for when you think you may have missed a pill and our subscriptions service where we keep on top of your prescriptions so you don’t have to!\n\nWhen taking any new medication it’s not unusual to worry how it might make you feel. Given the countless scare stories and misinformation about the contraceptive pill, it’s unsurprising that people experience health anxiety about side effects or very rare complications like blood clots. If you’ve had a bad experience with contraception in the past, you might also be wondering if something similar will happen again. Check out our contraception reviews to see what other people have to say about different methods.\nIn general both the combined pill and progestogen only pill are safe and effective methods of birth control, and according to the UN the pill is the contraception of choice for 151 million women worldwide. If you think your anxieties are a result of worrying about your medication (rather than a side effect of your medication), it’s worth speaking to your local pharmacist, GP or one of our women’s health doctors for reassurance.\nFinding the right support\nIf you’re struggling with anxiety, seeking the right support is essential to managing your symptoms. But, like contraception, what works for one person might not work for you so it’s a good idea to explore all of the options available to you.\nIf you think your contraceptive pill might be impacting your mental health, ask yourself:\n\nWhen did the anxiety begin? When did I start taking my new medication?\nIs there anything stressful happening in my life which could be making me feel anxious?\nDo I have concerns about the pill which are worrying me?\nHave I experienced similar symptoms before?\nAre there any physical symptoms?\nWhat makes the anxiety better or worse?\n\nIf your anxiety isn’t getting better, affects your daily life or seems to be triggered by medication, speak to your GP. If they think there’s a link, they may consider offering you an alternative contraceptive pill or a different method of contraception. They may also suggest exploring mental health treatment options like medication or cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Many people living with anxiety find that talking therapy helps to ease their symptoms. You can refer yourself for NHS talking therapy using the NHS IAPT service, or seek out private therapy with a registered therapist or counsellor. There are also plenty of helpful tools online to help you manage your anxiety, including meditation apps like Headspace or Calm, Your Mind Plan from NHS Every Mind Matters and self-care and treatment advice from Mind.\n\nMilly Evans is a freelance journalist, content creator and sex educator with a special interest in sexual and reproductive health, inequality and LGBTQ+ and neurodivergent health.

Let’s explore why this can happen, what effects it can have on your relationship, and most importantly, some actions you can take to get your sex drive back.\nWhy do I have no sex drive?\nThe reasons for you having no sex drive or losing your libido are varied, here’s the lowdown on some possible causes…\n\nMedications: SSRI antidepressants, antispsychotics, antihistamines, heart medication, and some forms of hormonal contraception have been shown to impact your libido. In my experience working with female clients, many of them have reported an abrupt change in their libido and orgasmic response when they started taking antidepressant or antipsychotic medication, even though it was very needed. \nHormonal changes: The menopause, your menstrual cycle, conditions like PCOS and PMDD, to going through gender affirming treatment where you are taking Hormone Replacement Therapy. \nStress and burnout: Whether it’s your job or business, income, moving house, family, illness, bereavement where you live, or just low level, ongoing chronic stress\nVulvar or vaginal pain: Whether it’s a yeast infection, vaginismus, vaginitis, vulvodynia, dyspareunia (painful sex), or an undiagnosed pain where doctors cannot find a cause; if penetration is hurting you, then it’s pretty inevitable that you will lose your desire for sex too\nChronic pain or long term health conditions: Because if you are trying to navigate constant pain, fatigue, dizziness, and a myriad of other symptoms, this can really impact your libido\nYour body has changed: Maybe you’ve gained or lost a lot of weight, you’ve had surgery, an injury, given birth, or you’re going through the menopause and your body isn’t what it used to be \nMental health and trauma: Depression, anxiety, OCD, or past trauma you haven’t fully processed yet \nPregnancy, birth, and postpartum: From all the hormonal changes and changes to your body, to tearing during childbirth, not fully recovering afterwards, and general fatigue from taking care of an infant\nSexual boredom and not having your needs met: If it’s been the same old thing for years, what your partner is doing just isn’t working, or not feeling turned on by what you are doing\nCommunication issues and conflict with your partner: Repeated arguments, not being able to forgive a past betrayal, to just struggling to get on the same page with each other \nLack of sexual chemistry with your partner: Maybe you are both lacking in sexual skills, or you don’t feel attracted to them anymore\nYou’re on the asexuality spectrum: Sexual desire is a spectrum just as much as sexual orientation and gender identity. You may be asexual or demisexual.\n\nAs you can see from this extensive list, some causes are physiological, some are mental and emotional, some are lack of awareness, and some are caused by your relationship. Usually it’s a combination of various factors.. \nYour libido can be affected by so many things, especially in women or folk who are AFAB. \nThink of your libido or your sex drive like the canary in the coalmine, where it’s telling you that something needs addressing in your life.\nRemember that your libido is something that naturally fluctuates over the course of your life, it’s not fixed. It changes not just in your desire for sex, but often what kind of sex you desire, how it feels in your body, and what you like.\nSome people also find that their contraception affects their sex drive. If you want to discuss changing your contraception and the possible side effects, you can speak to one of our women’s health GPs to discuss your options.\n\nThe effects of the lack of physical intimacy on your relationship\nLack of physical intimacy has a knock on effect on your whole relationship that is far bigger than how often you have sex.\nFor you, you may be feeling frustrated at yourself, embarrassed or even ashamed that there is something “wrong” with you because you can’t satisfy your partner (there isn’t, by the way). You can end up feeling like the gatekeeper of your relationship, where you are constantly refusing and pushing your partner away, and then you feel resentful, frustrated, and sad because of that. You may find yourself unconsciously trying to avoid your partner– by burying yourself in work, kids or hobbies, deliberately going to bed earlier, or just pulling away from them when they try to kiss you.\nYou can also lose your sexual confidence. This is what Jennie* said:\n“I became a mother in November last year, and it was like my sex drive evaporated. I’ve found it so difficult, as I have previously very much embraced my sexuality, and the pleasure I derived from sex. Between postpartum hormones and the contraceptives I’m taking, I feel like I’ve been robbed of my spark. Motherhood is beautiful, and has given me a new light in my life, but I hope my sex drive returns sometime.”\nFor your partner they can also feel very frustrated too. They may feel like they are being constantly rejected, like there is something wrong with them for wanting to enjoy sex with you, or like they are doing something wrong. They may worry that you don’t find them attractive anymore, or if you still love them, and then feel incredibly lonely. This then can turn into feeling resentful and angry, which then spills out into the rest of your relationship like arguing more or avoiding time with each other. This is why it is so important to address the elephant in the bedroom as soon as you can.\nHow to stop the lack of sex drive from ruining your relationship\nRemember that all couples will experience mismatched libidos during the course of their relationship or marriage at some point. There will be times where one of you has a higher libido than the other, where your preferences will change, and your body will change, this is all normal! Here are some practical tips to try:\nCommunicate!\nIt is vitally important that you communicate what is going on for you with your partner, especially on how it feels for you and how you feel about them, so they can understand and not feel alone. If this feels anxiety provoking, it may help to journal on how you feel and/or talk about it first with somebody you trust who is more neutral.\nFind out what your sexual accelerators and brakes are\nIn the book, “Come As You Are”, by Emily Nagoski, she explains how we all have unique sexual “accelerators”— ie what makes us excited and horny, and sexual, “brakes”— ie what shuts down sexual desire. It’s also known as, “turning off the offs and turning on the ons”. (If you want to nerd out on sexual science, this comes from research at The Kinsey Institute on the Dual Control Model of Sexual Response.) Think about what you need to feel your most horny and receptive, and what gets in the way, and then you can much easier ask for what you need. You could also explore what your Erotic Blueprint is— which was a system designed by sex educator, Jaiya — whereby we all have different erotic personality types. \nTackle your stress\nThis could look like getting into a mindfulness practice, regular yoga, getting out in sunlight every day, or doing things to complete the stress cycle such as boxing, running, punching pillows, or singing. Mindfulness practices are documented to be incredibly beneficial for sexual concerns, including with vulvar pain, past traumatic experiences, and general sexual anxiety. Also think about what practical things you need to change in your life– such as delegating, asking for help, setting boundaries, getting support with childcare, or a career change. What you do doesn’t matter as much as making it a priority and being intentional about it. \nTake sex off the menu for now\nWhat if you could play with the idea of taking sex— i.e intercourse and penetration— completely off of the menu, and instead explore all the other avenues of being intimate with each other? You could journal on it, on what you would love to explore, and talk about it with your partner. \nNon-sexual touching\nExplore all the non-sexual ways you can touch, like holding hands when you’re out, cuddling on the sofa, massages, foot rubs, or even kissing. You may want to explore sensate focus as an option to get back to touching each other without the expectation of it leading to intercourse.\nMake intimacy a priority\nActually schedule intimacy into your calendar and make it just as much a priority as all your other appointments to remind yourself how important it is. You don’t have to schedule in sex, but you could schedule in a proper date night, time to massage each other, or exploration time. Or you could schedule in a couples’ workshop or retreat, time to read books or watch series on sexuality.\nMove your body\nDid you know fitness and exercise are great for your libido? You don’t need to punish yourself doing crossfit— in fact too much high intensity exercise can have the opposite effect— just find a form of joyful movement that feels good to you and helps you feel alive. Dancing is one of the best forms of movement for libido, especially if it’s working with erotic and sensual movement. In my own client work, I use a combination of both talk-only approaches and mindful movement practices. I have found that they usually enjoy the movement practices and find them much more beneficial than just talking alone. I liken it to seeing the lights come on in their eyes again, and it’s very powerful to witness. It doesn’t matter what kind of dancing you do, whether it’s salsa or bachata, bellydance, burlesque pole fitness, or just putting on some music and dancing in the kitchen.\nSelf-pleasuring and masturbation\nMany research studies suggest that regular masturbation actually helps increase your desire for partner sex, rather than the opposite. Think of it as feeding your own erotic fire, and tending to your own sexual needs just as much as you would your partner’s. You can also schedule this into your calendar, where you make solo sexy exploration a priority. Use all your toys or just your hands and imagination, and add in some pelvic rocking and breath. Check out the platform OMGYES.com to learn practical self-pleasuring techniques. \nRekindle your creativity\nIn tantra, they say that your sexual energy is also your creative energy, so now is the time to get back into your passions. Whether it’s getting back into your art, dancing, writing, or anything else (you could even start writing your own erotic fiction and fantasies), let’s re-awaken your passions again. \nGet help with your low libido \nIf you’re looking for practical support to help with your low libido, then working with a sex coach can help you. A sex coach is somebody who is specifically trained to help people with their sexual problems, to provide accurate and pleasure-focused education and then actionable tools to start doing. Sex coaches work in a holistic way, where we work with all of you and affirm your sexuality as something positive and important. We are sex-positive, empowering, and affirmative of your sexuality and sexual expression, and stand for your pleasure. \nWhen you work with a sex coach, you get a mix of bespoke sexuality education, exercises tailored to your unique needs, and a sex-positive ally to support your sexual goals.\nSex coaches can help with issues like:\n\nOrgasm difficulties\nLow libido\nBody image issues\nVulvar and vaginal pain\nSexual communication\nExploring fantasies\n\nYou can either book a one-off 30 minute introductory consultation, or a full 45 minute session with The Lowdown’s resident sex coach (me!) to discuss your needs and concerns. During your session, I will provide an affirming and listening ear, and then offer you some simple and practical suggestions to try. You can also explore working with me for a longer period of time if this is what you need. I am totally sex-positive, LGBTQIA+ affirming, and kink-friendly too!\n\nLucy is a certified sexologist and sex coach who is passionate about helping women and people with vulvas let go of sexual shame and hangups. She uses a combination of mind-body tools with evidence-based sexuality education. Her speciality is working with people who come from faith backgrounds who are struggling to let go of sexual shame and enjoy pleasurable relationships again.\n",

        "Title": "Is sex uncomfortable but not painful? Here&#8217;s 8 possible reasons why&#8230;",
        "Content": "\nUncomfortable sex can be, well – a pain. And despite being pretty common, it’s still one of the most neglected issues in women’s health. Discomfort can make it really difficult to engage in or enjoy sexual intercourse, and because of how taboo conversations around sex can still be, it can be an isolating experience if you don’t feel able to talk about it. This can have an effect on not only your mental, physical and emotional wellbeing, but also on your relationships and body confidence.  \nWe’ve got the lowdown on common causes of sex-related discomfort down under, plus the facts to give you clarity, confidence and put you back in control.\n –\nWhy might sex be uncomfortable?\nThe medical term for painful sex is dyspareunia. One way of classifying it is according to when you first experienced it. Primary dyspareunia refers to pain from when you first started having sex while secondary is developed later. An awareness of which of the two fits for you is helpful for your healthcare professional to know. This, and knowing where it feels sore. \nIn other words: Is it the V or the P?\nV is for VAGINA\n\nYour vagina is the connecting tube between your vulva and your cervix. Think of it as the connection between the outside and your body’s inner core. If the pain you experience during sex feels pretty superficial, around the vulva or the entrance to the vagina, it could be due to any of the following:\nVaginal dryness\nA common culprit, vaginal dryness can create friction during intercourse and make it a rather uncomfortable experience. When aroused, fluid is released through the walls of the vagina to prepare for penetration. Sometimes, this fluid might not be enough. People who are breastfeeding, going through menopause or who are on certain medications such as antidepressants or contraceptive pills may experience this.\nLubricants are a great way to remedy this. In some cases, vaginal oestrogen can also help, such as when you experience vaginal dryness due to menopause.\nVaginismus\nVaginismus is an automatic bodily reaction to the fear of any type of penetration of the vagina. As a result, when penetration is attempted the vaginal muscles tighten up involuntarily. This spasm can make sex difficult. Most people find that they have it when they try to insert tampons or the first time they try and have sex. Treatment usually focuses on exploring your feelings towards penetrative sex and may also involve exercises to get you feeling more comfortable about it. At The Lowdown, we offer one-to-one online sessions with both a sex coach and a pelvic health physiotherapist. They can provide advice on the mental aspect of vaginismus and penetration, or physical exercises to help you strengthen and better control your vaginal muscles.\nInfections, Inflammation or Irritation\nThrush, bacteria, viruses or sexually transmitted infections (STIs) may cause vaginal soreness. These infections will typically feature itching or burning and/or discharge that is different from your normal. If this is the case, treating the infection will usually fix the problem.\nYour vulva or vagina may also become irritated after using body products you may be allergic or sensitive to, such as douches, perfumed soaps or lubricants. It can also occur if you have something stuck up there e.g. a tampon (yes, this happens!).\nInjury\nTears to genital tissue can happen during labour and childbirth. If ignored, these may cause discomfort during sex, sometimes for extended periods of time. Splitting of the skin around the entrance to the vagina can also happen when the skin is stretched during sex and can be a cause of recurrent pain. \nP is for Pelvis\n\nIf your discomfort feels deeper, the issue could be higher up.\nYour pelvis is the lower part of the trunk of your body and contains a whole array of organs plus your bladder and rectum (part of your bowel). In women, these other organs will typically consist of the cervix (aka the ‘neck of the womb’), uterus (womb) which is lined with endometrium (womb lining), fallopian tubes (connecting the ovaries to the womb) and ovaries.\nProblems with the cervix\nDuring vagina-penis intercourse, the penis can meet the cervix at maximum penetration and/or in certain positions. Sometimes, this deep penetration can cause discomfort – it’s even got its own name: collisional dyspareunia.\nProblems with the uterus or ovaries\nSex can be uncomfortable if you have a disorder of these areas, such as fibroids or cysts.\nFibroids\nFibroids are non-cancerous growths made up of muscle and tissue. They can develop in or around the womb and tend to vary in size. Around 1 in 3 women with fibroids will experience symptoms, such as heavy periods, lower back pain and – you guessed it – painful sex.\nOvarian Cysts\nOvarian cysts are tiny sacs of fluid that can develop on an ovary (the part of the female reproductive system that produces and stores eggs). These cysts are common and usually go away themselves, unless they grow too large or split. When this happens, possible symptoms include painful sex, pain in the pelvic area and bloating.\nPelvic inflammatory disease\nPelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of the female reproductive system which includes the womb, fallopian tubes and ovaries. You are at higher risk of PID if you have an STI that is left untreated.\nRetroverted or ‘tilted’ uterus\nNearly 1 in 5  women will experience discomfort because they have a retroverted uterus, where the uterus tilts backwards towards the rectum instead of forwards towards the belly. This does not usually affect your fertility, but it can make certain sex positions uncomfortable.\nDid you know: Smear tests are a straightforward and necessary part of screening for abnormal cells on your cervix that could develop into cervical cancer if left untreated. In the UK, if you’re a woman or assigned female at brith, you are invited for screening from age 25 and every 3 to 5 years depending on where you live.\nProblems with the lining of the uterus (endometrium)\nEndometriosis is a common disorder affecting as many as 1.5 million people per year in the U.K. It is a condition where the womb lining grows in other parts of the body such as on the bowels or bladder. It can be a really difficult condition to live with because it can be hard to diagnose and complex to treat. We’re really passionate about spreading endometriosis awareness here at The Lowdown, as our Founder Alice suffered with it for years. Check out our webinar on endometriosis with leading expert Professor Andrew Horne for more information on signs, symptoms and treatment, as well as our blog on the best contraception options to help manage endometriosis.\nAnother condition is adenomyosis, where the endometrium grows deep into the muscular wall of the womb. This can lead to thickening of the womb lining, heavy bleeding, and painful sex. \nA UTI\nA urinary tract infection (aka UTI) can occur in any part of your urinary tract i.e. your bladder, ureters (the tubes between your bladder and kidneys) and kidney. Bladder infections, in particular, may make sex incredibly uncomfortable. Classic symptoms include pain or burning when you pee and/or peeing more often. If you experience recurring UTIs often, this can be especially difficult to deal with, but treatment options are available. Our community also recommends D-mannose to help prevent UTIs from happening in the first place!\n\nWhat can I do if sex feels uncomfortable? \nIf you experience recurrent pain during sex, whether in your vagina or deeper in your pelvis, it is super important to see your doctor. Potential things your doctor might do after finding out more about your challenges include: examining you, looking at your cervix, swab tests, arranging scans, blood or urine tests, treating infections, reviewing any medications you are taking that might be causing your symptoms, referrals to a gynaecologist and more.\nUntil then, there are a variety of things you could try to make your experience of sex more pleasurable (as it should be!):\nGet screened for STIs\nSTIs can be tricky stuff if left undiagnosed or undertreated. If you are sexually active, taking care of your sexual health is an important part of staying healthy and enjoying sex. Regular STI checks are widely available at sexual health clinics across the U.K.\nNot sure where to go? We’ve got you. To find your nearest one, head to our sexual health clinic finder. Sexual health has never been easier to take care of!\nLube up\nIf sex is painful for you and you think it might be because of vaginal dryness, incorporating lubricants into your sex life could be worth a try. In some cases such as vaginal dryness due to menopause, vaginal oestrogen can also help. Get Yes lube from Amazon (this is an affiliate link but we love this stuff).\nChange position\nEver heard Aaliyah’s hit song “Rock the Boat”? No? Have a listen! If you’re having trouble enjoying sex because it hurts, try changing position. \n\nOur amazing resident pelvic physiotherapist has a wealth of knowledge on all things related to your pelvic floor and managing some causes of painful sex (including endometriosis). You can book a consultation in a few clicks, or find out more about your pelvic floor by watching our pelvic health webinar.\n(And the Aaliyah reference will make sense after you hear the song, we promise).\nBe kind to yourself\nBeyond the physical causes listed above, anything from previous traumatic experiences or negative personal, cultural or religious beliefs about intercourse can make it an uncomfortable experience. Your emotional wellbeing matters. Be open with your partner about your discomfort and how you feel. It’s also important to look at your body and learn what feels good for you. \nSpeaking with a sex and intimacy coach can be a great step. Book a consultation with our resident sex coach to talk about it in a non-judgmental, safe space that puts you first.\nIn summary, there is no shame in acknowledging sex is uncomfortable or painful for you. If you do experience this, it’s a good idea to have a chat with a healthcare professional.

        "Title": "What are the causes of bacterial vaginosis?",
        "Content": "\n✔️If you think this blog sound informative, make sure to check out our newsletter for more:\n\nWhat is bacterial vaginosis?\nBacterial vaginosis, or BV, is caused by a change in the natural balance of bacteria found in the vagina. Why this happens, we’re not too sure. But there are things that can increase the chances of BV. Firstly though, let’s get one thing straight: BV is NOT an STI.\nWhat are the symptoms of bacterial vaginosis?\nBV is really common, but only 50% of people with BV will show symptoms. These can include:\n\nWatery, thin discharge that is white, grey or green in colour\nA fishy smell that can become stronger after sex\n\nThere’s something fishy going on here\nBV comes with a defining characteristic: a fishy smell. For some, it may be so bad that it is noticeable even through clothing. It can also be made worse by sex and your period. It all comes down to the vagina’s pH – how acid or alkali the vaginal environment is. The vagina should be naturally acidic, meaning it has a LOW pH. If the pH rises aka, the vagina becomes more alkaline, this can be a trigger for BV and that fishy smell. As sperm and blood are both alkaline, they increase the pH in the vagina, thereby sometimes increasing the smell.\nWhat are the causes of bacterial vaginosis?\nThe vagina is a sensitive thing: the goldilocks of the body, if you will. The vagina likes the pH not too high, but not too low – it should be just right. If something upsets the balance of the pH – it can lead to bacterial vaginosis. The vagina is naturally home to bacteria, both the good and the bad. The most common of the ‘good’ bacteria is known as lactobacilli, which keeps your vagina acidic. These bacteria coexist in a happy balance, but when the bad ones increase in numbers, so too does the pH, making the environment more alkaline. This change in normal vaginal flora is the cause of bacterial vaginosis and its symptoms.\nNow, there’s not one type of bacteria that causes BV; it’s more of a change in numbers of the bacteria that are already there – or the introduction of new ones from other parts of the body, be that yours or someone else’s. This is why BV is not a sexually transmitted infection, as it’s not a single bacteria that causes the infection. It’s simply a change and potential upset of the natural balance of the vagina. There are also a number of things that are thought to increase your chances of getting bacterial vaginosis…\nHaving sex\nBeing sexually active with new or multiple partners can increase your risk of getting BV due to the introduction of different bacteria from your sexual partner(s). The presence of an IUD (intrauterine device), or copper coil, could also mean your risk of getting BV is higher.\nIt’s possible to pass on BV from one vagina to another during sex, so if you think you have BV and have a sexual partner(s) who also has a vagina, make sure you communicate this with them as they may also need treatment. Receiving oral sex can also put you at greater risk of bacterial vaginosis.\nNot using a condom\nNow, we mentioned earlier that BV is NOT a sexually transmitted infection. And while that’s true, sex can increase your risk of developing BV. So too can sex without a condom. This comes back to the pH levels of your vagina and your partner’s sperm. Your vagina is kept at its healthy, slightly acidic pH by the healthy bacteria within it. Sperm, on the other hand, is alkaline. So when the two meet – as they do during unprotected sex – the vaginal pH can rise. And this can increase your risk of BV. Having BV can also increase your chances of catching an STI. So use those condoms, people!\nScented products and vaginal douching\nThe vagina is self-cleaning and only needs to be washed with warm water externally around the vulva. Anything more than that has the potential to irritate the vagina. Vaginal douching and other vaginal ‘hygiene’ products are not recommended by medical professionals. Products like bubble bath, scented shower gels and soaps, as well as strongly perfumed washing detergents can all disrupt the delicate balance of natural vaginal flora leading to BV.\nSmoking\nYou’re probably thinking, ‘what does smoking have to do with my vagina?’. It’s recommended you steer clear of smoking in general to maintain good overall health, but a little known fact is that smoking actually encourages the production of the bad bacteria that causes bacterial vaginosis and that distinctive fishy smell. Smoking also stops vaginal tissue from responding to oestrogen. You’ve most likely heard of oestrogen, but did you know that it helps to maintain strong and healthy vaginal tissue?\n\nWhat is the treatment for bacterial vaginosis?\nOften, bacterial vaginosis will clear up on its own, but if you want to get rid of that fishy smell ASAP, or find it’s just not going away, there are treatments available. Treatment for bacterial vaginosis comes in the form of tablets, creams or gels.\nLactic acid gel\nUsing lactic acid gel creates an acidic environment in the vagina, encouraging the growth of the naturally occurring lactobacilli and can clear up BV in a few days. The gel also contains glycogen, which provides nutrients to these bacteria to help them grow. It is a great option for those looking to avoid antibiotics, as the gel is able to work locally. Relactagel – the BV gel treatment you’ll be able to purchase from a pharmacy – can be used for both the treatment and prevention of bacterial vaginosis.\nAntibiotics\nAntibiotic tablets have a high success rate in the treatment of BV, but 15-30% of women will experience a recurrence within 3 months of antibiotic treatment. And of those already experiencing recurrences, the initial success rate seems to be lower. Antibiotics also disrupt the good bacteria in the vagina and so can lead to recurring BV or even thrush. You may find a combined approach works best for you; using over the counter lactic acid gels to maintain the normal pH level and encourage the good lactobacilli, and prescription antibiotics on top of this if needed.\nWhen to see a doctor\nIf you’re pregnant and you suspect you have BV, speak to a healthcare professional, like your GP or midwife. Bacterial vaginosis can increase your risk of complications during pregnancy, including premature birth and miscarriage. For this reason, they will usually recommend treatment in pregnancy. But for most, BV will cause no issues at all.\nIf you find that you have recurring bouts of BV, discuss with a healthcare professional the option of longer treatment to avoid it returning in the future.\nOur speak to a doctor service is a convenient way to talk to a women’s health GP at a time that suits you. Our medical team are available to talk about treatment options and can help you identify a possible trigger for your BV.\nWe musn’t overlook the psychological impact of recurrent bacterial vaginosis. The symptoms can be distressing and embarrassing, and may be misunderstood. Recurrence rates show that of the women who were successfully treated for BV, 52% had at least one further occurrence. If bacterial vaginosis recurs, it may be necessary to restart treatment and continue for a longer period of time –  up to six months if needed – to avoid a recurrence of BV. You can discuss this with your healthcare professional or local sexual health clinic, who can advise how long treatment is necessary.\nLaura Keyes is a freelance content writer living in Cornwall.

        "Title": "The lowdown on menopause and anxiety",
        "Content": "\nIf you’re experiencing anxiety whilst going through the menopause, you’re not alone. We look at the link between the menopause and anxiety, and the treatment options available to you.\n✅ If you think you’ll find this blog helpful, check out our newsletter for more!\n\nWhen you consider the menopause is something over half the world’s population will go through, it’s astounding to think we are prepped with so little information. And when there are so many symptoms that can impact every aspect of life, it’s time to get the facts straight. Check out our blog on menopause and contraception for more information, specifically how this can affect your contraception.\nThe menopause typically occurs between the ages of 45 and 55, although it can start earlier.  And perimenopause – which includes the time before your periods stop as menopausal symptoms start, and the twelve months after your periods have stopped – can last for months, or even years. \nIs there a link between menopause and anxiety?\nThe menopause can cause a whole host of symptoms, including both physical and mental. The most commonly known physical symptom is perhaps hot flushes, with 79% of women surveyed by the British Menopause Society experiencing hot flushes as a symptom of the menopause. 70% suffered from night sweats and 50% noted an impact on their sex lives.\n\nSymptoms of menopause anxiety\nCan the menopause cause anxiety? Yes – and it’s not the only mental health symptom. Symptoms of menopause anxiety include:\n\nlow mood\nbrain fog (problems concentrating and difficulty with memory)\nlow self-esteem\nlack of confidence\n\n20% of women surveyed had difficulty with their memory and concentration, and 36% of said the menopause had an impact on their social life.\nSo whilst this all might sound a little unnerving, there are treatments available.\nWhat are the treatment options for menopause anxiety relief?\nLifestyle changes\nEating well and exercising regularly are easy changes that can have a positive impact as you go through the menopause. A healthy diet rich in calcium will help support bone health, and cutting down on tea, coffee and alcohol may reduce the triggers of hot flushes. Keeping to a regular sleep schedule to help stay well rested, and introducing yoga or mindfulness may help in calming down anxious thoughts. It is also recommended to not smoke and to limit your alcohol intake to 14 units a week.\nAnxiety around physical symptoms of the menopause can have a knock-on effect on self confidence and self esteem. Tackling the physical symptoms of the menopause can help boost confidence and overall wellbeing.\nSupport can also come through nutritional supplements. By taking supplements, such as Wellwoman or Wild Nutrition, you will not only be provided with lots of nutrients but also migraine and stress relief. Wellwoman also includes starflower oil…\nStarflower oil\nStarflower oil is high in gamma-linoleic acid – or GLA – an omega-6 fatty acid that helps to reduce inflammation. GLA is used in the treatment of nerve pain, joint aches and skin conditions. It has also been found to help in the management of breast pain, which women often experience as a symptom of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). There isn’t currently enough evidence to confirm that starflower oil helps with other symptoms of PMS, but anecdotally, loads of our community tell us that it’s helped them manage PMS aches, pains and cramps.\nAs with starflower oil, evening primrose oil also contains gamma linoleic acid (GLA). It is rich in omega-6 and has shown positive effects in cyclical breast pain, rheumatoid arthritis, and dermatitis. Starflower oil generally contains a much higher concentration of GLA than evening primrose oil (just over double the amount!), which is why we think it can be more effective at managing these symptoms.\nMore research is also needed to confirm, but there is some evidence that GLA may help with psychological symptoms of menopause. A ‘prominent alleviation’ of symptoms was shown in participants of a 2020 clinical trial. GLA may also help ease physical symptoms of the menopause such as hot flushes, leading to improved sense of wellbeing and quality of life.\nIt also comes with few side effects and is a great option for those looking to avoid hormonal treatments – you can grab starflower oil from The Lowdown in our new shop! There are some drug interactions to note, so chat to your GP or pharmacist beforehand if you’re currently on other medication.\n\nTherapy\nCognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can be a great option to run alongside other treatments or as an alternative to medication. CBT is a talking therapy that you can often self-refer to through the NHS without the need to see your doctor. It can help with feelings of anxiety and low mood by breaking negative thought patterns and looking for practical solutions you can implement in your everyday life.\nTalking therapy or counselling can help you tackle specific negative thought patterns and help you overcome unhelpful ways of thinking. But in addition to this, a natter with like-minded individuals going through the same thing you are can work wonders for your mental health. Knowing you’re not going through things alone and laughing over shared experiences can be an invaluable help.\nHormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)\nDuring the menopause, levels of oestrogen drop and bring about both physical and psychological symptoms. Oestrogen can be replaced with hormone replacement therapy (HRT). For anyone with a womb, HRT should contain both oestrogen and progestogen, as oestrogen alone can cause the womb lining to grow.\nHRT can take many forms, including tablets, patches, implants, gels and sprays which will need to be prescribed by your doctor. There is also the Mirena, a progestogen releasing coil, so there are many options to choose from. Anyone without a womb, or those who have the hormonal Mirena coil, can just use an oestrogen replacement. \nHRT can come with its own side effects which can include fluid retention, breast tenderness, bloating, headaches and mood swings. However, these often improve with time, and so it is advised to continue with treatment for three months before seeing your GP. HRT also comes with small risks but for most people, the benefits of HRT usually outweigh the risks and your doctor should be able to discuss these with you.\n\nComplementary therapies\nFor many people going through the menopause, HRT can be a life changing solution. But according to Women’s Health Concern, a survey found that 95% of women said ‘they would try alternative therapies before HRT because they think they are more natural and because they are worried about the health risks of HRT.’ \nSo with that in mind, what are the alternatives to HRT for managing menopausal symptoms?\nAcupuncture\nA study looking at the effects of acupuncture on the vasomotor symptoms of menopause (that means hot flushes and night sweats) concluded that acupuncture treatments were linked to a reduction in these symptoms compared to no acupuncture. Not only was the reduction significant, but the effects continued 6 months after the end of treatment.\nAcupuncture has also been found to offer positive effects in the treatment of anxiety in those with generalised anxiety disorder (GAD). More studies are needed to prove a beneficial link between acupuncture and menopausal anxiety. But the findings so far are promising.\nHow to seek help for menopausal anxiety\nLooking again at the survey from the British Menopause Society, 50% of women aged 45-65 who experienced menopause between 2006 and 2016, did not consult a healthcare professional about their menopause symptoms. Let’s change that!\nIf you are suffering with anxiety – or any other symptom due to menopause – speak to someone who can help. Talk to a healthcare professional, or get advice on HRT options with one of our brilliant women’s health doctors here at The Lowdown. You don’t need to suffer alone.\nIf you’re nervous about discussing your symptoms, why not keep a symptom diary? It can help remind you what you want to say, as well as being helpful for noticing any patterns in your symptoms.\n\nLaura Keyes is a freelance content writer living in Cornwall.

        "Title": "Should I worry about heavy periods?",
        "Content": "\n✅ If you think this blog sound interesting, make sure to check out our newsletter for more:\n\nWhat are heavy periods?\nDid you know that people who menstruate can lose around 5 – 12 teaspoons of blood every month? For some, they may lose more than 12 teaspoons. But what does this really mean? What do twelve teaspoons of blood look like when using tampons and sanitary towels? And how do you know if your periods are heavy?\nTo figure out whether you have heavy periods, you may wish to consider the following:\n\nDo you change a tampon or pad every couple of hours?\nDo you need to empty your menstrual cup sooner than the instructions suggest?\nDo you often bleed through clothes and use two different products to better protect against leakage?\n\nIf the answer is ‘yes’, you may have heavy periods –  or menorrhagia, to give it its technical term. Heavy periods with blood clots larger than 2.5cm and bleeds lasting longer than seven days all indicate heavy bleeding periods. In essence, periods that are heavy enough to disrupt your normal daily life and require your attention.\nWhy are my periods so heavy?\nEliminating an underlying cause for heavy periods should be your first port of call. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, fibroids and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) are all possibilities. So consider a trip to your GP to rule these conditions out. It is not uncommon for periods to be heavy, and this may be what’s normal for you. That doesn’t mean you have to suffer in silence, however. Treatment options – such as tranexamic acid – are available to you.\nIs it normal to have heavy periods?\nWhen you first start your period, you may experience heavy bleeds. Likewise, after pregnancy and during the menopause, heavy periods can be normal. For others, no obvious cause has been found. Menorrhagia is common and could just be how your periods are, but for some people this can impact on their mood and physical health, and can significantly affect daily life. So it’s important to be aware of which treatment options are available – more on this in a moment.\nDo heavy periods affect fertility?\nThere are many elements to be considered when looking at factors that can impact fertility, including alcohol intake, smoking, weight and age. Whilst heavy periods themselves do not cause infertility, they can be a symptom of other conditions which are linked to problems with conceiving. Blocked fallopian tubes from PID, and the absence of regular ovulation in PCOS and endometriosis are all common causes of fertility problems. As previously mentioned, these can be a cause of heavy periods. Complications due to fibroids may result in fertility problems, but only in rare circumstances.\n\nPolycystic ovary syndrome impacts ovulation and prevents the regular release of an egg, which can make conception trickier – however with treatment, most women are able to conceive. Pelvic inflammatory disease, or PID, is most commonly caused by a sexually transmitted infection, such as gonorrhoea or chlamydia. It often causes no symptoms but can result in the scarring and narrowing of the fallopian tubes. This creates a challenge for the egg to pass through the tubes to the womb from the ovaries and increases the risk of an ectopic pregnancy. Pelvic inflammatory disease can lead to issues with fertility, particularly in those who delay seeking treatment. (Another great reason to book that STI check-up!)\nWhen to worry about heavy periods\nIn rare circumstances, heavy periods can be a sign of womb cancer. It’s important to see a doctor if you’ve had heavy periods for a while, if your periods are extremely painful, if you experience bleeding between periods or after sex, and if your heavy periods are accompanied by pain during sex, peeing or pooing.\nDue to the larger loss of blood you experience during a heavy period, you may be at risk of anaemia. Known as an iron-deficiency, anaemia can lead to headaches, tiredness and breathlessness. A simple blood test carried out by your doctor can determine if this is an underlying cause.\nYou should also see a doctor if your periods are interfering with your everyday life and are causing you distress. We have a great team of doctors here at The Lowdown who are passionate about women’s health and helping you. You never have to suffer in silence, our GPs are always here to listen to your concerns. Booking an appointment is easy, convenient and you’ll wish you’d done it sooner! We also have an excellent pelvic health physiotherapist who can offer advice on managing conditions like endometriosis, which can cause heavy periods.\nTreatment for heavy periods\nDreading every month due to the worry of really heavy periods is a misery you don’t have to endure. Tranexamic acid is a non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used in the treatment of heavy periods. It is a non-hormonal option, perfect for those looking to avoid hormonal treatments. It works to control bleeding by helping the blood to clot. Tranexamic acid reduces menstrual blood loss by up to 50%. It is only taken for a short time each month to control your monthly bleeding. Usually this is two (500mg) tablets taken three to four times a day, for the first three to four days of your period. Tranexamic acid is now available to buy over the counter from pharmacies — just ask for Evana Heavy Period Relief tablets.\nThe hormonal coil (IUS) is another effective treatment for heavy periods. By releasing progestogen, the lining of the womb is thinned. Periods become lighter, less frequent, and may stop completely. The IUS should not be confused with the IUD, aka the copper coil. This can have the opposite effect and sometimes makes periods heavier! The copper coil is an effective contraception and a great non-hormonal choice, but is best avoided by those experiencing heavy periods.\nEvidence shows that the use of combined hormonal contraceptives results in lighter periods. The combined pill, the patch, and vaginal ring can all be used to help manage heavy periods and period pain. It may also be beneficial to use combined hormonal contraceptives continuously, avoiding withdrawal bleeds, with studies showing an advantage over the more traditional cyclical use (with breaks) in the short term. Tranexamic acid is generally safe and can be taken with most other medicines, however you should speak to your doctor or pharmacist if you’re taking the combined pill as there could be a very small increased risk of getting a blood clot if you take tranexamic acid as well. We’re really excited that tranexamic acid will soon be available to buy directly from The Lowdown! Keep an eye out for updates.\n\nIn the mean time, investing in some period pants could make a big difference to your heavy periods. Period pants, such as Modibodi or WUKA, are a sustainable form of menstrual care that can be washed and re-used. Modibodi in particular can hold up to 3-4 tampons worth of blood in the lining!\nLaura Keyes is a freelance content writer living in Cornwall.

        "Title": "What is vaginal atrophy?",
        "Content": "\n–\nRiddle me this: It’s dry, itchy, occasionally painful, and hates sex. It’s… your vagina. Unfortunately, vaginal atrophy and genitourinary syndrome of menopause is a reality for more of us than we let on.  \n👀 If you think you’ll find this blog interesting, make sure to check out our newsletter for more:\n\nWhat is genitourinary syndrome of menopause?\nMore often than not it isn’t your vagina alone giving you grief. The majority of women experiencing symptoms of vaginal atrophy will likely also have urinary and other pelvic problems. This is why vaginal atrophy as a term is now covered under the umbrella of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM). This reflects the full spectrum of symptoms that can affect the vulva, vagina and urinary tract due to low oestrogen levels in the time leading up to, during and after the menopause. It is a complex group of symptoms and problems involving both your genital and urinary tissues and can affect each one of us differently. \nWhat is vaginal atrophy?\nVaginal atrophy describes the thinning of the vaginal tissue due to a decrease in oestrogen. Oestrogen assists with keeping the lining of the vagina elastic, thick and well lubricated; so when oestrogen levels drop, your oestrogen sensitive tissues tend to flake on you. This process typically happens during menopause when your body naturally slows down the production of oestrogen as your reproductive years come to an end. The average age of menopause in the UK is 51 and symptoms can start years before this. This can however also happen to anyone with a vagina who is younger than 45 and not necessarily past or going through menopause. \nSymptoms of vaginal atrophy include (but are definitely not limited to): \n\nFeeling itchy around your vulva. The skin and tissue here is some of the most sensitive in our body so if something isn’t right, you’ll know about it \nVaginal dryness \nFeeling soreness around your vulva and the entrance of the vagina. Burning is often a term used to describe the type of pain.\nPain during or after sex. This often happens at the entrance of the vagina and is referred to as ‘superficial dyspareunia’ \nLight bleeding after sex. This is due to small breaks in the fragile vaginal tissue – think cracked and dry skin – which may bleed\nUrinary symptoms. The tissues around the urinary tract are also sensitive to hormonal changes. Symptoms include increased frequency (needing to pee more often), urgency (needing to pee NOW), dysuria (painful pee) and nocturia (annoyingly waking up during the night to pee). Urinary tract infections are commonly linked to vaginal atrophy and dryness.\nDecreased arousal, lubrication, orgasm and desire. (This is the actual worst, but we have a great webinar on sex, libidos and orgasms if this is getting you down)\n\nWhat are the causes of vaginal atrophy/GSM?\nFor most, it’s the often dreaded menopause that starts the domino effect low oestrogen brings. However, not only those going through menopause are affected by this. Medical treatments such as certain types of chemotherapy and/or radiation treatment, and surgical removal of your ovaries, as well as childbirth, breastfeeding and some hormonal contraceptives (especially those containing only progestogen) can cause symptoms associated with vaginal atrophy and GSM. \nHow common is vaginal atrophy/GSM?\nIn short – very! Studies from across the globe have proved that vaginal atrophy/GSM is common and terribly under-reported. One study showed GSM affects a whopping 70% of post-menopausal women in Spain, the majority of which were undiagnosed. Another study found that 19% of 40 to 45 year old women and 50% of postmenopausal women in the UK experienced GSM. \nWhat are the differences between vaginal atrophy and vaginal dryness?\nAlthough seemingly very similar and often confused for one another – vaginal dryness is a symptom (something experienced by you) of vaginal atrophy/GSM (the condition) rather than a condition on its own. Vaginal dryness can also be associated with other conditions such as infections.\nWhat are the differences between vaginal atrophy and a yeast infection?\nVaginal dryness and some other symptoms associated with vaginal atrophy/GSM may also be experienced if you have a yeast infection known as thrush. Symptoms include soreness and itching around the vulva, pain around the entrance to the vagina during sex, inflamed skin that bleeds easily and stinging when passing urine. Thrush does not affect your oestrogen levels or lead to vaginal atrophy. \nYeast infections or thrush tend to have the hallmark symptom of thick, white discharge as well as vaginal irritation, itching and urinary symptoms. This is caused by the overgrowth of yeast cells which naturally occur within the vagina, the most common being Candida. Causes of thrush include recent use of antibiotics, the use of intimate hygiene products and an immune system which isn’t functioning well.\nPotential complications of vaginal atrophy/genitourinary syndrome\nQuality of life \nQuality of life is going at the top of my list because, historically, it’s been left off altogether. GONE are the days where women past a certain age (or in this case a certain vaginal status) are put onto the proverbial shelf. And it’s about time. One study in the USA showed that 80% of women experiencing vaginal discomfort due to GSM felt it had a negative impact on their life. Loss of intimacy, reduced sexual enjoyment and a negative effect on sleep were also noted as complications.\nInfections\nChanges in vaginal tissue due to low oestrogen can make you more prone to infections or changes in the vaginal microbiome, leading to conditions such as bacterial vaginosis and thrush. Likewise you may be prone to urinary tract infections (UTIs).\nPelvic floor muscle weakness \nUrinary incontinence (usually stress incontinence, i.e the post-sneeze pee) and pelvic organ prolapse are some of the complications due to having weakened pelvic floor muscles. This is because oestrogen also has a positive effect on muscle tissue. For more advice on keeping a healthy pelvic floor and other conditions, speak to our pelvic health physiotherapist.\nHow to treat vaginal atrophy/genitourinary syndrome\nRecognition of menopause and hormone related conditions has thankfully improved drastically over the last few years with the increasing emphasis on women’s health (it’s about time!). Ideally, the aim of treatment is to get you and your vagina back to 100% by replacing what’s missing, which in most cases, is oestrogen! Multiple options are available to improve symptoms including systemic hormone replacement therapy (HRT), vaginal oestrogen cream and other strategies to help relieve symptoms. \nHormone replacement therapy (HRT)\nFor people struggling with other menopausal symptoms, such as hot flushes or low mood, as well as GSM symptoms, replacement oestrogen can be prescribed. This can be in the form of pills, patches, gels or sprays, for example. You’ll need your doctor to go through the risks and benefits and prescribe this treatment for you. For the majority, HRT provides more benefits than risks. If you have a womb you’ll need to take progesterone alongside oestrogen, as oestrogen alone can promote overgrowth of the womb lining. This is usually effective in treating most of the symptoms of menopause but unfortunately 10 to 25% of those on HRT will still have ongoing vaginal atrophy/GSM symptoms. Testosterone replacement can also be effective at helping symptoms of GSM, but is usually only prescribed for women experiencing reduced sexual desire despite taking HRT. \nVaginal oestrogen\nSometimes, you just need to add what’s missing directly to where it’s needed. Oestrogen-containing gels, creams, pessaries and rings applied directly to the vagina have been found to be very effective and usually provide a quick improvement in vulval, vaginal and urinary symptoms, although it can take a couple of months for you to notice beneficial effects. Treatment with vaginal oestrogen is safe and can be used in the long term to manage symptoms. Vaginal oestrogen will soon be available to purchase from The Lowdown – so keep your eyes peeled for updates!\nWomen with a history of breast cancer can usually use vaginal oestrogen but will need to discuss the risks and benefits with a doctor who can then prescribe this for them. Pessaries containing Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) – a mouthful, we know – inserted into the vagina are an alternative. DHEA has also been shown to improve GSM symptoms as it is transformed into oestrogen in the body.\nSymptomatic treatment \nWE LOVE LUBE! And you should too. Water-based lubes are best, as oil-based can make a bad situation worse by causing irritation and have shown to make latex condoms less effective. Vaginal moisturisers are also available and often help with vulval sensitivity. \nGet Yes water-based lube from Amazon (we love this and earn a small commission).\nA few final lifestyle tips\nWe’ve said it before and we’ll say it again, please please please don’t douche. Intimate hygiene products often make things worse by altering vaginal pH. Wearing looser clothing, avoiding perfumed panty liners and not wearing synthetic underwear may help manage GSM symptoms. Similarly, stopping (or never starting) smoking and maintaining a healthy lifestyle can contribute to symptom improvement as well as your overall health.\nWhen to see a doctor about vaginal atrophy\nHormone replacement therapy will require a prescription and therefore, a trip to your GP. This is because certain risks and benefits involved with the use of HRT need to be evaluated to make sure you’re being managed safely. These include a previous personal or a family history of certain cancers. Women still need to consider contraception until they are effectively post menopausal and this can be used alongside or instead of HRT.\nSigns that something else might be going on include recurrent infections or symptoms despite completing or ongoing treatment, unintended loss of weight, new or irregular bleeding and unusual discharge. If you’re having any of these symptoms or just aren’t sure, it’s best to get a professional’s advice. We have a team of amazing women’s health GPs at The Lowdown who can assist in answering any questions you might have.\n1) Waetjen, E. et al, 2018.

With over 500 different species of bacteria that call your vagina ‘home’, these microbes are essential for a fully functional reproductive system and indeed, body. Which is exactly what we’re looking for during one of the body’s most stressful encounters – pregnancy. \nWhat is bacterial vaginosis?\nBacterial vaginosis (BV) is an imbalance, or over-dominance, of one or more bacterial groups living within your vagina. No one likes a dictatorship, least of all your vagina, so when the balance is wobbled, everything tends to function a little less well than it should. One of the most common bacteria to call your vagina ‘home’ are Lactobacilli which keeps the other bacteria in check! A few things do occasionally catch Lactobacilli off guard and allow other bacteria to dominate, leading to symptoms we’d all rather avoid. This isn’t necessarily led by one type of bacteria, as a few species have been noted in research to be particularly fond of taking over.\nBacterial vaginosis symptoms in pregnancy\nA hallmark symptom of BV is a grey or white fishy-smelling discharge which commonly occurs after having sex. Up to 50% of women won’t have any symptoms at all and currently, screening people for BV who don’t have symptoms isn’t recommended. \nConfirming the diagnosis of BV can be done based on your symptoms and an examination by your doctor or nurse. Sometimes this can include a simple test to check the pH of your vagina with a strip of specially coated paper and a cotton wool swab of the vagina and discharge. This can be looked at under a microscope to identify clue cells (cells from your vaginal wall that change to a fuzzy appearance due to bacterial coating).\nA change in discharge is often associated with sexually transmitted infections (STIs), so get an STI test if you think you might be at risk, and remember that condoms are still the only contraceptive method that protects you from STIs.\nBV is not considered an STI but being sexually active without barrier protection such as a condom may increase your risk of BV and BV recurrence. Other risk factors include having an IUS or IUD, using intimate ‘hygiene’ products (please don’t!) and recent oral antibiotic treatment (which often kills off some bacteria required to keep the balance and may lead to other problems such as thrush). We have an indepth blog on the causes of bacterial vaginosis and treatment here* for you to learn more. \nRisks of having bacterial vaginosis whilst pregnant\nMore often than not BV is only temporary, swiftly leaving your body without any symptoms or complications. However if you’re pregnant and bacterial vaginosis doesn’t clear up, there are some potential complications. \nPremature labour (labour starting before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy), spontaneous miscarriages and infections of the womb (both before and after delivery) are complications associated with BV during pregnancy. Luckily these complications rarely occur, especially if you are not showing symptoms or have been treated. Currently, in the UK you will only be tested for BV if you are experiencing symptoms as studies have shown no change in outcomes for pregnant women treated for BV without symptoms. If you think you might have BV and you are pregnant, you should speak to your doctor or midwife. \nBV is associated with getting STIs more readily as your vaginal tissues may be damaged by the bacterial imbalance. STIs hold their own set of nasty risks and complications whilst pregnant which can affect both you and your baby, sometimes very seriously. So if you’re in doubt about if your discharge or other symptoms are due to BV or an STI, get medical advice. \nCan bacterial vaginosis prevent pregnancy?\nIn short, no. One study found that BV had no direct effect on conception or fertility but there is a lack of research on the subject. There also isn’t enough evidence to link BV with other conditions such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) which may cause damage to your reproductive organs, making falling pregnant more challenging. More research is needed to figure out the role that BV and the normal bacteria in your vagina may play in fertility. \nTreatment for bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy\nPrevention of bacterial vaginosis is better than cure! So if you’re pregnant, trying to conceive, or even trying to avoid pregnancy, these interventions may help you avoid BV: \n\nLess sex (Don’t panic, move to point two!) \nSex with a condom\nDon’t use a vaginal douche, your vagina is self-cleaning. Instead use clean, warm water to clean the vulva – outside of your vagina \nStop smoking. Smoking is not only a risk factor for BV but is detrimental to your overall health and your pregnancy\n\nIf you’re pregnant and think you may have BV, speak to your doctor. Medical treatment is usually straightforward with antibiotics, a cream or gel applied into the vagina, or oral tablets. Antibiotics such as clindamycin and metronidazole are prescribed for 5 to 7 days. Your body may sort the imbalance out on its own and antibiotics may not be needed, but it is important to discuss this with your doctor or healthcare practitioner in pregnancy. \nRecurrence of BV is often a problem, which sucks. This study suggests that rates of recurrence are as high as 80% three months after effective treatment. Management of risk factors and stopping what might be causing the problem in the first place is important for managing recurrent BV. \nOver the counter self treatment options like relactagel are also available and safe to use in pregnancy to prevent recurrent BV. Speak to your doctor or health care practitioner to find what’s best for you. However, Relactagel should be avoided if you’re trying to become pregnant as semen may be neutralized by the lactic acid gel.\nWhen to speak to a doctor\nIf you have symptoms of BV and are pregnant, getting a doctor’s input is the best way to go as correct testing and proper treatment can be done quickly to avoid any complications. \nSimilarly, if you’re trying to fall pregnant and have recurrent BV symptoms a GP should be able to talk you through addressing any risk factors and when to seek advice when pregnant.\nDr Brenna Weaver MBChB (WITS) is a South African trained doctor, who became passionate about women’s health whilst working in under-resourced, rural communities, doing everything from Caesarean sections to contraceptive drives.\n",

        "Title": "What happens if bacterial vaginosis is left untreated?",
        "Content": "\n✅ If you think you’ll find this blog useful, make sure to check out our newsletter for more:\n\nAs with most things in life, your vagina likes to be in balance. One move too far up the pH scale or a change in hormonal balance and things can get messy. The balance of bacteria in your vagina, known as the microbiome, is no exception.Your vagina hosts more than 500 types of bacteria alone which help your vagina function as it should. \nThe most common bacteria is Lactobacilli which, acting as a security guard of sorts, keeps the other bugs that call your vagina home in check. A few things can catch this security guard off duty causing all hell to break loose – cue smelly discharge and sadness. \nSometimes, this balance of bacteria is altered which can lead to a condition called bacterial vaginosis (BV), something up to 50% of women in the UK struggle with and is the most common cause of abnormal discharge in people who menstruate. Despite years of study and speculation on the cause of bacterial vaginosis, no direct cause has been found. Ugh. However, we do know that a few things increase your chances of getting BV and can trigger a recurrence…\nWhat can cause bacterial vaginosis?\nVaginal pH\nYour vagina should naturally have an acidic pH, but there are some factors that can throw this off balance, increasing your risk of infection.  Vaginal douching, the use of intimate ‘hygiene’ products, having an IUD (both copper and hormonal), your period, and semen can all be responsible for a climb up the pH ladder. \nDuring menstruation, as if bleeding for 3 to 7 days wasn’t enough already, your vaginal pH naturally rises opening the door to potential BV. The jury is still out as to exactly why the coil may be linked to BV but theories include changes to bleeding patterns and irregular periods due to the hormonal coil (IUS) or copper coil (IUD) causing  pH swings. True to the concept of opposites attracting, semen is alkaline and therefore increases your vaginal pH which can trigger BV. This is one of the reasons why being sexually active is considered to increase your BV risk, and symptoms of BV like a strong fishy smell occur after sex. Although BV is not itself an STI.\nRecent antibiotic therapy\nModern medicine is a wonder, but we still haven’t quite figured out how to kill off the nasty bacteria, wherever it may be in your body, whilst leaving all of the good ones alone. Taking oral antibiotics may kill off too many of the vaginal Lactobacilli that are holding down the fort, and lead to conditions like thrush as well as bacterial vaginosis. \nEthnicity\nStudies have shown that BV affects around up to 55% of black women compared to up to 15% of caucasian women. Women are often underrepresented in medical research, black and ethnic minority women even more so, so there is still research to be done as to why conditions like thrush and BV disproportionately affect them. One possible reason could be that black women have a more diverse vaginal microbiome, whereas white women have a more Lactobacillus-dominated microbiome – i.e. the bacteria that keeps your pH balance in check.\nLifestyle\nSmoking\nThe effect of smoking on the balance of bacteria in the vagina is two fold. Firstly, it encourages the production of the BV causing bacteria and its by-products, which produce the fishy smell, and secondly, smoking prevents the vaginal tissue from responding to oestrogen, which helps to maintain strong, healthy vaginal tissue. Evidence shows that smoking weakens your immune system making it harder to prevent and clear high-risk HPV infections that could lead to cervical cancer. Smoking also has other significant detrimental effects on your overall health too, so it’s 10/10 recommended to kick the habit.\nSame sex partners\nLesbians, listen up! You and your partner may have similar vaginal lactobacilli which can decrease your protective measures and increase your chances of getting BV. \nOral sex\nAlthough oral sex is an essential part of a healthy sex life for many of us, exposing your vaginal bacteria to someone’s mouth bacteria can confuse all bacteria involved and lead to BV. \nDoes the coil cause bacterial vaginosis?\nUsing the copper coil may be associated with a higher risk of bacterial vaginosis of up to 28% compared to not using any contraception. Unfortunately, studies haven’t looked into the hormonal coil in as much detail. It seems that when a coil is removed, the risk of BV goes back down to baseline.\nHow do I know if I have bacterial vaginosis?\nBV can be, and often is, asymptomatic, meaning you won’t have any symptoms, and may resolve on its own in a lot of cases. It is also usually harmless and many of us won’t know or realise we’ve had recurring bouts of BV throughout our lives. However, the hallmark symptoms of bacterial vaginosis are watery discharge (often clear or grey) and a fishy or unpleasant smell. \nDiagnosis is usually made by your doctor or nurse, but there are some tests they can do when examining you, including testing your vaginal pH (using a small paper test strip), that can assist with diagnosing BV. If you’re someone who has had BV in the past you may recognise the characteristic symptoms when they recur.\nWill bacterial vaginosis go away on its own?\nYes bacterial vaginosis can go away on its own and you probably won’t even know it is happening. 50% of women who have bacterial vaginosis may be asymptomatic and under current guidelines, screening people who don’t have symptoms for BV is not recommended. Some people are aware of their risk factors or triggers and are able to manage these to help reduce recurrences of BV. \nHow long does it take for bacterial vaginosis to clear up? \nBV can clear up on its own but it is difficult to say how long this might take, as every vagina is different and the circumstances which trigger BV will differ between people. If you’re experiencing a BV flare up during your period, symptoms usually resolve within a few days of your finishing your bleed as the pH normalises on its own. If you require treatment however, symptoms usually resolve within 5 to 7 days.\nTreatment for BV is currently only recommended for those experiencing symptoms, as studies have shown that there’s generally no benefit in treatment for those without, compared to allowing the bacterial vaginosis to go away on its own. \nWhat can happen if bacterial vaginosis is left untreated?\nBacterial vaginosis is not usually something you need to worry about; a huge number of us won’t even know we have it and it generally won’t cause any harm. Some of the risk factors for BV may be troublesome, though. Unfortunately, like that ex who just WON’T go away, recurrence is a problem and so far there’s no telling why this happens. Not being properly diagnosed, having a sexually transmitted infection (STI) at the same time, or ineffective treatment to start with are among some of the culprits, as well as not addressing ongoing risk factors. This study also suggests that rates of recurring BV are as high as 80% three months after effective treatment.\nSTIs in particular need to be addressed as they can be spread and lead to further complications, so make sure you know the STI symptoms to look out for. The good news is that condom use is effective in keeping both away! A little reminder: condoms are the only form of contraception to protect you against STIs.\nBV can increase the risk of STIs\nChlamydia and gonorrhoea are among the STIs described to be associated with BV. A high level of anaerobic organisms (bugs that don’t require oxygen to function) can cause damage to the vaginal wall which can increase the risk of getting infections. There is also interesting research to suggest that your main groups of normal vaginal bacteria may be protective against certain infections such as HPV. So keeping your vaginal bacteria in tip-top shape is well worth the effort. \nComplications during pregnancy\nPremature labour, miscarriage and womb infections are linked to having BV during pregnancy. Often though, as with those of us who aren’t carrying a baby, pregnant women don’t have any symptoms and the majority don’t have any problems. Currently in the UK you will only be tested for BV in pregnancy if you have symptoms. There is also currently no evidence to support treating BV in women who are pregnant who do not have symptoms but your doctor would discuss this with you.\n\nPelvic inflammatory disease (PID)\nCommonly caused by STIs like chlamydia and gonorrhoea, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) can also be caused by bacteria naturally occuring in the vagina, however there is no specific link to BV. Research shows that while some bugs cross over the two conditions, a direct relationship has not been found. \nWhat is the best way to treat bacterial vaginosis?\nYour body is pretty smart and your vaginal microbiome is usually restored all on its own. Managing risk factors and figuring out your triggers often does the trick.\nOther options include lactic acid gels, such as Relactagel, which encourages your normal vaginal bacteria and restores your normal pH. This can be used to prevent BV as well as treat it if you’re prone to recurrences. \nTraditional treatment consists of simple antibiotic therapy. Either administered in tablets to swallow or a gel or pessary to place in the vagina. The most commonly used are metronidazole and clindamycin. \nThese antibiotics are usually prescribed for 5 to 7 days, however if symptoms recur then treatment may be as long as six months. One off, high dose treatment with metronidazole can also be offered to non-pregnant women. \nKeep in mind that if you have a same sex partner, they may also need to be treated. \nWhat to do if your bacterial vaginosis doesn’t clear after treatment\nIf your symptoms haven’t gone away after treatment it’s best to speak to your GP or sexual health clinic to make sure that nothing else is going on. You should consider whether you need an STI test as these can have similar symptoms to BV. Other conditions such as thrush may also be mistaken for BV. Your doctor or nurse can also help you identify risk factors or triggers.  We also have wonderful women’s health doctors at the Lowdown who can run through your symptoms with you to figure out what might be going on.\n\n\n\nDr Brenna Weaver MBChB (WITS) is a South African trained doctor, who became passionate about women’s health whilst working in under-resourced, rural communities, doing everything from Caesarean sections to contraceptive drives.\n",

        "Title": "Do I have thrush or an STI?",
        "Content": "\n👀 If you think this blog will interest you, make sure to check out our newsletter:\n\nA lot of us have been there, and some of us more than a few times: thrush can be painful, uncomfortable and frankly inconvenient. What’s arguably just as inconvenient, though, is thrush’s profile of symptoms, and how similar they are to the symptoms associated with some STIs. It’s no surprise, then, that we often find ourselves asking the question: is it thrush or an STI? \nBoth thrush and STIs can affect both men and women, although women are more likely to get thrush, for reasons we’ll explain in a moment. Thrush can also occur in the mouth – it’s quite common in babies – and other parts of the body, but as women’s health is sort of our thing, we’ll be focusing on vaginal thrush here.\nDo I have thrush or an STI?\nFirst things first, it’s important to clarify: thrush is not an STI. While it can be triggered or passed on during sex, sex is far from the only way you can get thrush (and, in fact, isn’t very common at all). STIs, on the other hand, are passed from person to person through sexual activity, but can have similar symptoms to thrush, so it can be tricky to know exactly what it is you’re dealing with. \nSimilarities between thrush and an STI\nThrush shares its symptoms with some STIs, including discharge, itching and pain. Sometimes, a woman can believe she has thrush when in reality, it’s a different infection altogether. These shared symptoms, though, are where the similarities end.\nDifferences between thrush and an STI\nThrush is a fungal infection that’s at its happiest in a warm, damp environment, like the vagina (hence it being more common in women than men). It occurs from the overgrowth of a particular yeast called Candida (this is the reason you might have heard the term ‘yeast infection’). This yeast grows naturally in the bowel and small amounts of it live naturally in and around the vagina without causing any problems. It’s when the amount of this fungus gets too high that thrush occurs, and this usually happens due to an imbalance of bacteria that normally keep Candida in check within the vagina or vulva itself. \nThrush isn’t an STI, but friction during sex can cause minor damage and tears to the vagina or vulva, making Candida more likely to proliferate. If you’re pregnant, on antibiotics, or have a weakened immune system, you could be more likely to develop thrush. \nSTIs, on the other hand, are the result of viruses or bacteria. There are lots of different types, and you can read more about them in our dedicated STI guide. \nThrush can be recurrent, meaning you can experience multiple episodes of the infection and, despite treatment, it often returns. It is estimated that around 138 million women are affected by recurrent thrush every year.\nSymptoms of thrush\nSymptoms of thrush include:\n\nUnusual, white, cottage-cheese-like discharge\nBurning or pain while urinating\nPain, itching, redness or swelling of the vulva\nFeeling pain or stinging during sex\n\nSymptoms of an STI\nThere are many different STIs, and each has its own list of associated symptoms, which you can read about in our STI guide. Some common symptoms include:\n\nUnusual discharge\nBurning or pain while urinating\nPain, itching, redness or swelling of your genitals\nFeeling pain or stinging during sex\nAn unpleasant smell\nAbnormal bleeding\nPain in the lower abdomen\n\nWhat to do if you think you have thrush\nIf you’re pretty confident you have thrush, simple over the counter treatments or lifestyle changes may be all you need. If however you’re not sure, or you think you may be at risk of an STI, get checked out at your sexual health clinic or GP surgery. \nOnce you’ve established that it is thrush that you’re dealing with, there are several treatment options available to you. Depending on your circumstances, you can use a cream, pessary or tablet – or a combination of these. Symptoms should clear up within 7 to 14 days of starting treatment. Here’s a breakdown of each treatment and who it might be suitable for:\nThrush tablet \nFor most people, an oral antifungal medication is the best way to treat thrush. Fluconazole is the most common oral antifungal medication. It’s usually taken just once as a single dose and that’s it. Although this dose can be repeated if necessary. Occasionally, people experience side effects, the most common being nausea and diarrhoea. You shouldn’t take tablets for thrush if you are pregnant. \nThrush pessary \nA pessary is a tablet that you insert into your vagina. The most common antifungal pessary medication is clotrimazole, which you’ll often find under the brand name Canesten which you can buy from Amazon (our affiliate link btw!). Clotrimazole is often recommended for pregnant women, as they cannot take oral tablets. \nHow many pessaries you take and how long for depends on the strength of Clotrimazole you are taking. A 500mg pessary, is commonly used just once as a single-dose treatment.\nLike all medications, clotrimazole comes with potential side effects. These include swelling, pain or discomfort in or around the vagina, lower abdomen or pelvic pain, vaginal bleeding and stinging or burning after inserting the pessary. Most people don’t experience  these side effects, and they should disappear once you have finished your treatment but speak to your doctor if they are severe or don’t go away. \nCream\nClotrimazole is available as an external cream as well as a pessary. The cream is applied externally to the vulva (not inside the vagina itself) and works to clear up external thrush and relieve symptoms. You can use an external cream at the same time as a pessary or tablet. The most common side effect of clotrimazole as an external cream is itching and burning of the area where it has been applied. Clotrimazole cream can clear up the symptoms of thrush in seven days, but it’s recommended that you keep using it for at least a couple of weeks to stop your symptoms returning.\nNot sure if it’s thrush, or whether any of these treatments are right for you? We have doctors on hand who can give you impartial advice about your options or contact your GP or sexual health clinic.\nWhat to do if you think you have an STI\nIf you suspect that you have an STI, your first port of call should be to go to your local sexual health clinic or GP for a screening. Here, your doctor or nurse might do a physical examination, a swab test or a blood test to see whether you have an STI. If you’d like to read more about different STIs and their symptoms, we have an article all about them – but remember, STI symptoms can overlap, and self-diagnosis is rarely helpful. You’ll usually need swabs to investigate and appropriate treatment from a healthcare professional. If you don’t have any symptoms but think you may be at risk of an STI, your sexual health clinic may provide a service where you can do your vaginal swab yourself. You can also speak to one of our brilliant doctors if you’re unsure and would like some advice.\nPreventing thrush\nThere are certain environments in which thrush thrives, and particular behaviours can make it easier or more difficult for thrush to take hold. If you’re struggling with thrush, or are experiencing recurrent infections, it is recommended that you don’t use any harsh chemicals near the affected area, like soap or deodorant. Instead, the NHS recommends that you wash with an emollient, like E45 cream, and water. Try to take showers instead of baths, and be sure to dry off properly once you’ve washed, too; thrush thrives in warm, damp conditions. \nThe type of underwear you use can also impact your chances of getting (or re-getting) thrush; try to wear looser, cotton underwear where you can, and avoid tights or other clothing that sits tightly against your vulva. Lastly, if your thrush is painful or uncomfortable, avoid sex until it has cleared up to prevent making your symptoms worse. \nDifferent types of contraception may increase your risk of thrush or recurrent thrush. For example, the oestrogen in the combined pill can be associated with thrush. Some coil users who suffer from recurrent thrush that won’t respond to treatment, may wish to look at other options using our birth control recommender.\nPreventing STIs\nSTIs are passed on through direct physical contact; if your genitals come into direct contact with the genitals of someone with an STI (or the mouth or anus, in some cases), you put yourself at risk of catching it. The only way to really prevent the passing on of an STI is to use barrier methods of contraception (so-called because they put a barrier between you and the other person). There are two barrier methods that provide good protection against STIs: the female condom and the male condom. The male condom is better at preventing pregnancy than the female condom, and is generally considered the better option for STI prevention because it is easier to use.\nWhat to do if you’re still unsure\nIf you’re still not sure whether what you’re experiencing is thrush or an STI, it’s important that you speak to a healthcare professional. This could be your GP or a doctor or nurse at your local sexual health clinic.\nWe also have some brilliant doctors here at The Lowdown. Each has a diploma in sexual and reproductive health on top of their medical degree and postgraduate GP training, and offers full twenty-minute appointments to make sure you’re given the space and time you need. If you decide to book a consultation with us, you’ll receive a full action plan after your appointment, detailing your next steps.\n\nMary Hargreaves is a writer and author with a passion for women’s reproductive health.

        "Title": "Talking to your partner about contraception, your menstrual cycle and shared responsibility",
        "Content": "\nAt The Lowdown we firmly believe that preventing unplanned pregnancy is a shared responsibility between partners – long term or otherwise. So, we’ve put together a guide on getting your partner clued up about your monthly cycle, when you’re actually most likely to get pregnant, and what they need to know about contraception and how it can affect you.\nWhy shared responsibility is important when it comes to contraception\nCurrently, all hormonal methods of contraception (and most non hormonal methods) that are available are intended for use by those of us with a uterus. Whether that’s taking a daily pill or tracking your monthly cycles. This has left a disproportionate weight – or burden – on women and people with vaginas to ensure effective use of contraception to prevent pregnancy. While there are some promising developments in male contraception, including a non-hormonal male contraceptive pill, many are still in trial stages and a long way off from being widely available. In the meantime, any partners you have should probably be taking an interest in what’s going on inside your body if you’re both aiming to avoid pregnancy.\nSo, how does the menstrual cycle work?\nIf you’re not totally clued up yourself on how the menstrual cycle works, let alone your partner, we’ve got you covered. There’s more to it than just ovulating (when the ovaries release an egg) a few days a month, as the menstrual cycle has two distinct phases, before ovulation and after:\n\nThe follicular phase before ovulation is signalled by the start of your period which is considered ‘day 1’ of your cycle. This is when the uterus is preparing for ovulation by getting the womb lining in peak condition for implantation of a fertilised egg. \nDuring ovulation, a mature egg is released into the fallopian tube, staying around for 12-24 hours. This is when you’re at your most fertile, and the egg will either be fertilised by sperm, or flushed out of the body if not. \nThe luteal phase, after ovulation, maintains the womb lining in case an egg is fertilised so it can implant in the womb lining, resulting in pregnancy. Otherwise, the womb lining breaks down and the cycle begins again.\n\n \nWhy is it useful for your partner to understand how your cycle works?\nBoth you and your partner can use signs of ovulation, such as changes in body temperature and the days of your menstrual cycle, to work out when you will ovulate and therefore when you’re most likely to be fertile. This is the basis for fertility awareness methods (FAM) of contraception, also known as natural family planning. You can learn to do this with a fertility awareness practitioner the old fashioned way, or use the Natural Cycles app to work this out for you. This allows you to know when your fertile days are and when additional contraception like condoms are needed, and also your non fertile days where unprotected sex is allowed!\nIt’s important to remember the withdrawal method, also known as the pull out method, is only 80 to 90% effective (which sounds like a lot, but this is way less than other contraceptives, and leaves a 10 to 20% chance of unintended pregnancy!). The withdrawal method is not considered a reliable method of contraception on its own, but can be used in addition to other effective methods of contraception and could be used alongside the Natural Cycles app on ‘green’ non-fertile days.\nTalking to a new partner about contraception\nEvery time you have a new sexual partner, it’s a good idea to have a chat about contraception if you don’t want to get pregnant, or contract a sexually transmitted infection (STI). This could be a simple ‘I’m on the [insert chosen method]’, or, ‘we need to use a condom’, before you have sex. If contraception comes up at any point, you could explain more about why you use a particular method over others. Condoms are the only contraceptive that can help to protect you from STIs; so ask when your new partner last had an STI test, and let them know if you’re up to date on screening too. If you’ve communicated that you want to use a condom, and they either refuse, try to talk you out of it, or remove it without your consent – this is an example of reproductive coercion, and a big red flag.\nIf you use FAM or Natural Cycles, this is actually a great talking point. Explain how it works, and the risks of getting pregnant if using FAM , so together you can also make an informed decision about whether you’d like to use additional contraception such as condoms, even if you’re at a non-fertile stage of your cycle when you plan to have sex.\nWhen it comes to new partners, communicating about your sexual needs as well as contraception is key. Don’t be embarrassed to use lube (hormonal contraception can cause vaginal dryness as a side effect), and let them know what you like in bed – no one wants to fake an orgasm. If you have anxiety around sex, including problems reaching orgasm, check out our sex coaching advice service and watch our webinar on sex, libido and orgasms for top tips to help you enjoy sex.\nTalking to a long-term partner about contraception\nIf you’re in a long-term relationship, the conversation around contraception and shared responsibility might need to stretch a bit further than letting them know what method you’re using. Here’s some things to think about…\nChoose a method that suits your lifestyle\nSit down with your partner and have a chat about your life together – what do you get up to day-to-day, and how often do you have sex? If you frequently have sex, are you less likely to want to use a contraceptive you need to remember at the time, or on a daily basis?\nIf you’re often busy, or have an irregular routine, taking the pill or using FAM to track your temperature everyday might not work for you. Remember, no contraceptive is 100% effective, but methods that heavily rely on you using them consistently and effectively leave more room for human error, which you and your partner may want to take into consideration if you are not trying to conceive.\nIf you’re not using any contraception other than condoms and are prone to risk taking in the heat of the moment, this method may also be less effective in the long term. Whether one or both of you hate condoms, or hate having to remember to buy them (and the ongoing cost of using them), there are plenty of long-lasting methods that you may prefer. Check out our guide to non hormonal contraception if you would rather not use hormonal methods.\nExperiencing negative side effects\nWhile hormonal contraception can have many benefits aside from birth control (like helping with painful periods or acne), some people who use hormonal contraception report negative side effects. If you experience mood swings or low sex drive that affects your daily activities or relationship, it’s understandable that you’d want to stop or switch your contraception to find an alternative that works for you. When talking about this with your partner, make sure they really listen to your concerns, and how you feel it could be affecting your relationship. If they’re not happy about switching back to condoms for a while (or permanently) because it ‘doesn’t feel good’, remind them that in 9 months they could have a lot more to worry about.\nIf you’re having trouble finding a method that works for you, try our contraception recommender, or chat to one of our friendly women’s health GPs for advice.\n\nWhether you want to have kids\nIf you’re both on the same page about not wanting kids, or any more than you’ve already got, you may want to consider the two permanent contraception options: the vasectomy or female sterilisation (aka getting your ‘tubes tied’). Names out of a hat to decide who wins? Or, a grown up conversation about who’s willing to have a surgical procedure and the different risks involved, it’s up to you.\nIf permanent contraception doesn’t appeal to either of you, long-acting reversible contraception (LARCS) such as the hormonal coil (IUS) or implant are very reliable ‘set it and forget it’ options that can be removed at any time. The implant is actually even more effective than a vasectomy! If you’re not a fan of hormonal methods, the copper coil (IUD) could be a suitable option.\nGetting pregnant soon after stopping contraception\nThere is evidence to suggest that it can take a while for your fertility to return after using the contraceptive injection over other methods like the pill or coils for example, so this is something to think about if you’re already discussing family planning. Natural Cycles also has a pregnancy planning mode, so if you’re using this method of contraception already you can easily transition into trying to conceive, and then even track the changes happening to your body throughout pregnancy.\nKeeping them in the loop\nYour partner can help to make sure you take your pill, patch or ring at the right time or date to ensure your contraception is as effective as possible. Mark the changeover dates on a shared calendar, ask them to also set a daily pill alarm or give you a gentle nudge if they know you may have forgotten. Keep them in the loop if you’re using it continuously to skip your period, too. The injection has a longer time between top-ups (8-13 weeks depending on the type), but it can’t hurt to let them know when this needs to be done too.\nUsing FAM and Natural Cycles to plan quality time\nGot some non-fertile days coming up? Make plans to have alone time and do some fun activities together, all the better when you know you can enjoy some unprotected sex after! Know when your fertile days are? Then there’s no excuse for them not to have condoms when you see each other, or help keeping your supply well stocked if you live together.\nShared responsibility and Natural Cycles\nWe know lots of you love using Natural Cycles as a way of getting to know your body, so shouldn’t your partner love it for that reason too? If you’re unfamiliar with how it works, our guide to Natural Cycles has the complete lowdown on the app, including everything you need to know about the intuitive algorithm.\nNatural Cycles have launched a ‘Partner View’ feature that allows you to share insights about your cycle with your partner, or anyone else you grant permission to (in case you fancy letting your mum know when you’re fertile). You can choose specific insights that you want to share, if you even want to at all – it’s completely optional. What are the benefits? Well, sharing your Natural Cycles fertility status with your partner so they can clearly see your ‘red’ fertile days and ‘green’ non-fertile days could not only help them to be more in tune with your body, but also make them more conscious of avoiding unnecessary risks if you don’t want to get pregnant (remember what we said earlier about the withdrawal method).\nBut that’s not all. As well as keeping an eye on your fertile and non-fertile days, you can log insights about your period and PMS symptoms, like mood swings, sex drive, cramps and pain, or any other symptoms or illnesses you experience throughout the month. Sharing this with your partner can help them understand exactly how your cycle affects you, not just the science of it all. They can see when you’re anxious, moody or in pain during your period, and check in with you to (hopefully) provide some emergency chocolate, painkillers and quality time!\nShould we split the cost of contraception?\nWhile you can get most contraception for free on the NHS, sometimes you may need or want to buy it elsewhere, especially if you’re in a hurry. When it comes to the morning after pill, there’s no harm in asking them to split the cost – it takes two, after all, and why should it be any different than splitting the cost of dinner on a date? If you’re in a long-term relationship and use condoms, why not take it in turns to buy a box?\nAs Natural Cycles is a digital contraceptive, an annual membership costs £59.99 with a thermometer included, or £8.99 per month (plus a one-off £10 cost for the thermometer). But in the name of shared responsibility, would your partner consider splitting it? Think of it as a shared Netflix subscription for your vagina. If you do want to try out Natural Cycles for yourself, Lowdown readers can receive 15% off an annual subscription and a free thermometer using this link (or the code LOWDOWN15).*\n*FYI – this is an affiliate link, which means The Lowdown will earn a commission on any purchases made.

        "Content": "\n–\n✅ If you think you’ll enjoy this blog, make sure to check out our newsletter for more:\n\nHormones play a big part in our lives: the monthly up and down of our menstrual cycles or the daily tablet-taking of the contraceptive pill. Maybe you have the hormonal coil (IUS) that delivers a small localised dose of progestogen directly to the uterus. Whichever way you look at it, from those early days of puberty through to the hot flushes during menopause, our hormones are front and centre no matter which way you look at it.\nSo when something is amiss and those hormones are out of whack, how does this present itself and what should we look out for? More importantly, how can we settle the stormy seas and get back to a happy hormonal balance? Here’s the lowdown…\nWhat is a hormonal imbalance?\nIf you’ve heard the term hormonal imbalance, you might think it’s a one size fits all diagnosis. But in reality, it is a broad term encompassing a number of conditions. Hormones will naturally fluctuate depending on where you find yourself in your menstrual cycle or if you’re going through the menopause. But there are times when the balance is just plain off and an underlying issue is at play.\nWhat can cause a hormonal imbalance?\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 1 in 10 women. The cause is still a bit of a mystery, but it centres around the hormone levels in the body, most importantly insulin, which helps regulate sugar in the blood. Those with PCOS are often resistant to the effects of insulin. This leads to higher than normal levels of insulin in the blood which causes the ovaries to produce too much testosterone. This also causes imbalances in hormones throughout the menstrual cycle.\nIf you have two or more of the following symptoms, you may have polycystic ovary syndrome:\n\nirregular or no periods\nhigh levels of androgens – sex hormones commonly associated with men (although they are naturally produced by women, just in lower amounts)\npolycystic ovaries – despite what the name suggests, there aren’t actually cysts on your ovaries. Instead, the ovaries are enlarged, and the eggs are surrounded by follicles, which are fluid-filled sacs.\n\nThose suffering with PCOS can experience weight gain, excessive hair growth, hair loss and difficulty conceiving. Irregular periods mean irregular ovulation, and tracking when you are fertile can be tricky. Those with PCOS may also find they do not ovulate at all. Check out our webinar with Professor Colin Duncan, a leading expert on PCOS, where he explains how to get a diagnosis, impact on the body and how to manage it.\n\nHormonal contraception\nHormones used in contraceptives can have androgenic effects. If there are high levels of androgens in the body, it can cause a hormonal imbalance. If you’re worried your contraceptive is having unwanted side effects due to androgens, check out our contraception recommender tool for help finding an alternative.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of a hormonal imbalance?\nWhilst symptoms you’re experiencing may point to a hormonal imbalance, it’s important to look more closely in order to find the root cause. Irregular periods, weight gain, excessive hair growth and vaginal dryness can all be signs something is up with your hormones. But which conditions could be causing your symptoms?\nIrregular periods\nWhilst not necessarily an indicator of a problem, irregular periods can be a sign of a hormonal imbalance. When first starting your period, it can take a few years before they fall into a regular pattern. And even then, it’s perfectly normal to have a few days variation in your cycle length.\nIrregular periods can also be the first sign you are approaching the menopause. This usually starts between the ages of 45 and 55, but can start earlier. This can be due to a natural early menopause – where the ovaries stop producing hormones at the normal level – or through treatment or surgery that brings menopause on prematurely.\nOther causes of irregular periods include:\n\nEarly pregnancy\nHaving a BMI over 30 or extreme weight loss or weight gain\nExcessive exercise\nStress\nSome hormonal contraceptives\n\nCheck out our guide to the COVID-19 vaccine and periods, as it contains more information on what can commonly affect our cycles in day-to-day life. Our contraception comparison tool is also a great way to compare side effects of different methods, including their impact on periods.\nAs we mentioned earlier, PCOS, or polycystic ovary syndrome, can be a cause of irregular periods. Androgens, commonly thought of as male sex hormones, are found in the female body in lower levels. When there are high levels of these hormones in the body, it can give rise to symptoms associated with PCOS, such as excess hair growth and irregular periods.\nAcne\nCommonly associated with puberty, acne is caused by hormone changes – and puberty is full to the brim with those. But acne isn’t exclusively linked with teenagers.\nImbalances of androgen hormones in your body can cause acne in various ways. Glands that sit next to hair follicles on the skin produce a grease-like substance called sebum. If abnormal amounts of sebum are produced, a bacterium called P. acnes causes inflammation. This bacterium usually sits quietly on the skin without causing problems. But when a hormonal imbalance is present, the sebum levels cause the bacterium to wreak havoc. This, alongside the thickening of the inner lining of the hair follicle, results in blocked pores and acne.\nWeight gain\nA symptom commonly seen in those with PCOS is weight gain. On the flip side, if you are overweight or obese, your body will produce higher than average levels of insulin which can help drive PCOS. You see, high levels of insulin cause your body to gain weight. Excess fat tissue, in turn, produces insulin, which makes the problem worse.\nThis is why it is harder to lose weight when you have PCOS, even though it is often the recommended treatment. It can be a source of great frustration for those affected.\nWeight loss and fatigue\nWhen the thyroid is overactive, high levels of triiodothyronine (known as T3) and thyroxine (known as T4) are produced and released into the blood. The increase in production of these thyroid hormones can lead to common symptoms such as weight loss and fatigue. This can be in spite of an increase in appetite. You may also experience mood swings, irritability and anxiety.\nA trip to your local GP surgery can help find the cause, and treatment options – including medication, radioactive iodine treatment, and surgery – can be discussed.\nAn underactive thyroid – hypothyroidism – can also cause tiredness. This is due to the thyroid gland under producing hormones. However, a symptom that distinguishes it from its over-producing thyroid hormone counterpart is weight gain. Other symptoms of hypothyroidism include sensitivity to cold, irregular or heavy periods, and loss of libido.\n\nVaginal dryness\nThe menopause, hormonal contraceptives and breastfeeding are just a few causes of vaginal dryness. Symptoms include sore or uncomfortable sex, pain or itching in or around the vagina, needing to wee more frequently and recurrent UTIs. Check out our blog for more info on how hormonal contraception could be a cause of vaginal dryness.\nExcessive hair\nHirsutism is the name given to excessive hair growth. Thick dark hair can be found on the face, neck, chest, tummy, lower back, bum and thighs and has a link to the levels of hormones in the body called androgens. PCOS is the most common cause of hirsutism.\nHair loss\nWhile hormones can play a part in excessive hair growth, they can also cause hair loss. Female pattern hair loss – or FPHL – is the most common form of hair loss in women. In those with PCOS, FPHL can be due to the rise in androgen levels. There’s also a potential link between contraception and hair loss – yep, another side effect.\nHyperpigmentation of the skin\nHyperpigmentation is the term used to describe darker areas of the skin. Melasma is a type of hyperpigmentation and is thought to be caused by fluctuations in hormone levels. It more commonly affects women than men. Oestrogen and progesterone may cause the production of melanin at higher levels when skin is exposed to the sun. 10-15% of pregnant people will experience melasma as well as 10-25% of people taking oral contraceptives.\nSkin tags\nOften found on the neck and armpits (although they can appear in other areas of the body), skin tags are flaps of skin that can range from just a few millimetres to 5cm wide. They are made of collagen fibres and blood vessels, and they hang from the skin. They are most commonly found in obese or older people, or those with type 2 diabetes. They can also be a symptom of PCOS, as well as hormone changes during pregnancy. An interesting study looked at the link between androgen and oestrogen receptors and skin tags, in which they found a possible link between the two.\nMuscle weakness and joint aches\nA symptom of hypothyroidism, muscle aches and weakness can be caused by an underproduction of thyroid hormones. When coupled with fatigue, patients can experience hypothyroid myopathy. It is a common symptom affecting around 79% of people with an underachieve thyroid. The reason for this is not fully understood, but it is thought the lack of thyroxine (T4) affects the normal functioning in the cell. Fatigue and weakness can impact on normal daily activities, with an increase in severity seen following exercise or activity. However, this can all be reversible with time and treatment. Another great reason to visit your healthcare provider to discuss your symptoms!\nMuscle aches and joint pains are also noted as symptoms of the menopause. And this can be caused by a lack of oestrogen affecting oestrogen receptors in the joints. Oestrogen also works to reduce inflammation, meaning a drop in the hormone increases the risk of osteoarthritis. \nA drop in hormone levels during the menopause can also impact muscle strength. This time, the cause can be testosterone. Hormone replacement therapy – or HRT – can help bring these levels back within the normal range and, as a result, can help with these symptoms.\nHow to treat hormonal imbalance symptoms\nFinding the cause of your symptoms can be crucial to finding a suitable treatment. A lesser known natural treatment option which we love at The Lowdown is starflower oil. Starflower oil is used for easing sore boobs; symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) like mood changes and cramps; as well as minimising hot flushes and anxiety during menopause. It’s an omega-6 fatty acid, and a rich source of gamma-linoleic acid (GLA) which helps reduce inflammation. You can find out more about starflower oil and purchase it straight from The Lowdown via our new shop. Starflower oil can interact with a few medicines, so check this with a pharmacist before giving it a try if you’re currently taking any medication.\nWhen to speak to a doctor\nIf you suspect you have an underlying cause for any of the symptoms we’ve talked about, it’s always worth speaking with your healthcare provider. PCOS diagnosis can involve ultrasounds and blood tests to gain a better picture of the situation, and you may also be referred to a gynaecologist or endocrinologist for treatment. Our doctors are here to help with any questions you have about a hormonal imbalance, it’s so quick and easy to book an appointment at a time that suits you – including evenings and weekends.\n\nLaura Keyes is a freelance content writer living in Cornwall.

        "Content": "\n–\n✅ If you think this blog sound interesting, make sure to check out our newsletter for more:\n\nWhat are the different types of breast pain?\nCyclical breast pain\nSore boobs can be a real pain in the, well, boobs! For some, a tell-tale sign that your period is around the corner, sore breasts are linked to the change in hormone levels prior to your period arriving. This can cause an increased sensitivity in the breast tissue, resulting in pain and tenderness. Once your period arrives, the pain can stop. Until your next period, that is!\nBreast pain that is linked to your cycle is called cyclical pain. This is the most common cause of breast pain and will affect around two in three women.\nSymptoms of cyclical breast pain can include:\n\nburning\nstabbing\nprickling\nheaviness\ntenderness\n\nSore breasts during your period can range from mild to severe, affecting one or both breasts. Pain may also spread down the arm, to the shoulder blade, and along to the armpit. But treatment options are available to buy without the need for a trip to the doctor.\nThose who have experienced the menopause should find that cyclical breast pain stops. But more on that later!\nNon-cyclical breast pain\nThe second type of breast pain is called non-cyclical and is not related to your menstrual cycle. It can therefore appear at any time of the month. The cause is sometimes unclear, but it may be caused by:\n\na breast abscess\nmastitis (an infection usually associated with breastfeeding)\nan injury to the breast\nsome antidepressant drugs\n\nNon-cyclical breast pain can be similar to cyclical, in that it can cause stabbing, burning or a prickling pain and may affect one or both breasts. Non-cyclical pain can come and go or remain constant. In around 50% of those experiencing this type of issue, the pain reduces – or disappears completely – on its own.\nChest pain – sort of\nNow, whilst there are only technically two types of breast pain, it’s worth noting a third. Chest wall pain isn’t actually breast pain, as the source is somewhere else. But it can feel like the pain is in the breast. Causes of this type of pain include angina, a pulled muscle, and inflammation. The pain may be felt in a single area, on only one side, or in a large area of the breast, and can feel sharp or burning. Pain may feel worse when moving or when pressure is applied to the chest wall area.\nWhat can cause breast pain?\nBreasts are very sensitive to changes in hormones, which can happen at different points throughout life due to a number of factors.\nAll different types of contraceptives can cause tender or enlarged breasts. Come to The Lowdown’s homepage and follow: Contraception > Common Side Effects > Tender Breasts/Enlarged Breasts to find out more. \nSore breasts, the pill and pregnancy\nThe contraceptive pill can cause breast tenderness as a side effect, and you might find this an unwanted side effect of your chosen contraceptive method. If you find your pill is causing you pain and you want to try an alternative, our contraceptive comparison tool is a great way to see commonly reported side effects from The Lowdown users.\nAn early sign of pregnancy can include tender breasts. What’s most unhelpful is that many early warning signs of conception can look remarkably similar to PMS symptoms. If you think you might be pregnant, there’s really only one sure-fire way to find out – do a test!\n\nBreastfeeding and boobs\nSore boobs from breastfeeding can put you on the extreme end of the breast pain scale. Breast engorgement can leave your boobs feeling hard and painful. This can happen early on in breastfeeding when it can take a while for mum and baby to get into the flow of supply and demand.\nSore and cracked nipples are as painful as they sound, so speak to your midwife or healthcare provider who can give you tips on the positioning of your baby during feeding.\nMastitis is another cause of breast pain for those who are breastfeeding, caused by a blocked milk duct. As well as a sore, hot boobs, mastitis can cause flu-like symptoms. Carry on breastfeeding, but call your doctor or 111 if symptoms do not improve within 12-24 hours, as you may need antibiotics.\nPerimenopause and the menopause\n\nBetween the ages of 45 and 55 your periods will usually stop, due to a change in hormone levels. This is due to, you guessed it, the menopause. The time before your periods stop, but when you’re experiencing menopausal symptoms, is called perimenopause. During this time, you may experience a number of symptoms including the most commonly known: hot flushes. You can supplement these symptoms by taking Wellwoman multivitamins or Wild magnesium.\nAnother symptom you may experience during menopause is breast pain. The good news is once you’ve gone through the menopause – meaning your last period was over twelve months ago – the breast pain should stop. The bad news, however, is if you’re taking HRT for the treatment of symptoms of the menopause, one of the main side effects is breast tenderness. (A side effect of both oestrogen and progestogen.)\nCheck out our blog on contraception and the menopause for further information on the use of the pill, patch or vaginal ring to help alleviate menopausal symptoms. Another great resource for those going through the menopause is Women’s Health Concern, who offer confidential advice and invaluable information on post-reproductive health.\n\nHow do I relieve sore breasts?\nStarflower oil, which comes from the borage seed, is one of the richest sources of gamma-linolenic acid (GLA). It can be used to help joint aches, skin problems and hormonal imbalances, to name just a few. GLA has also been found to help in the management of breast pain. Studies are unclear as to why this may be the case, but with few side effects, it is a great choice for the treatment of sore breasts. You can buy starflower oil right here from The Lowdown!\nThere are some interactions to be aware of. It is advised not to take starflower oil if you suffer from epilepsy, and talk to your doctor if you take blood thinning tablets as GLA can slow blood clotting, meaning a chance of increased bleeding. If you are pregnant or trying to conceive, give products containing GLA a miss as it can increase the chance of miscarriage. There is an interaction with a few other drugs, so have a quick chat with a doctor or pharmacist before taking starflower oil if you’re on any other meds. Or, speak to one of The Lowdown’s expert women’s health GPs for more advice – especially if you’re suffering from side effects of your contraception.\nAlternative options include ibuprofen and paracetamol, or hormone-suppressing drugs such as danazol and tamoxifen. The latter two come with side effects and can make hormonal contraception less reliable. They also require a prescription, so talk to a GP if you want to consider this option.\nWhen to speak to a doctor about sore breasts\nBreast pain is very common, and as a symptom on its own, is very unlikely to be a sign of cancer. If you experience breast pain, it does not increase your chances of getting breast cancer. However if you notice a lump, or any changes to the skin on your breast or nipple, book an appointment with your healthcare team. \nPain or no pain, it’s always a good idea to get into the habit of checking your breasts monthly, and getting to know your body is a great way to quickly identify anything out of the ordinary. Coppafeel! has a brilliant video on how to check your boobs.\nIt’s also worth seeing the doctor if the pain you’re experiencing doesn’t improve, or if the painkillers you’re taking for the pain just aren’t hitting the spot. Seek medical advice if you have a high temperature, discharge, dimpling, rash, sunken nipple, or your breast is red, hot or swollen.\nAnd if you think you might be pregnant, take a pregnancy test – and book a trip to your GP if two lines appear!\n\nLaura Keyes is a freelance content writer living in Cornwall.

        "Title": "Thrush before, during and after your period – everything you should know",
        "Content": "\nIf you think you’ll find this blog informative make sure to subscribe to our newsletter for more! ✅\n\nPeriods are often inconvenient and uncomfortable, and can come with an annoying mix of symptoms, like bloating, mood swings and cramps. So what we definitely don’t need is a case of thrush to deal with on top of it all. \nBut some people find that they’re actually more prone to developing thrush in the days before, during and after their period – and there’s a good reason for that. Let’s dive into why thrush is more common around your time of the month and what you can do to treat it.\nWhat are the symptoms of thrush?\nSymptoms of thrush include:\n\nUnusual, white, cottage-cheese-like discharge\nBurning or pain while urinating\nPain, itching, redness or swelling of your vulva\nFeeling pain or stinging during sex\n\nSome of the symptoms of thrush are also the symptoms of common STIs; in this article we explain how you can tell the difference and what your treatment options are.\n\nWhy do I get thrush before my period?\nIn order to explain why thrush is more common before your period, we first have to understand what thrush is, and why it occurs in the first place. \nThrush is a fungal infection that thrives in warm, damp places, essentially making the vagina its ideal habitat. It’s caused by a particular fungus called Candida, which is present naturally in the vagina and doesn’t usually cause any problems. Thrush occurs when there’s an overgrowth of Candida in the vagina, which results in those irritating symptoms many of us recognise: itching, soreness and discharge. \nYour vagina is a balanced environment of bacteria and yeast, a vital combination that keeps it healthy and functioning as it should. The reproductive hormones in your body regulate your menstrual cycle; their levels ebb and flow to trigger different events, like the beginning of your period. When your hormones give the signal for the sequence of events before your period to begin, the change in levels of oestrogen can also cause an imbalance in the delicate equilibrium of bacteria and yeast in your vagina. Enter thrush, which research has shown often appears just before our periods. Similarly, combined contraception containing oestrogen like the pill, patch and vaginal ring as well as hormone replacement therapy for menopausal symptoms can be associated with thrush.\n\nWhy do I get thrush during my period?\nLike we said above, the hormones that trigger your period can also cause an imbalance in the bacteria and yeast levels in your vagina. The sanitary products you use during your period can also irritate or damage the delicate skin of the vagina or vulva, which can make you more susceptible to infections like thrush. \nSome people also wash themselves more often or more thoroughly during their period. Your vagina is self-cleaning, and harsh soaps or excess washing can upset the delicate balance of yeast and bacteria, making it easier for a thrush infection to develop. The precise balance of bacteria and yeast in your vagina is important; the yeast stops the bacteria from growing out of control, and the bacteria stops the yeast from doing the same. Cleaning yourself too frequently could be washing away the good bacteria that keep fungal infections in check. \nYou might also have heard about the pH of your vagina playing a role in its overall health (this is something we often see in advertising for intimate washes, for example) – and it’s true, it does. Your vagina naturally has quite an acidic (low) pH, which keeps chances of infection low. Your menstrual blood, on the other hand, has a pH of about 7.4, so can make the pH of your vagina more alkaline (higher) and allow for an easier overgrowth of thrush-causing yeast.\nWhy do I get thrush after my period?\nThrush that develops after your period could be occurring due to the same reasons we mentioned above; hormonal changes around our periods as well as changes in our behaviour – like washing, or using sanitary products – and pH alterations caused by menstrual blood can essentially disrupt the vagina’s normal balance and make thrush more likely to occur.\n\nCan thrush delay or stop a period?\nThe most simple answer is no, thrush itself shouldn’t delay or stop your period. What can happen, however, is for any hormonal changes that may have caused the thrush to occur in the first place to also affect your menstrual cycle. Additionally, being unwell, stressed or run down can increase your likelihood of having thrush and can also affect your period.  \nThat being said, if your period is significantly late (more than a few days) you should take the usual precautions and get yourself a pregnancy test if you’re sexually active. Get a Clearblue test on Amazon (affiliate link). You can also use our missed pill calculator tool if you are unsure:\n\nIf your periods are consistently irregular or you’re worried then speak to your doctor or nurse. \nYou’re also more likely to get thrush if you’re on antibiotics, as they can kill off the good bacteria in your vagina, allowing Candida to grow out of control. Antibiotic use has been associated with periods arriving earlier or later than expected, but this is actually most likely due to other factors, like the stress of being unwell. Other factors that can increase your risk of thrush include diabetes, taking steroids, hypothyroidism (low thyroid hormone levels) and having a condition or taking medicines that suppress your immune system. \n\nHow to treat thrush when on your period\nWhen you’re on your period, you can treat thrush in the same way you would treat it at any other time of the month. Avoid the use of unnecessary and perfumed products around the vulva, you can use a simple moisturiser on the outside of the vulva to wash with if you need. Oral tablets, pessaries and creams are all widely available over the counter from pharmacies, but there are some cases in which a particular treatment option may not be right for you. \nThe most common treatment for thrush is an antifungal tablet, which is taken orally and is effective at treating the infection. It’s usually just one tablet taken once – hurrah! – unless advised differently by your doctor for recurrent thrush. You may experience side effects when taking Flucanozole, the most common being nausea and diarrhoea.\nIf you’re pregnant, you shouldn’t take oral antifungal medications. Those who are pregnant are recommended a medication called Clotrimazole either in the form of a pessary (a tablet that is inserted into the vagina) or a cream that is applied either internally or externally. Buy from Amazon (affiliate link!)\nIf you’re not pregnant you can use Clotrimazole alongside Fluconazole, in its cream or pessary form. If you are using a pessary, do not use any vaginal products (like tampons or menstrual cups) at the same time.\nClotrimazole comes with potential side effects, like any medication. These include swelling, pain or discomfort in or around the vagina, lower abdomen or pelvic pain, vaginal bleeding and stinging or burning after use. Most of the time, these side effects aren’t a problem, and should clear up soon after you finish your treatment. If you are worried, though, be sure to speak to your doctor. \nScreenMe is an innovative test of your vaginal microbiome. ScreenMe is the only UK-based test that can screen for every single bacteria or yeast within your vaginal microbiome. You can always learn more about ScreenMe on our website!\nIf you’re unsure which thrush treatment is right for you, need advice around recurring thrush or even whether you have thrush in the first place – we have a team of wonderful doctors who can go through things with you, too.\n\nMary Hargreaves is a writer and author with a passion for women’s reproductive health.

        "Title": "Contraception and cancer &#8211; what&#8217;s the risk?",
        "Content": "\n–\n✔️ If you think you’ll find this blog informative, make sure to check out our newsletter for more:\n\nIt’s something nobody likes to think about, but cancer can’t be ignored, and it’s important that we’re clued up about our individual risks. Lots of people believe that particular types of contraception increase your risk of cancer, but that might not be entirely true. In fact, some contraceptives might actually protect you against certain types of cancer.\nLet’s dive into different types of contraception and what impact these can have on your risk of developing some types of cancer.\nCombined hormonal contraception\nBreast cancer \nCombined contraceptive methods contain both oestrogen and progestogen. The most common combined contraceptive method is the combined pill. Microgynon, Cilest and Yasmin are all popular brands of the combined contraceptive pill. The patch and the vaginal ring are also combined contraceptive methods.\nWe’ve known for some time that the combined pill slightly increases your risk of developing breast cancer. Breast cancer is rare in younger women who are users of contraception so the increase in risk with the combined pill is therefore very small. A 2023 study¹ found that for every 100,000 women who are aged 35-39, 265 more women who have been using oral contraceptives, so combined or progestogen-only pills, for 5 years could develop breast cancer in the next 10 to 15 years. The risk is smaller in younger women suggesting an extra 61 women per 100 000 aged 25 to 29 years old and an extra 8 women per 100,000 aged 16 to 25 years old will develop breast cancer.  \nIt’s important to point out that your risk of developing breast cancer is also dependent on factors other than your contraception. Whether or not you smoke, your weight and your genes all play a role. So let’s put this into perspective: there are almost 56,000 cases of breast cancer each year in the UK of which 8% are caused by obesity and being overweight and another 8% are caused by drinking alcohol. Less than 1% are caused by oral contraceptives.²\n\nThe slightly elevated risk of breast cancer reduces once you stop taking the pill, and ten years after stopping, your risk will be back to normal.¹\nOne study³ also found that the amounts and types of oestrogen and progestogen in your combined contraception can affect your risk of developing breast cancer, but there isn’t enough research to expand on this just yet. \nJust a note… If you have a family history of breast cancer, or know that you have a faulty BRCA gene, you should speak to your doctor before beginning combined contraception. This is because you might already be at a higher risk of developing breast cancer. Everyone has BRCA genes, which protect us against breast and ovarian cancers. Some people have a faulty BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene, meaning this protective effect doesn’t work as it should. \nOvarian cancer\nEvery time we ovulate, our ovaries are slightly damaged. Damage to the ovaries, over time, can cause ovarian cancer in some cases. When we take hormonal contraception, which stops ovulation and prevents this damage from occurring, this can reduce the risk of developing ovarian cancer. \nA huge study in Denmark⁴  which looked at nearly two million women over a nineteen year period found that any combined hormonal contraception – like the pill, ring and patch – provided a significant protective effect against ovarian cancer. This effect was more pronounced the longer a woman had been taking her contraception, and reduced once she stopped. \nOther studies⁵ have found a benefit of decreased risk of ovarian cancer for many years after stopping hormonal contraception, and that this gradually reduces over time. \nEndometrial Cancer\nEndometrial cancer is cancer of the lining of the womb. Users of the combined pill have been found to have half the risk of developing endometrial cancer than those who have never used hormonal contraception, and this protective effect is the highest if you are currently taking combined contraception.⁵ People who recently stopped taking combined contraception still have a reduced risk, and this will slowly decrease the longer it is since stopping. \nThe protective effect against endometrial cancer has also been found across all combined contraception types,⁶ and it is thought that this protection could last up to twenty years after stopping contraception in some cases.\nBowel Cancer\nA study followed 46,000 women to monitor the long term impact of taking the combined contraceptive pill.⁵ The study found that taking the pill for any length of time lowered the cases of bowel cancer.\nProgestogen-only contraception\nBreast cancer\nUnlike combined contraceptive methods, progestogen-only contraception contains no oestrogen – just progestogen. The mini pill is a form of progestogen-only contraception, and brands like Micronor, Noriday and Cerazette are popular in the UK. The implant and the injection and the hormonal coil (aka hormonal IUD or IUS) are also forms of progestogen-only contraception.\nThe research into breast cancer and progestogen-only contraception has been inconsistent and often looked at all hormonal methods, grouping progestogen-only and combined contraception together. This made it really tricky to definitively say whether or not progestogen-only methods affect breast cancer risk.\nHowever a study published in 2023 looked at nearly 30,000 patient records held by GPs in the UK, including almost 10,000 women under 50 years old who had breast cancer diagnosed between 1996 to 2017.¹ The study revealed that similarly to the combined pill, current or recent users of the progestogen only contraceptives were found to be at slightly increased risk of breast cancer. There was no significant difference between the types of progestogen-only methods and their effects on breast cancer. We discuss this new study more in our blog on progestogen-only contraception and breast cancer.  \nCurrently, unlike combined methods, progestogen-only methods are generally considered safe for people with a BRCA gene mutation to use. Someone with current breast cancer, and most people with a history of breast cancer, should not use any form of hormonal contraception.⁷\nOvarian cancer\nThe Danish study didn’t find any protective effects of progestogen-only contraception, but there are others that have. Using the hormonal coil has been associated with reduced cases of ovarian cancer,⁸ as has the injection,⁹ both of which are progestogen-only methods. \nIt is possible that inconsistencies in the research for progestogen-only contraception are because of the way certain progestogen-only contraceptives work. While most hormonal contraception works to suppress ovulation on some level, some progestogen-only contraceptives do so more than others. It could be that those that suppress ovulation less (like the hormonal coil, which tends to prevent pregnancy by thinning the lining of the womb and thickening the cervical fluid at the neck of the womb) see less consistent protective effects in the research.\nEndometrial cancer\nResearch into the effects of progestogen-only contraceptive methods on endometrial cancer risk is less common, but does suggest that these methods provide similar protection against the disease.⁶\nResearch that looked at all oral contraceptives and found a significant protective effect against endometrial cancer.¹⁰\nThe Mirena, Levosert and Benilexa brands of hormonal coil, are also licensed for use to protect the womb lining from the effects of oestrogen used in hormonal replacement therapy for menopausal symptoms.¹⁵ This is because if oestrogen is used to treat menopausal symptoms without progestogen, this will cause the womb lining to grow, risking cancerous changes. \nPeople who have infrequent periods (less than every three months) because of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) can use contraceptive options such as the combined pill or hormonal coil (IUS) to keep the lining of the womb thin and reduce their risk of cancerous changes.\nBowel cancer\nResearchers have looked at all oral contraceptives together rather than progestogen-only pill alone, but have found a significant protective effect against bowel cancer (a reduction of 14-19%).¹¹\nHormonal contraception and cervical cancer\nThere is evidence that long-term use of both the combined and mini pill can increase your risk of cervical cancer by up to four times.¹² This risk increases the longer you are taking your contraception, with people who have been using hormonal contraception for five years or more having the greatest risk.¹² ¹³\nFor around 10% of women in the UK who develop cervical cancer, this is linked to oral contraceptive use.¹³ This might sound alarming, but there is also evidence that this risk diminishes once you stop taking hormonal contraception, and to put it into perspective, less than 1% of UK women develop cervical cancer during their lifetime.¹³ This number includes those who are taking hormonal contraception and those who are not.\nIt’s difficult to say whether particular types of hormonal contraception, like the vaginal ring, injection, patch and implant, have a lesser or greater effect on your risk of developing cervical cancer. More research is needed in this area. \nIt’s also important to remember that your risk of developing cervical cancer, whether you use the pill or not, is extremely low if you do not have human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV is common, and usually goes away on its own and doesn’t cause any problems – most people won’t even know they have had it. Keeping up to date with your cervical screening, getting vaccinated against HPV if you are eligible, and using condoms are great ways to protect yourself from HPV and from any greater risk of cervical cancer that it may cause.\nNon-hormonal methods\nThere is evidence that users of the copper coil have reduced rates of cervical cancer and  reduced rates of endometrial cancer.¹⁴\nThis blog can help you learn more about various contraception options, but it does not give medical advice. You should always speak to a nurse or doctor when making choices about contraception and before starting a new method.\nOne of The Lowdown’s fab Clinical Directors, Dr Melanie Davis-Hall BMBS (Hons) BMedSci (Hons) DFSRH MRCGP is a GP and a clinical editor for the British Medical Journal.

        "Title": "A doctor’s experience of sexual health in rural South African communities",
        "Content": "\nPicture this: you’re fifteen years old. You haven’t had a period for five months. It only started two years ago so you aren’t sure of your ‘normal’ yet but five months seems too long. You’re unsure what a menstrual cycle is, what to expect, what it all means for your body.\nYour family and school have definitely neglected, no, refused to inform you of how your own body works because you’re a teenager and live in a rural, conservative farming community. You shouldn’t know what sex is, never mind the implications of it. You go to the local hospital to see if you’re broken or dying. It turns out you’re 23 weeks pregnant. The doctor gives you a judgmental look and wonders how you possibly couldn’t have known that you were more than halfway through a pregnancy. You didn’t know, because no one told you.\nYou’re told by the doctor that you can’t legally have an abortion. “We could have offered you one 3 weeks ago. Why did you wait so long?” You become a mother to a child, as a child, and your family is thrilled because this means they can prove you’re fertile and marry you off well for a large lobola* to your child’s father who happens to be 23. Although traditionally acceptable, this is statutory rape and illegal. You didn’t know, because no one told you.\nYou don’t go back to school because your teachers are sure you’ll be a bad influence towards the other girls so you stay at home, get a child support grant each month, and have a baby every other year until you turn 22 and the doctor at your antenatal visit asks in horror how you could possibly have five children at your age when there are so many contraceptive choices available. You didn’t know, because no one told you.\nMy experience as a doctor\nI can’t tell you how many young women’s lives could’ve been different if at any point someone had just told them, spoken to them, informed them of what their bodies were capable of and how science could help them. For a year I worked in a small rural community in KwaZulu Natal, South Africa and witnessed first-hand how vastly different my experience as a woman had been, and is, compared to most of my patients living there.\nI was educated, independent and fully empowered to do with my body as I pleased. They were not. I found so much of my time at work, which so often was as exhausting as it was fulfilling, was spent with women. Women as patients, mothers, caretakers and colleagues. Women who I was horrified to learn were so fundamentally similar but could not be further from me and my life.\nTraditional old wives tales, social systems of a terrible past, short staffing in clinics and the abomination that was sex education at schools lead to the inevitable: unplanned babies. Babies who, if female, would likely fall into the same cyclical tragedy of life in a developing country during the twenty first century.\nThis blew my mind. It still does. We know so much and do so much in the world of sexual health with an amazing movement towards de-stigmatising the entire subject and yet, for so many, access to a pill that was developed and distributed in the 1960s is for all intent and purpose, out of reach. This, as with so many complex issues in the world, is multifactorial. Fix one thing and another problem will rear its head and ensure that you end up back at square one.\nInequality and access to contraception\nDuring the apartheid regime in South Africa the only form of contraception available to black women was the injection. A three monthly hormone based injection given regularly at the clinic. Post-1994 South Africa ensured that this was no longer the case, however when the only method of contraception the women in your family have ever tried is the injection, it stands to reason that the only form you’ll try and trust would be the same. Right?\nThis has turned out to plague any and all contraceptive drives since in South Africa. The injection is horribly impractical in South African and most developing world contexts. There is significant stigma surrounding having to go to the hospital with comments like ‘do you have HIV?’, ‘can we catch whatever illness you have?’, ‘oh my gosh- she’s pregnant!’, ‘she must be going to get contraception. Tut tut…’, amongst others, which would circulate regularly as the town gossip. With the vast distance our patients had to travel and the poor health seeking nature of most communities, it’s no surprise that the injection was not an effective form of contraception in these communities, simply because it wasn’t being used properly.\nOral contraceptive pills, intrauterine devices (aka IUDs or coils) and implants have since been pushed into the health sector with great velocity and minimal uptake. Antenatal clinics (where you see a doctor or midwife during your pregnancy) are now ironically the best spots for contraceptive counselling, proving that while prevention is better than cure, we just can’t catch every patient in time. At least, we can reduce the chance of further unplanned pregnancies. In the same vain, high schools remain the single most volatile places to be ‘pro-choice’ (on any subject pertaining to sex) and the departments of health and education still haven’t decided who’s responsibility it is to implement sexual and basic health education in the classroom. So it remains undone.\nLuckily, we’re given a huge amount of information on health, sex and contraception in the UK from a very early age. The Lowdown, for instance, is one of the most informative and open platforms I’ve seen and I’m thrilled that you’ve found this piece here. Please use The Lowdown, your GP, or local clinic, to find out as much information about YOU and your options as you can. Talk to your best friend, parents or partner. Find your normal and listen to your body. Then use the incredible science of medicine to make it work for you and with you, to be the best you.\nI’m sure you can pick up the frustration I feel and felt working in a space so opposed to the forward trajectory of women’s health (and rights) but I’m not writing this to have a good whinge and moan about my people, my home or my job. I’m writing this so you know, because someone told you.\n*lobola- Zulu, Swazi, Xhosa, Silozi and northern and southern Ndebele, sometimes referred to as “bride wealth” is property in livestock or kind, which a prospective husband or head of his family undertakes to give to the head of a prospective wife’s family in gratitude of letting the husband marry their daughter.\nbr>\nDr Brenna Weaver MBChB (WITS) is a South African trained doctor, who became passionate about women’s health whilst working in under-resourced, rural communities, doing everything from Caesarean sections to contraceptive drives.",

        "Title": "Why you should use lubricant",
        "Content": "\n–\n✅ If you think you’ll enjoy this blog, make sure to check out our newsletter for more:\n\nIn an ideal world, our vaginas would lubricate themselves adequately every time we need them to. We never experience uncomfortable friction, or wonder why, during sex, they aren’t acting as turned on as we’re feeling in our heads. Unfortunately, this isn’t an ideal world.\nVaginal dryness, whether it happens once or twice, only in certain situations or most of the time, isn’t fun. Luckily, though, lubricant exists, and it’s remarkably effective. In a study of more than 2,000 women, it was found that lube increased pleasure for solo sex, penile-vaginal sex and penile-anal sex – whether they suffered from vaginal dryness or not. \nEveryone with a vagina produces varying levels of natural lubricant, so there’s no ‘normal’ here. Using lube is relatively common and can have loads of benefits for your sex life and your health, even if you don’t suffer from vaginal dryness. In fact, lots of people use lubricant to enhance their sex lives regardless of their natural lubricant levels  – it’s a personal choice, and definitely nothing to be ashamed of!\nWhat does lubricant do?\nIn the broadest possible terms, lubricant facilitates the movement of one object against another. During sex – be it solo, vaginal or anal – lube is used to decrease uncomfortable friction between one body part and another (or between a body part and a sex toy), with the aim of improving pleasure and decreasing discomfort.\nWhat can lubricant be used for?\nVaginal dryness\nVaginal dryness can happen at any age, and is an umbrella term that refers to inadequate natural lubrication, from reasons ranging from a lack of sexual arousal to hormonal changes due to the menopause. \nSome may find that they experience vaginal dryness only occasionally, which is totally normal, while for others it might be a more constant problem. It can cause pain during sex, soreness and itchiness, and can increase your risk of developing a urinary tract infection. A good lubricant can mitigate the risks of these problems occurring as a result of solo or partnered sex.\nImproving pleasure\nStudies show that women enjoy sex more when it is ‘wet’ rather than dry, and feel that it is easier to achieve orgasm when sex is wetter. The purpose of a lubricant during sexual activity is to increase wetness, and this has positive implications for your overall pleasure.\nReducing pain and discomfort\nVaginal dryness can occur for a multitude of reasons, but it commonly occurs during the menopause, or alongside conditions like atrophic vaginitis. If the vagina is not properly lubricated during sex, it can be painful and sore, and for anyone experiencing vaginal dryness, their own natural lubrication may not cut it.\nLubricant can act in place of the vagina’s natural lubrication, creating less friction and, as a result, less soreness and discomfort. \nReducing friction with condoms\nMost condoms come with a small amount of lubricant already on them, but this isn’t always sufficient. A condom is made of a thin layer of plastic, which actually creates more friction than bare skin does, meaning the uncomfortable effects of inadequate lubrication might be more prominent. \nLots of people find that they need to use additional lubricant when using condoms, as the lubricant the condom comes with just isn’t enough.\nDoes lubricant have side effects?\nThere are a few different types of lubricant: water-based, oil-based and silicone-based. While no one type of lube causes ‘side effects’ per se, there are some things you should watch out for. Oil-based and silicone-based lubricants are long-lasting and harder to wash off, which makes them great for use in the shower, but means you’ll have to use soap to properly remove them. Soap can be irritating to the delicate skin of the vulva and vagina, and can cause itching or soreness (so be wary of intimate washes). By the same logic, oil-based and silicone-based lubricants are also harder to wash out of clothing and bedding, so watch where you spill! \nBoth oil-based and silicone-based lubricants last a long time, and don’t generally need reapplying too often. Oil-based lubes, though, can interact with the latex in latex condoms, damaging them and rendering them ineffective. So it’s really important that you don’t use the two products together. Silicone-based lubricants can interact with silicone in some sex toys too, causing them to degenerate over time. \nWater-based lubricants, on the other hand, wash off easily and don’t interact with condoms or sex toys. This means that they don’t last as long – so you might need to reapply – and they won’t be too effective in the shower, but they’re great for anyone with sensitive skin. They also don’t interact with the latex in condoms or the silicone in sex toys, so they’re a brilliant all-rounder.\nGet Yes Organics lube from Amazon!

        "Title": "What are the causes of thrush?",
        "Content": "\n✅ If you think you’ll enjoy this blog, make sure to check out our newsletter:\n\nThrush is caused by an overgrowth of a yeast called candida. It is an infection that thrives in moist, damp places (hello, vagina), and is usually harmless. You can develop thrush in your mouth, armpits, groin and even between your fingers. The vagina is an ideal location for thrush to thrive, and is one of the most common places the infection is found.\nWhat is vaginal thrush?\nTo understand exactly what vaginal thrush is, we first need to understand the delicate ecosystem of the vagina itself. Our vaginas contain both bacteria and yeast, and when they’re at the right levels, they keep each other in check and maintain a perfect balance. The yeast stops the bacteria from overgrowing, and the bacteria does the same to the yeast. When something upsets this balance – and we’ll get into the culprits in a second – candida (the yeast that causes thrush) has an opportunity to thrive. \nExcess amounts of candida are what cause the symptoms of thrush, like:\n\nUnusual, white, cottage cheese-like discharge\nBurning or pain on the vulval area while urinating\nPain, itching, redness or swelling of your genitals\nDiscomfort or stinging to the vulval skin during sex\nThrush discharge does not usually have an unpleasant smell like you might find with bacterial vaginosis\n\nYour vagina naturally has quite an acidic pH as a result of the balance of its natural ecosystem of bacteria and yeast. If this pH is altered, it can make it easier for candida or thrush to overgrow. \nWhat are the causes of vaginal thrush?\nThere are many things that can tip the metaphorical bacteria-yeast scale in your vagina and cause a bout of thrush. Before we get into the most common causes, it’s important to note that thrush isn’t classed as an STI, but can be shared between sexual partners and it can be triggered by sex. This is because, during vaginal sex, the equilibrium we talked about before can be thrown off balance by pH changes due to semen, lubricants and condoms. \nDamaged or irritated skin\nIf the skin around your vagina is irritated or damaged, you are more likely to develop thrush. This is because thrush grows more easily on damaged skin, where it can live under the surface. Be sure not to use soaps or perfumes on vulval skin, as these can cause further damage.  Intimate washes may sell themselves as being good for vaginal health but actually can cause more harm than good.\nWe have a great team of doctors here at The Lowdown who can give you tailored advice about thrush in a one-to-one consultation.\nAntibiotics\nCandida is a yeast fungus, not a bacterial infection, so antibiotics won’t work to get rid of it. In fact, quite the opposite: you are more likely to develop thrush if you are taking antibiotics. Antibiotics work by killing off the good bacteria. Can you guess what’s coming next? Your vagina relies on certain good bacteria to keep its amount of yeast fungus in check – it all circles back to that delicate equilibrium between bacteria and yeast. The death of these good bacteria can allow space for candida to grow out of control.\nDiabetes\nIf you have diabetes, you might find that you develop vaginal thrush more easily. This is because candida thrives on sugar, and there is more sugar in your blood if you are diabetic than if you are not. The sugar in your blood also makes its way into your urine, sweat and saliva, making your body more prone to a thrush infection. The better controlled your diabetes, the less likely you are to get thrush infections.\nWeakened Immune System\nThere are many reasons why someone might have a weakened immune system. Genetic disorders, certain medications and cancer treatment can all reduce the efficacy of the immune system, making it harder to fight off infections and making thrush more likely to take hold.\nIf you have a weakened immune system, your immune cells won’t fight off thrush as effectively as they might otherwise. This can cause thrush to spread to other areas of your body, and can be quite dangerous. If you know you have a weakened immune system and the thrush treatments you have tried aren’t working, make sure to see your doctor. \nHormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)\nStudies have shown that postmenopausal women on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) are more likely to develop thrush than those who are not on hormone replacement therapy. This is because oestrogen (a key component of HRT) causes cells to produce glycogen (a stored sugar), which can, in turn, cause candida to overgrow.\nThe menstrual cycle and contraception\nThe natural hormonal changes you experience during your cycle can lead to imbalances in the vagina. That’s why you’re more likely to develop thrush around your period. Specifically, it’s high levels of oestrogen which seem to increase the risk of thrush.\nThe hormones found in contraception are artificial versions of the hormones found in your own body, but synthetic oestrogen can still cause the balance of bacteria and yeast in your vagina to become, well, unbalanced and itchy. Check out our blog about how contraception might lead to vulval itching.\n\nCan the coil cause thrush?\nThere is conflicting research about whether coils can cause thrush. Some studies show that there is an association between coils and thrush, others have found no link whatsoever. There is a theory that thrush yeasts can stick to coils inside the womb making it harder for treatments to fully work, and therefore increasing the risk of recurrent thrush. While the evidence isn’t compelling, guidelines do suggest that recurrent, symptomatic thrush that isn’t responding to treatment in those who have a coil, could benefit from a switch of contraception. If this affects you, why not use our contraception recommender to find a better option?\nPregnancy\nIn the same hormonal vein, pregnancy also increases your likelihood of developing thrush. When you’re pregnant, the levels of oestrogen and progesterone in your body change, which can cause the levels of bacteria and yeast in your vagina to change, too. The levels of oestrogen in your body in particular can have an impact, as it can make your cells more susceptible to the growth of glycogen (a stored sugar), which can increase candida growth. \nIf you are pregnant, you should speak to your healthcare provider before you use thrush treatment, as some will not be suitable for you.\n\nWhen to see a doctor about thrush\nYou should seek medical advice if:\n\nYour thrush doesn’t go away with the appropriate treatment, or if it keeps coming back.\nIf you are pregnant, or have a weakened immune system, and suspect you have thrush.\nIf your thrush appears to be spreading, or getting worse despite treatment. \n\nThrush doesn’t usually lead to ulcers, smelly discharge, bleeding, pelvic pain or deep pain during sex. If you have these symptoms then contact your local sexual health clinic ASAP.\nHow to treat the symptoms of thrush\nThe good news is that thrush is pretty common, rarely serious and generally easy to treat. You can treat thrush using an oral tablet, a pessary (a tablet you put inside your vagina) or a cream. like Canesten on Amazon (affiliate link btw!)\nMost people can use oral antifungal medication alongside a cream or pessary, which may help to relieve the irritating symptoms of thrush, like itching and discomfort. If you are pregnant, you should not take oral Fluconazole capsules, and should speak to a doctor or healthcare provider before beginning thrush treatment, usually with vaginal pessaries.\nIf you have a regular sexual partner, it is worth checking whether they have noticed any itching or redness to their bits. They should be treated too if they have any symptoms.\nIf you’re still not sure which treatment might help you, book a consultation with one of our lovely doctors. They’ll be able to talk you through your options and help you find a solution that’s right for you.\n\nMary Hargreaves is a writer and author with a passion for women’s reproductive health.

        "Title": "Why do I keep getting UTIs?",
        "Content": "\n–\n👀 If you think you’ll find this blog interesting, make sure to check out our newsletter for more:\n\nWhy do I keep getting UTIs?\nUTIs are extremely common, with statistics showing from 33% to 60% of women experiencing one across their lifetime. Whilst some individuals may experience a one-off infection, for some, recurrent UTIs (rUTIs) are a painful reality.\nUTIs are considered recurrent if there are 3 positive urine cultures during a 12 month period or 2 infections during the previous 6 months. In the case of recurrent UTIs, it is usually the same bacteria that is causing the repeat of the infection.  \nThere are a range of factors that can cause some people to get UTIs over and over again. These can vary hugely, with everything from anatomical differences to an array of lifestyle related reasons, such as using spermicide coated condoms or not drinking enough water! Genetic factors might also have an impact, so if your Mum or other close relatives suffer from them, chances are you might too,\nWe are going to jump right in and have a closer look at some of the causes and how you can try to minimise the recurrence of infection.\nHygiene and Lifestyle\nTo minimise recurring UTIs, there are some measures that relate to hygiene and lifestyle practices that may prove to be beneficial:\n\nAlways wipe from front to back (to reduce the chance that harmful bacteria can enter the urinary tract from the bowel)\nDrink plenty of water\nDon’t hold in your wee for too long – empty your bladder when you need to\nTry not to use cosmetic bath products, especially scented ones (bath oils, vaginal creams or lotions) or feminine ‘hygiene’ washes and douches \n\nSexual Activity\nHaving frequent sex can be one of the greatest risk factors for recurrent UTIs. This risk can be increased by the use of spermicides for contraception too. Studies have shown that there is a up to 4x increase of risk of a UTI on the second day after having sex.\nIt has been suggested that washing your bits before and after sex (and that of your partners too), could reduce the likelihood of a UTI, as it reduces the amount of bacteria that could travel into the urinary tract. Although there is mixed evidence about peeing after sex, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), recommends it as a way to reduce risk of UTIs. There is also a recommendation for those with rUTIs not to use a vaginal diaphragm or spermicide, as it can cause irritation.\nHealth Issues\nCertain health issues can make it more likely that you’ll experience UTIs. Associated conditions include:\n\nMenopause: Hormonal changes around menopause can lead to more UTIs as well as things like vaginal dryness\nGenital Prolapse: This can increase the incidence as it can be more difficult to empty the bladder, which is a risk factor for UTI\nNeurological bladder dysfunction: Associated conditions include Parkinson’s disease, strokes, spinal cord injury, diabetes and multiple sclerosis. This is because conditions that affect the nerves, can also damage the nerves in the bladder, which can impact the bladder’s ability to fill and empty\nUrinary incontinence: This is rooted in problems with the muscles within the bladder and pelvic floor\n\nGenetic Causes\nGenes can play a part in whether we are affected by rUTIs or not, because our genetic make-up is responsible for how our immune system reacts to bacteria in the body. Research has shown that UTIs do run in families, with one study concluding that 42% of family members were prone to a UTIs compared to an 11% likelihood when there was no family history of infection. This risk further increased if the relation was a mother, daughter or sister – so perhaps now is the cue to have some slightly awkward bladder related dinner table conversation! \nLooking to the future, the unique genetic factors that seem to make some individuals’ more prone to UTIs does mean that the treatment options of tomorrow may be more targeted towards specific genes and therefore more effective.\n\nIs there a link between recurrent UTIs and cancer?\nThe research is slightly mixed, but some studies suggest that recurrent UTIs could be a risk factor for genitourinary cancers (e.g. bladder and kidney cancers). A potential factor is because women and people with uteruses who have bladder or kidney cancer may lose out on a diagnosis because they are being treated for UTIs (which can have some overlapping symptoms).\nThis is in no way meant to be a terrifying message, but trying to practice the different lifestyle and hygiene measures that can help to reduce re-infection is a proactive way to minimise chances of anything more serious going on. Also, if you do notice symptoms such as blood in your urine or any changes and you have concerns, definitely speak to your medical team for reassurance! \nWhat are the treatments for recurrent UTIs?\nSome people may choose to take a continuous dose of antibiotics to treat UTIs, usually when other measures have failed to control the recurrence. In these cases, a low dose of antibiotics can be taken for periods of 6 months or longer. There can be a range of dosage frequencies e.g. taking antibiotics every three nights or on alternative nights. \nWhilst being on continuous antibiotics seems to reduce the rate of UTIs, they don’t completely reduce the risk of contracting an infection. Taking antibiotics repeatedly can disrupt the helpful bacteria in the gut which can affect our general immune system, which may in turn increase the likelihood of a UTI.\nDo all UTIs need antibiotics?\nUTIs can be ‘self resolving’, so in some cases may clear up spontaneously and without any medical intervention. Keep reading for some tips on clearing cystitis.\nHowever, without treatment, nearly half of those who have a self-resolving UTI go on to develop a recurrent UTI within the first year. It is estimated from trials that when no treatment is administered, the rate of recurrence is approximately 2 to 3 cases per patient year. \nIf you are pregnant and have symptoms of UTI then please contact a healthcare professional, as this does need urgent antibiotic treatment to prevent complications.\nDo the chances of getting a UTI increase when you’ve already had one?  \nIf you experience one UTI there’s an approximately 20% chance of suffering from another. Of that amount, a further 30% will have yet another. And (if you’re still with me on this), of that last group, another 80% will have recurrences. So yes, there does seem to be a connection where one UTI leads to another!\nWhen to see a doctor about recurrent UTIs\nAccording to the NHS, the recommendation is to see your GP if:\n\nYou’re pregnant with the symptoms of a UTI\nYour symptoms get worse or show not improvement within 2 days\nYour symptoms have come back despite treatment\n\nThere are ways to manage recurrent UTIs so it is really important that the reasons for the recurrence are fully investigated so that treatments can be put in place. \nHow to treat and prevent future UTIs\nAside from some of the lifestyle measures mentioned above there are different options for managing UTIs including:\n\nA short course of antibiotics\nCranberry capsules or juices: some studies show that cranberry can stop harmful bacteria in the bladder\nPotassium citrate: said to change the pH of the urine which can reduces symptoms such as pain when going to the toilet\nProbiotics: can be beneficial in preventing recurrence by increasing helpful bacteria populations which can have positive effects particularly in preventing UTIs \nD-mannose: which stops harmful bacteria attaching to the bladder and causing infection. We have loads more information about using D-mannose as treatment for UTIs, and you can buy D-mannose directly from The Lowdown.\n\nOther than antibiotics, some of the treatments above require further research. The information we have at present is particularly encouraging for D-mannose, which has even shown greater success than antibiotics at treatment and prevention of UTIs in research! If you suffer from pelvic pain from rUTIs, our pelvic health physio can talk you through simple, effective strategies to manage your condition.\n\n\n\n\nEmma is a Pharmacology & Physiology graduate with a huge passion for women’s health.

        "Title": "Why is my vagina dry?",
        "Content": "\n–\nAs vulva and vagina owners, most of us are used to having something or other coming out of us at any given time – blood, coils, babies, discharges of a variety of sight, smell and colour… the list goes on. But at the opposite end of the spectrum about 20% of pre-menopausal women in the UK suffer from vaginal dryness.\nYour vagina relies on a variety of factors including hormonal and bacterial harmony to be at its best! Arguably, the most important of these is oestrogen, the get up and GLOW hormone that makes you look and feel great, and has similar effects on your vagina. Oestrogen assists with keeping the lining of the vagina elastic, thick and well lubricated. All the boxes we’d like ticked! \nCauses of Vaginal Dryness\nHormones & Ageing\nOnce the process of menopause begins, our production of oestrogen naturally (and annoyingly) drops, often along with progesterone, which is why more than 30% of menopausal and post-menopausal women in the UK complain of vaginal dryness.  However, the real statistics may be even higher as symptoms such as pain during sex and vaginal itching tend to be under-reported.\nVaginal dryness is often a symptom of vaginal atrophy or atrophic vaginitis, which more recently has been termed ‘genitourinary syndrome of the menopause’. This is where due to age related oestrogen changes, the lining of the vagina becomes thin, dry and inflamed, causing a variety of symptoms related to the vulva, vagina and urinary tract. Studies have shown this affects around a whopping 70% of postmenopausal women. Often vaginal atrophy and vaginal dryness are used synonymously. \nHormones & Childbirth\nChildbirth and breastfeeding can also drop your oestrogen levels due to the differing demands and requirements of your body and newly born baby. Oestrogen levels steadily increase throughout pregnancy and rapidly drop once your baby is born. The hormones responsible for breast milk production then increase in peaks and troughs for production to be maintained if needed over your baby’s first few years of life. These hormones (oxytocin and prolactin) keep your oestrogen levels suppressed which may lead to symptoms such as vaginal dryness, but also prevent your menstrual cycle from bouncing back immediately after delivery (which is why breastfeeding can be used as a contraceptive method). \nContraception\nHormonal contraception (containing oestrogen and/or progestogen such as the combined oral contraceptive pill could also affect vaginal lubrication, potentially leading to vaginal itching or yeast infections. If this is the case for you, there are alternative options available which may be less likely to cause this side effect or don’t contain any hormones at all. We recommend comparing contraception methods to find your fit! \n\nMedical treatments and conditions\nIf you’ve had chemotherapy or radiation treatment this can affect how much hormone your ovaries are producing as these types of life saving treatments often knock-out part, and sometimes all, of the functionality of surrounding structures. This can range from mild changes to ovarian insufficiency and early menopause. Similarly if your ovaries have been removed you’ll have a lower oestrogen supply and a higher chance of vaginal dryness. \nMedications used to stop the production of oestrogen (for example used to decrease fibroid size or help with symptoms of endometriosis) can lead to unwanted vaginal dryness. Allergy and cold medication (such as antihistamines and decongestants) can dry you up better than expected (or wanted!) in areas you certainly weren’t expecting and some antidepressants have also been found to have a side effect of vaginal dryness too.\nAutoimmune conditions such as Sjogren’s syndrome and diabetes can also cause you to have vaginal dryness. Sjogren’s syndrome causes glandular swelling and malfunction leading to a dry mouth, dry eyes and, you guessed it, dry vagina. In the case of diabetes, vascular damage due to elevated blood sugar levels can cause an array of complications and unfortunately the blood vessels supplying the vagina aren’t spared. This decreased blood flow to the vagina in turn may decrease lubrication. Other conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis and stress can be associated with vaginal dryness.\nVaginal ‘hygiene’ products\nSo-called ‘vaginal hygiene’ practices (that are definitely not recommended), such as douching, may also upset the delicate balance that is the vaginal microbiome, the good bacteria that keep the vagina healthy. This could lead to dryness and discharge and mean you’re more susceptible to pH and bacterial imbalances, and possibly infections.\nScreenMe is an innovative test of your vaginal microbiome. ScreenMe is the only UK-based test that can screen for every single bacteria or yeast within your vaginal microbiome. Following a test, ScreenMe offers follow up 1:1 consultations to explain the results and support you.\nSymptoms of Vaginal Dryness\nOkay, so we know oestrogen is important and that there are many ways it can be affected but how do you know if you have vaginal dryness?\nSymptoms include:\n\nFeeling itchy around your vulva: The skin and tissue here is one of the most sensitive areas of our body. Millions of nerve endings send signals from every inch of you and so if something is off, your body is going to let you know \nFeeling soreness or pain around your vulva: Burning is often a term used to describe the type of pain\nPain during or after sex : This is considered ‘superficial dyspareunia’, relating to pain around the vulva and vaginal entrance. \nLight bleeding after sex: This is due to small breaks in the fragile vaginal tissue – think cracked and dry skin – which may bleed.\nUrinary symptoms: The tissues around the urinary tract are also sensitive to hormonal changes. Symptoms include increased frequency (needing to pee more often), urgency (needing to pee NOW), dysuria (painful pee) and nocturia (waking up at night to pee). Urinary tract infections are commonly linked to vaginal atrophy and dryness.\n\n\nHow to treat vaginal dryness\nMake friends with lube\nFor some of us, the only treatment needed for vaginal dryness may just be a bit of lubricant more foreplay ahead of sex! (Louder for the oblivious partners at the back!) Get some Yes water-based lube from Amazon (we earn a small commission from this link!)\nWe also have an amazing sexual health team The Lowdown who can help with contraception and hormones, sex-related concerns or pelvic health.\nOestrogen cream\nPersisting vaginal dryness will require treatment in one form or another. This may involve addressing the root cause, such as reviewing your contraception, or treatment for a medical condition. In lots of cases, all we need to do is replace what’s missing – oestrogen. The good news is that treatment is simple, affordable, well researched and effective!\nFor post menopausal women this can be done in a few ways, but an easy and safe way is through vaginal creams containing oestrogen; delivering the hormone right where you need it most. Other options include vaginal pessaries and rings containing oestrogen. \nOestrogen creams can also be safely used alongside as well as systemic hormone replacement therapy known as HRT.\n\nOestrogen applied to the vagina is a safe and effective treatment. It’s really important to be aware that the patient information packaged with vaginal hormone preparations is out of date and factually incorrect. The British Society for Sexual Medicine has highlighted this needs to be changed by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, until then you have us to keep you in the loop!\nFor premenopausal women oestrogen cream may be recommended by your healthcare professional, depending on the suspected cause for vaginal dryness. However in premenopausal women oestrogen cream is considered ‘off licence’ and so will need to be prescribed by your doctor.\nIt is important to note that oestrogen should be carefully considered for some users with specific past medical histories and/or risk factors. If you have a history of hormonally sensitive cancers in the breasts, ovaries and endometrium, or aren’t sure if you might be at risk, speak to a doctor before starting any hormonal-based treatment. \nSome lubricants and unscented moisturisers may also help manage vaginal dryness and can be used alongside or instead of vaginal oestrogen. Moisturisers should be used regularly, whereas lubricants can be used for sexual activity. \nHow oestrogen cream can help with vaginal dryness\nOestrogen creams and gels are specifically made to increase your levels of oestrogen where they’re needed most – right up in there! Formulations directly applied to the vagina and vulva allow for oestrogen absorption through the vaginal tissue and all the good stuff should spring back into action – elasticity, thickness, lubrication – aka the holy grail.\nOestrogen creams applied directly to the vagina are a very low dose compared to systemic HRT.\nHow long does it take oestrogen cream to work?\nIt usually takes a few months to see benefits from using vaginal oestrogen which can be safely used long term. For the majority of postmenopausal women unfortunately symptoms often return after treatment is stopped. However, vaginal dryness for some may be temporary, not permanent! Creams or gels containing oestrogen may need to only be used in your low oestrogen phases or to bridge the gap during a dip in your natural hormone levels until they spontaneously resolve.\nWhat to do if your vaginal dryness persists or gets worse\nIf you’ve been on every form of treatment possible and you are still not winning with your vaginal dryness- there may be an underlying cause. \nAbnormal bleeding (especially after sex) can be a sign that something isn’t right. ‘Abnormal’ may be when a little occasional post-sex bleeding turns into a lot of bleeding, or if you’re constantly having blood stained discharge. If you think this is you, or you aren’t sure, chat to your GP.\nDryness with thick, white discharge (the worst of both worlds) may be caused by vaginal thrush. Look out for cottage cheese-like discharge while also feeling very dry and itchy. Similarly, a thin yellow or grey watery discharge is indicative of bacterial vaginosis, which disrupts and elevates your vaginal pH alongside vaginal dryness. These can often be easily identified and treated by a doctor, but can also be signs of a sexually transmitted infection (STI) so it may be worth getting a test if you’re at risk – especially if your symptoms persist or get worse.\nAlmost 100% sure you have vaginal dryness but don’t know where to start with fixing it? We have incredible GPs, sex coaches and a pelvic health physio at The Lowdown on hand to help with any questions as well as further information on oestrogen creams to help you get out of the drought ASAP.\n\n\n\nDr Brenna Weaver MBChB (WITS) is a South African trained doctor, who became passionate about women’s health whilst working in under-resourced, rural communities, doing everything from Caesarean sections to contraceptive drives.\n",

        "Title": "What are the early symptoms of Menopause?",
        "Content": "\n✔️If you think this blog sound informative, make sure to check out our newsletter for more:\n\nMenopause, the dreaded (but sometimes welcomed) ‘change’ can be a bit of a minefield. Previously, limited research on menopause was available, and even less sympathy from some medical professionals, for more than half the world’s population that will inevitably have to navigate through it all. The great news is that these mindsets, medical understanding and treatments are changing rapidly, and for the better.\n\nWhat is perimenopause?\nPerimenopause, or premenopause, refers to the time leading up to the release of your ultimate egg – the last ovum to leave the ovary and end your cycle. It continues until 12 months after your last period. This is when your hormonal levels – namely oestrogen, but progesterone and testosterone also play a role – start to fluctuate. Your body may have been VERY happy to stay where it was, used to the ‘tried and tested’ levels it was exposed to cyclically for the last 30 to 40 years, and so this fluctuation may cause symptoms such as:\n\nIrregular periods\nVaginal dryness \nMuscle aches and pain \nMood changes \nSleep changes \nHot flushes \nNight sweats \nSkin and hair changes \nBrain fog \nTiredness\nChanges to libido\n\nThe average age of natural menopause in the UK is 51, but symptoms of the perimenopause can occur in the years before periods stop altogether. So what are the early symptoms of menopause?\n\nWhen should I start thinking about perimenopause?\nYou should start thinking about perimenopause in your mid to late 30s. You may not start to experience symptoms until your 40s, but as with anything….knowledge is power! If you start to learn about perimenopause before you start having symptoms, you are more prepared for what may happen and how to deal with it. The symptoms may last for between 4 to 8 years and can start gradually or suddenly. It’s important to know what you’re looking for so you can understand whether changes in your body are due to perimenopause or other medical conditions.\nCheck out perimenopause FAQs answered by Dr Fran here if you’re looking for quick answers!\nWhat are the first signs of menopause?\nOften, hot flushes, night sweats, sleep and mood disturbances are noted prior to menstruation changes, but the earliest symptoms of menopause are irregular, skipped or stopped periods. Everyone is different, so your earliest symptoms may not be the same as the next person’s. Some will only have one or two perimenopausal symptoms for a short period while their bodies are getting used to the new normal in terms of hormonal levels. Others will have every symptom in the book.\n\nBut I’m not 50 yet – am I going through early menopause?\nMenopause can be diagnosed based on the characteristic symptoms and signs mentioned above if you’re over the age of 45. However, there are a few reasons that these symptoms could be occurring even if you don’t fall into this age group. In terms of timing there are three categories of ‘menopause’: menopause, early menopause and premature menopause, also known as ‘primary ovarian insufficiency’. \nPrimary ovarian insufficiency (POI): before 40 years old\nWhen it comes to primary ovarian insufficiency, there are a few reasons why your ovaries are no longer producing oestrogen prior to ‘natural’ menopause.\n\nIf you have a genetic disorder or chromosomal abnormality (such as Turner’s syndrome) you may not have been born with very many eggs to start off with resulting in an earlier decline in oestrogen\nAutoimmune diseases can also cause insufficiency by attacking your own tissues and damaging your oestrogen production \nSimilarly if you’ve had surgery to remove your ovaries (often considered ‘surgical menopause’) or if you’ve had chemotherapy or radiation your ovaries may have been damaged and no longer function as normal\nInfections such as tuberculosis and mumps among others can cause changes that may affect ovarian functionality. \n\nA diagnosis of POI can be a difficult time. The Daisy Network is a patient run support group based in the UK with excellent resources and support.\nEarly menopause: 40-45 years old\nEarly menopause can be caused by all of the factors mentioned for causes of primary ovarian insufficiency, but also has a genetic/hereditary link. Some research has shown that if your mother went through menopause below the age of 45 then you may too. \nMenopause: 45+ years old\nAll genetically female bodies are born with a set number of eggs. We don’t produce eggs on demand like our male counterparts produce sperm. It is because of this that we have a menstrual cycle at all. Puberty initiates hormonal changes that trigger your sex organs to get going and soon enough you begin releasing an egg (ovulation) and having a menstrual period if that egg isn’t fertilised, monthly (or there abouts).  \nOur ovaries are responsible for the majority of oestrogen produced by the body. As the ovaries’ store of eggs reduces, their main function of holding and periodically releasing eggs is no longer required, and oestrogen levels drop. It is due to this hormonal rollercoaster that many of the symptoms associated with menopause occur.\nCan you test for menopause?\nMenopause and perimenopause are primarily clinical diagnoses which means that if you’re over the age of 45, a healthcare professional should be able to tell if you are going through perimenopause based on a thorough history without any blood tests. A 1 year timeframe with no period above the age of 45 with or without suggestive symptoms generally indicates the menopause. There are some special cases that may require testing, particularly if you are under the age of 45 or you wish to stop contraception.\nAs a doctor, there’s nothing I love more than having a number next to a blood/urine/swab test to give me a definitive diagnosis, this however is not the case for perimenopause. Because our hormones are on a constant rollercoaster, getting a single yes or no answer from a test is almost impossible. \nFSH (Follicle stimulating hormone) is released by the brain and responsible for the maturation of your eggs, preparing them to be released, and helps to control your menstrual cycle. The ‘normal’ range for this hormone level is incredibly broad and is dependant on which phase of your menstrual cycle you are in, and your age. \nThe general principle behind testing for FSH is that the closer to menopause you are the higher your FSH will be, and if you are post-menopausal your raised FSH level will be sustained. This can be muddied by a few factors though. If you are in perimenopause you may be cycling this month but not next, and therefore the outcome of your test will be purely dependant on when you take it – rather than if you are menopausal. Contraception containing hormones may affect your FSH levels but tests for FSH may be appropriate for women using the progestogen only pill, implant or hormonal coil to help determine when to stop contraception. We discuss this in more detail in our blog on menopause and contraception in your 40s and 50s. \nHow are menopause symptoms treated?\nFor the most part, menopause treatment is simple: getting your oestrogen levels back to a respectable level. Vaginal oestrogen in the form of creams or pessaries, for example, is a safe and effective treatment for vaginal dryness and associated menopausal symptoms such as discomfort during sex. \nSymptoms such as hot flushes need a higher dose of oestrogen to replace that which is naturally lost. This can be done in a few ways including combined hormonal contraception and hormone replacement therapy (HRT). You can check out how the mirena coil impacts menopause on our blog page. \n\nHRT comes in many forms and you can choose what is most suitable for you based on your individual circumstances and after discussing the risks and benefits with your doctor. Most people will require combined oestrogen and progestogen HRT if they have a womb.\nLifestyle measures such as eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, having a good sleep routine and stopping smoking can help manage symptoms of the menopause and improve long term health and wellbeing. Furthermore, by taking nutritional supplements you will find benefits such as stress and migraine relief as well as providing your body with all the right nutrients as it undergoes change. Supplements from Wild Nutrition and Wellwoman are great if you are seeking these benefits.  \n Whilst hormone replacement is the first line treatment for managing symptoms of the menopause, your doctor may be able to discuss with you the benefits and risks of alternative options for specific symptoms such as psychological therapies, non hormonal medications, and complementary therapies. \nFor those of us diagnosed with premature ovarian failure there is a little more to take into consideration beyond symptom relief and even long term complication prevention. The loss of the chance at your own fertility can be devastating. There are many options in terms of support available as well alternate ways to become a parent. \nWhy is treating menopausal symptoms important?\nMedication for symptomatic relief and management of menopause is entirely your choice- one which many decide against. But the problem with leaving menopausal symptoms untreated lies in the long term effects of menopause. “This can’t get worse” I hear you mutter. Oh. It can. \nOestrogen has protective qualities and when depleted can cause issues such as osteoporosis and impact on your cardiovascular health. Some studies have indicated that there is benefit in hormone therapy for women younger than 60 or within 10 years of menopause symptom onset and is especially important for those with primary ovarian insufficiency. \nWe have amazing women’s health GPs here at The Lowdown, who can provide advice to help you navigate the seemingly scary world of HRT.\n\n\n\n\nDr Brenna Weaver MBChB (WITS) is a South African trained doctor, who became passionate about women’s health whilst working in under-resourced, rural communities, doing everything from Caesarean sections to contraceptive drives.\n",

        "Content": "\n✅ If you think you’ll find this blog helpful, subscribe to our newsletter for more!\n\nUrinary Tract Infections (UTIs) During Pregnancy\nPop to the loo and there it is…the dreaded stinging burn like a thousand bees are traversing your urethra. Or that constant need to wee, over and over and OVER again. The most common symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI). Stats vary but UTIs are said to happen to at least ⅓ of women throughout their lifetime. And, the even worse part is that after having one UTI, the chance of having a recurrence within the following year is 50%. \nThe urinary tract changes during pregnancy (think decreased bladder capacity and dilated urethra), alongside hormonal changes, are why pregnant people have a higher risk of getting a UTI. In fact, a UTI is the most common bacterial infection experienced during pregnancy. \nUTI Symptoms When Pregnant\nUTIs tend to manifest with the same set of uncomfortable symptoms whether you’re pregnant or not. This is due to the bacteria that usually resides in the gut being present in the vagina and urethral areas. Classic UTI symptoms include an urge to wee more frequently (often with a sense of urgency), pain upon urination and abdominal pain. Other symptoms can be a change of urine colour and an inability to completely empty the bladder. \nIt is really important to keep check of UTIs in pregnancy because if left untreated, they can cause premature labour and severe infection like pyelonephritis (where infection spreads to the kidneys). During pregnancy, to avoid any complications affecting both you and the unborn baby, it is key that UTIs are addressed promptly to prevent the infection from the lower tract moving to the kidneys. This is one of the reasons a midwife will ask for urine samples at every visit. Thankfully, UTIs are very treatable.\nTreating a UTI Whilst Pregnant Without Antibiotics\nThere are a range of non-antibiotic treatment options for UTIs (including recurrent infections) during pregnancy. Some treatments require further research but show promise and indeed a combination of a few treatment types could be a more beneficial approach.\nHowever, if you exhibit UTI symptoms during pregnancy, it is super important that you contact your healthcare provider before buying any over the counter treatments or attempting to self-manage. They will talk through your symptoms and may conduct a urine test to confirm if you do indeed have a UTI, and whether you need antibiotics.\nWhat is D-mannose?\nIn recent years D-mannose has been gathering attention in popular media as a treatment for preventing UTIs and managing symptoms. D-mannose is a monosaccharide found naturally in fruits such as apples and oranges, as well as some vegetables including broccoli. It is seen to be effective in treating UTIs as it prevents e.coli (one of the major bacteria types that causes UTIs) from sticking to the cells in the urinary tract and causing infection. One study looked at the impact of D-Mannose versus prophylactic antibiotics. Compared to the control group (who received no drug or active substance), D-Mannose reduced the recurrence of UTI. Not only this, but there was no statistically significant difference between D-mannose and the antibiotic. Another recent study found that after 3 days, symptom relief from D-mannose was comparable to that of antibiotics. If such promising results have tempted you to try D-mannose out, order it from The Lowdown!\nIs D-mannose safe during pregnancy?\nIn the UK, the recommendation for using D-mannose is only for those who aren’t pregnant. Seek medical advice if you are pregnant, or think you may be pregnant, and think you have symptoms of a UTI. This is to avoid delay in accessing antibiotic treatment when needed due to complications on the pregnancy of UTIs\nHave a discussion with your healthcare provider about D-mannose use in pregnancy as it might be helpful to prevent UTIs, especially after sex, or if you are prone to getting UTIs. The research available concludes that D-mannose has been shown to be safe and effective throughout all stages of pregnancy. However, before deciding to take any treatment it is important to have a chat with your GP so that you can make a well-informed decision. \nIt is also worth noting that blood glucose balance can be disrupted by D-mannose supplementation. The same applies if you have diabetes, so this is another consideration to be mindful of.\nOther UTI Treatments During Pregnancy\nCranberry\nIs there any logic to this classic UTI treatment? Research varies wildly on the effectiveness of cranberry for treating UTIs, with some sources suggesting that cranberry can reduce uncomfortable symptoms whilst others showing no statistically significant results at all. The thinking behind cranberry juices or tablets as treatment is that compounds within them prevent bacteria (particularly e.coli) from sticking to the cells of the urinary tract. \nVitamin C\nSome research shows an association of decreased Vitamin C with increased risk of UTIs. Supplementing vitamin C in pregnant women reduced UTI recurrence rates after 3 months in a study of 110 pregnant women. However, more studies are required to show conclusive evidence!\nProbiotics\nProbiotics are safe in pregnancy and have been touted as an encouraging preventive measure, which could be useful for those who suffer from recurrent UTIs. They’re said to be of potential benefit as they counteract the colonisation of ‘bad’ UTI causing bacteria, with lactobacilli said to be a particularly effective probiotic. Further studies need to be conducted, but the current results are promising in administering probiotics in the prevention of recurrent UTIs, plus there is a good safety profile from the trials that have been carried out. \nLifestyle factors\nOnline research suggests various lifestyle interventions that are said to minimise the risk of UTIs. However, most of these have been explored in non-pregnant populations. One review paper concluded that preventative hygiene behaviour, such as washing after sex might be helpful to prevent UTIs.\nWhat to do if UTI symptoms persist or get worse\nIt’s important to contact your healthcare team if you have UTI symptoms during pregnancy. Antibiotic treatment should be started quickly to prevent complications affecting the pregnancy and baby. If your symptoms do not improve with treatment, you start to feel more unwell, or develop new symptoms, contact your GP or hospital maternity unit. The pregnancy charity, Tommy’s, has a helpful pregnancy symptom checker if you are unsure of what to do.\n\n\n\n\nEmma is a Pharmacology & Physiology graduate with a huge passion for women’s health.

        "Title": "Is cotton really that good for your vagina? In short, yes.",
        "Content": "\n\n–\nFirst, let’s talk about thrush and UTIs… \nBefore we get into the benefits of cotton, it’s helpful to know a bit more about two of the most common infections it can help prevent. Let’s start with the good old urinary tract infection. If you’re reading this and haven’t got a clue what we’re on about, let us start by saying – we’re jealous! \nA urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection in any part of your urinary system – so your kidneys, bladder, ureters or urethra. Symptoms can include pain or a burning sensation when you pee (joy), needing to pee ALL the time, lower tummy pain/back pain, and a high temperature (quadruple joy). \nThese infections are far from uncommon. In fact, according to one study in 2016, it was estimated that UTIs are the cause of 8.3 million outpatient clinic visits and 1 million emergency department visits globally each year. Although urinary tract infections affect all genders, “women are the most vulnerable due to their anatomy and reproductive physiology”.   \nAnother study conducted in 2013 revealed UTIs are one of the most frequent clinical bacterial infections in women, accounting for nearly 25% of all infections. The study goes on to say that “around 50-60% of women will develop UTIs in their lifetimes”, affecting women eight times more frequently than men. \nAnd what about thrush? Thrush is a symptomatic inflammation of the vagina and/or vulva, caused by a fungal infection. In plain English – thrush feels like a burning or itching sensation in your vulva and vagina, which can be extremely irritating and sore. Thrush is the second most common infection of the genital tract and affects millions of women worldwide; approximately 70-75% of women will experience at least one episode in their lifetime (don’t mind us, we’re just on infection number 310). Similarly to UTIs, certain types of underwear have been statistically associated with the development of thrush. Which leads us nicely on to… \nWhat has cotton got to do with thrush and UTIs?\nWell, quite a lot, truth be told. As co-founders of an organic cotton underwear brand, MERRI Intimates, don’t just take our word for it, the NHS also endorses the benefits of wearing cotton pants. According to a 2003 epidemiological survey, one of the factors most commonly associated with vaginal yeast infections “is wearing underwear made from synthetic fabrics, which don’t breathe, and thus keep the genital area warm and moist, the perfect conditions for growth of yeast”. In the study of eight Italian hospitals and gynaecology facilities on the causes of recurrent thrush found that “the most frequent associated factors were related to lifestyle: synthetic fabric underwear, vaginal douching and bike training”.\nAside from all its benefits for intimate health, cotton is a pretty great all round fabric. It’s soft, natural, breathable, comfortable AND looks good. Part of the reason cotton is so comfy is that it absorbs excess moisture, keeping you cosy and dry. It’s also a natural polymer and hypoallergenic, which may decrease your chances of other infections and health risks. \nSo what should we be doing to prevent the irritating, infuriating infections that so often knock on our doors? It’s perhaps most succinctly summarised by the RCOG guidance on care for vulvar skin: “wear loose-fitting silk or cotton underwear. Avoid close-fitting clothes.”\nOne 2018 study summarised that “organic cotton can properly be known as the most skin-accommodating, most calming, and most safe regular fibre”. It’s no coincidence then that a Cotton Incorporated Lifestyle Survey, found that 83% of women prefer their underwear to be made of cotton. \nWhat is organic cotton’s impact on the environment? \nWondering if organic cotton is too good to be true? Don’t worry. Organic cotton (as opposed to just cotton) is a sustainable choice for lots of reasons. Firstly, organic farmers use natural methods to grow cotton, instead of fossil-fuel based fertilisers. By working with nature, they build healthy soils that store carbon and help to combat climate change.\nOrganic cotton also helps maintain a balanced system on farms. Farmers always grow it alongside their other crops, which helps to keep soils healthy, encourage wildlife and protect topsoil. These farmers use natural methods like crop rotation to control pests and diseases, whereas non-organic farming can damage ecosystems with hazardous synthetic pesticides. \nWhy doesn’t everyone know about the benefits of organic cotton pants? \nAs with all pelvic health related issues, there’s nowhere near enough available information about the things that can help or harm us. Working in the cotton underwear industry, with a direct focus on intimate health, we have been blown away by how often people assume a UTI or thrush is a sexually transmitted infection (STI). \nThere’s so much misinformation about these infections, let alone knowledge on how to go about treating them. A 2021 study in Nigeria, looking into the different factors causing a predisposition for UTIs, showed that diseases like UTIs are often “mistreated and diagnosed because of confusing and overlapping symptoms. Particularly in the developing world, more education is needed.” And another study in 2017 looking into the role of female intimate hygiene in vulvovaginal health, concluded that “there is a paucity of published medical literature related to the vulva and how personal hygiene practices can affect it”. \nIf you’re struggling with UTIs, thrush, or both, and are feeling frustrated, check out The Lowdown’s blog on itchy vaginas, as it could be caused by your contraception. In summary –  dry properly after washing, avoid sex if it’s uncomfortable, don’t use soap on your vulva, drink lots of fluids and of course… wear cotton underwear.\n\nThis blog was written by Holly Thomas, Ella Merriman and Amelia Powell.

        "Title": "Flu-like symptoms before your period",
        "Content": "\nDo you ever feel like you’re coming down with the flu, only for your symptoms to vanish as soon as your period arrives? You might be experiencing ‘period flu’ or, more accurately, flu-like symptoms associated with premenstrual syndrome (PMS).\nMany women and other people who menstruate feel far from their best in the week or so before their period. But as well as mood swings, low mood, irritability and anxiety, PMS brings a host of physical symptoms which can leave you feeling under the weather.\nWhat is ‘period flu’?\n‘Period flu’ is a phrase which describes the flu-like symptoms some people experience before their period. Although ‘period flu’ isn’t a medical term, some people find that the hormonal changes before their period can lead to PMS symptoms which mimic colds and flu. Among others, these include tiredness, muscle aches and feeling generally unwell.\nThe majority of women and people who menstruate experience at least mild PMS during their reproductive years, but PMS can affect daily life even for those with mild to moderate symptoms. Around 5-8% of people who menstruate experience severe PMS or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) in which symptoms are more debilitating and can limit everyday activities.\nIf you’re fed up of having heavy periods and PMS every month, there are methods of contraception that can help to ease these symptoms.\nWhat are the symptoms of ‘period flu’?\nIt’s not surprising that some people compare PMS to colds and flu given the significant overlap in some of their most commonly reported physical symptoms:\n\nFatigue and lethargy\nLow-grade fever, chills or sweats\nNausea\nSore muscles\nWeakness\nDizziness\nHeadaches\nDigestive problems including constipation or diarrhoea\n\nThese aren’t the only strange symptoms you might notice before your period. In fact, more than 100 symptoms have been linked to PMS. Some of the more unusual symptoms reported by our community at The Lowdown include night sweats, mouth ulcers, cold sores, cravings and heightened sensitivity to pain or smell.\n\nWhat causes period flu?\nHormones play an important role in our emotional and physical health. Though we don’t know what exactly triggers PMS – or why some people who have periods experience more severe PMS and PMDD – it’s thought to be linked to changing levels of hormones between ovulation and the start of a period. In particular, progesterone, oestrogen and neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine have been tied to common symptoms. So why do you feel like you’ve got the flu before your period starts?\nTiredness\nMany people report feeling unusually tired and lethargic in the run up to their period. The lower level of oestrogen before a period leads to a drop in other hormones including dopamine and serotonin. This decrease in hormones can make you feel tired, as well as causing problems with sleep.\nResearch has also shown that during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle (between ovulation and the start of a period), women with PMDD are less responsive to the sleep hormone melatonin than in earlier phases of the menstrual cycle. Disturbed sleep before your period can cause fatigue, as well as exacerbating emotional symptoms like anxiety and physical symptoms like headaches.\nFever\nIf you find yourself overheating or sweating more than normal before your period, it could be down to PMS. Research has found that after ovulation core body temperature can be 0.3°C to 0.7°C higher than before ovulation because of high levels of progesterone. This means you might experience a low-grade fever, shivering, sweating or hot flushes.\nPain\nInflammation has been closely linked with some PMS aches and pains symptoms including cramps, back pain and breast pain. Pain in your back and legs in particular may be connected to the rising levels of prostaglandins. Prostaglandins cause contractions in the womb so menstrual blood can leave the body, but they can trigger pain across the back, abdomen and legs.\nYour periods could also be linked to your overall experience of pain; one study found that those who experience painful menstrual cramps were also more sensitive to deep muscle pain throughout their menstrual cycle.\nIf you’re looking for something to help ease pain from menstrual cramps, mefenamic acid could be the answer.\nNausea and digestive problems\nFeeling sick, losing your appetite and changing toilet habits are common experiences of PMS. As well as triggering womb contractions, prostaglandins can impact digestion by stimulating other smooth muscles in your body, including triggering bowel movements. Check out our blog on period poo for more info!\nThough there is little research into the impact of menstruation on gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, one study found that 73% of healthy women with no history of GI disease experienced GI symptoms before or during their period. The study also found that GI symptoms were disproportionately more likely among those dealing with emotional symptoms such as depression or anxiety.\nIs ‘period flu’ real?\nThough many PMS symptoms are very similar to those of common viruses like colds and flu, ‘period flu’ isn’t a diagnosis of its own. Although you might feel like you’re coming down with a cold every month, these symptoms aren’t caused by a virus so you don’t have to worry about passing them on to anyone else.\nBut that doesn’t mean you should write off pain and discomfort. Flu-like symptoms triggered by PMS are just as real as symptoms caused by a virus and they can affect you in a similar way. You might find it difficult to get out of bed, exercise, socialise or get on with daily life whilst dealing with fatigue, aches and pains or nausea, just as you would when sick.\nBeing aware of how your premenstrual symptoms affect you is crucial to being able to manage them. Keeping track of your periods and symptoms using a calendar, diary or period tracker can help you to identify when you might expect symptoms to begin so you can prepare yourself. Exercise, sleep, maintaining a balanced diet and minimising stress and alcohol intake may help you to ease your symptoms at home.\nIf your PMS symptoms are affecting your daily life or aren’t improving with lifestyle changes, speak to your GP about alternative treatments. They can walk you through your options including hormonal contraception, antidepressants and talking therapy.\n\n\n\nPremenstrual syndrome (Lancet, 2008), Kimberly Ann Yonkers, MD, Prof. P M Shaughn O’Brien, MD, and Prof. Elias Eriksson, MD \nPremenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder: guidelines for management (Journal of Psychiatry and Neuroscience, 2000), M Steiner\nPremenstrual Syndrome (StatPearls, 2021), Pratyusha R.

        "Title": "Mini pill brands explained (AKA progestogen-only pills)",
        "Content": "\nWhat is the progestogen-only birth control pill?\nThe progestogen-only pill, better known as the progesterone only pill, mini pill or POP, is a form of contraceptive pill which contains synthetic progestogen, similar to progesterone naturally produced by the female body. It is often used by people who are unable to use combined contraception which contains oestrogen; like if you have have a history of migraines with aura, or are over the age of 50.\nThe mini pill is one of the more popular contraceptives. There are many types of mini pill brand names including:\n\nCerelle\nCerazette\nLovima\nHana\nAizea\nDesogestrel\nDesomono\nFeanolla\nZelleta\nNorgeston \nNoriday\nSlynd\n\nWith so many different types to choose from, it begs the questions – what actually is the difference between the progestogen-only pill brands? Here’s the lowdown…\n\nWhat’s the difference between mini pill brands?\nNot all progestogen-only birth control pills are the same… there are 3 groups of mini pill (POP) in the UK:\n\nDrospirenone POPs – must be taken within 24 hours (brand names Slynd)\nTraditional POPs – must be taken within 3 hours of the same time each day (brand names Norgeston and Noriday)\nDesogestrel POPs – must be taken within 12 hours of the same time each day (all other brands!)\n\n The traditional POP prevents pregnancy by thickening the mucus in the cervix to stop sperm reaching an egg. The desogestrel and drospirenone POPs can also stop ovulation. If taken correctly, it’s more than 99% effective. This means fewer than 1 woman in 100 who uses the mini pill as contraception will get pregnant in 1 year. With “typical use” (the way it’s taken by a lot of women in real life), it’s about 91% effective.The traditional and desogestrel POPs are taken every day without a break. The drospirenone POP (brand name Slynd) comes in a pack of pills that are different colours. A white (active) pill is taken every day for 24 days in a row, and then a green (inactive) pill for the next 4 days in a row, before repeating with a new pack.³  \nWhat are the side effects of progestogen?\nProgestogen side effects can include:\n\nacne\nbreast tenderness and breast enlargement\nan increased or decreased sex drive\nmood changes\nheadache and migraine\nnausea or vomiting\nsmall fluid-filled sacs (cysts) on your ovaries – these are usually harmless and disappear without treatment\n\nThere’s not enough evidence to say these are definitely caused by POP use⁴ but these possible side effects can appear in the first few months of taking the progestogen-only birth control pill. You should contact your GP if they persist or are problematic.You may also not have regular bleeds while taking it – your bleeds may be lighter, more or less frequent, or may stop altogether, and you may get spotting between bleeds.  With the drospirenone POP, ‘scheduled’ bleeding or spotting may also occur on the days you take the inactive pills.⁴  \nTypes of desogestrel pill:\nProgestogen only pill brands containing desogestrel 75 micrograms (which therefore all have to be taken within a 12 hour window). We’ve pulled together some of our reviewers’ comments and looked at the data we’ve collected so far at The Lowdown…\nDesogestrel\n Desogestrel is the synthetic progestogen used in the generic mini pill which is also sold under varying brand names as below.All the following birth control pills have the same hormone type and quantity. There can be differences in people’s experiences using the same brand and doctors are unsure why individuals may experience slight differences between brands.\nCerelle\nCerelle is one brand of mini pill that contains desogestrel. Some of our reviewers have experienced side effects of Cerelle, including headaches and acne. For over 50% of reviewers it stopped their periods altogether.\nOne reviewer shared:\n“I’ve been on the pill for 3 and half years. It’s stopped my periods, helped my skin and prevented pregnancy. But it has made me gain weight, made me have really bad mood swings, and fatigue. I’m coming off the pill to let my body get back to normal.”Read more Cerelle reviews here.\nCerazette\nSimilar to Cerelle, Cerazette is a form of mini pill where the main ingredient is desogestrel. Over 50% of our reviewers experienced tender breasts and a reduction in their sex drive.   \n“I’ve been taking Cerazette for just over a year, when I started taking it I bled for a good few weeks and I felt nauseous for a few weeks too – but after a while I felt fine. This year I’ve only had two periods (one in March and one in July), I’ve also had a few days of spotting in-between. I’ve gained some weight this year but I’m putting it down to lack of exercise and bad diet, but when I have eaten better and exercised I have been able to see the weight shift. My sex drive is quite high anyway, and it hasn’t been affected in any way. Compared to my previous pill Loestrin, I had no migraines with auras, my anxiety decreased dramatically and my skin cleared up.”\nAnother reviewer said:\n“It started off well but after 6/7 months, I had sudden very very heavy bleeding – so heavy that I soaked 4 night time super pads over night. It also made me feel more depressed and I lost my sex drive. It’s a shame as initially other than a little breakthrough bleeding it wasn’t terrible.”Read more Cerazette reviews here.\nLovima\nLovima is a mini pill (progestogen-only pill), containing the hormone desogestrel. It is really safe for nearly every woman, but like all desogestrel pills, some of us have issues with breakthrough bleeding as there is no oestrogen in the mini pill to help with cycle control.A reviewer said:“Lovima has essentially stopped my periods, with rare spotting for 1-2 days (hardly requires a pantyliner), but mostly these only come if I have been late taking a pill (less than 12 hours late but more than 6ish hours late). My mood is definitely slightly better, I noticed it especially after > 6 months. Less side effects than a combined pill so honestly would recommend.”Read more about the Lovima pill here\nZelleta\nThe Zelleta pill also contains desogestrel. Like other progestogen-only pills, it is suitable if you are breastfeeding and may help with pre-menstrual pain or period cramps.\nSome of our reviewers reported irregular periods or a change to their mood as a Zelleta side effect.\n“I feel depressed, extremely emotional, no motivation. I have tried different contraceptions, from the implant to different pills. I hate going on contraception as it changes my personality and affects my everyday life. I just want to stay in bed everyday. My period has been so heavy. I cry everyday. I have even called in sick to work.”Read more about Zelleta reviews here.\nHana\nHana is a new brand of POP which also contains desogestrel, and was one of the first progestogen-only pills available to buy over the counter or online from a pharmacy in the UK without a prescription from July 2021, along with the Lovima pill.\nTypes of traditional POP:\nTraditional progesterone only pill brands which contain levonorgestrel or norethisterone (which each have to be taken within a 3-hour window):\nNorgeston\nNorgeston contains levonorgestrel, a synthetic form of progesterone. Like most other mini pills, Norgeston is taken back to back without a break, and most importantly it needs to be taken every day at the same time (within a three hour window).\nMost of our community reported neutral responses when asked about change to moods and body weight, however lots of women experienced irregular periods.\nRead more Norgeston reviews here.\nNoriday\nNoriday contains norethisterone, a synthetic form of progesterone. These also have to be taken within a 3 hour window every day.\nOur users’ reviews report possible side effects including vaginal discharge, spots and tender breasts.\n“Had to stop combined pill due to raised blood pressure. Started on cerazette but too much intermittent bleeding. This has stopped that, but as each month goes by I feel more pms (particularly bloating/ swollen breasts & low mood) than I ever had on previous hormonal pills.“Read more Noriday reviews here.\nWhat is the drospirenone mini pill?\nA newer POP called Slynd that contains the progestogen drospirenone is available in both the UK and US.⁴ It must be taken within 24 hours of the same time each day. It comes in a pack of pills that are different colours. A white (active) pill is taken every day for 24 days in a row, and then a green (inactive) pill for the next 4 days in a row, before repeating with a new pack.³\nUS mini pill brands 🇺🇸\nOur friends in the US have a slightly different range of brands available which include Camila, Errin, Heather, Jencycla, Jolivette, Nora-Be and Ortho Micronor.\nThese all contain a progestogen called Norethindrone (also known as norethisterone), similar to Noriday which we have in the UK. They fit under the heading of traditional progestogen-only birth control pills.\nSo what is the best mini pill to take?\nDifferent pills work better for different people – and it can be hard to know which is best for you. We have a great team of doctors who are all specially trained in contraception and sexual health to give you advice if you’re stuck in a seemingly endless search for the right mini pill brand for you. Booking an appointment is super easy!In general, doctors recommend desogestrel pills if you’re trying the mini pill for the first time, because they have a 12 hour window in which you can remember to take them.For more information, side effects and advantages/disadvantages of other progestogen-only pills including Aizea, Desomono, Feanolla and Lovima, get the lowdown on each of their contraceptive pages.

        "Content": "\nWhat’s the lowdown on catching COVID-19?\n\nThere is evidence that catching COVID-19 can temporarily impact male fertility by reducing sperm count and quality\nThere is also evidence that catching COVID-19 during pregnancy can have detrimental effects for both you and your baby towards the end of pregnancy and after birth\n\n\nIn partnership with the NHS, we ran a survey to gather information on the main concerns of young women and people who menstruate on the COVID-19 vaccine and its effects on periods and fertility, which showed that changes to menstrual cycles were a concern. In this guide we cover the latest evidence around the vaccine, alongside other external factors that can affect the menstrual cycle. You can also watch the webinar for more insight from Dr Viki and Dr Fatima.\nDoes the vaccine impact pregnancy in clinical trials?\n\nIn these clinical trials for Pfizer and Moderna, participants were asked to use reliable contraception. There were some accidental pregnancies (this is to be expected, as no method of contraception is 100% effective), but these happened at basically the same rate, despite whether a participant had received the vaccine or the control.\nThis shows that the vaccines in these trials did not reduce the chances of participants becoming pregnant – both pregnancy rates are low because every one of them was on contraception. Furthermore, the miscarriage rate (SA rate) was also more or less the same across the vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups.\nWill getting the COVID-19 vaccine affect my fertility?\nNo, there is no evidence that having the COVID-19 vaccine impacts either male or female fertility. There have been a range of studies in this area, with the first evidence coming from IVF clinics (see references). Across these studies, it has been shown that in IVF settings there’s no difference in clinical pregnancy rates and in other measures of fertility – such as ovarian function, egg quality, and fertilisation – between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. Three of these studies specifically looked at fertility rates before and after vaccination, too. But does this still apply if you’re trying to conceive naturally? In short, yes.\nA 2022 US study tracking more than 2000 couples trying to conceive ‘spontaneously’ over the course of 10 months also found that COVID-19 vaccination makes no difference to both male and female fertility on your chance of conception, and in the months that you have the vaccine there’s not even a temporary difference.\nMultiple studies have shown that COVID-19 vaccination does not alter sperm count or quality, or reduce the chances of conception for a male partner (see references).\nThe really interesting thing this study found was that while catching COVID-19 doesn’t affect female fertility, it can affect male fertility. It found that if a male partner had COVID-19, a couple would be less likely to conceive for two months after this, as COVID-19 infection reduces sperm count and quality for around 60 days.\nWill the vaccine affect my periods?\nThere’s been lots of anecdotal evidence of people reporting either heavier, later, shorter and lighter periods, and there weren’t any significant studies around this for what felt like ages. Due to the fact that there are many external factors that can affect periods (we’ll come to that in a moment) which causes a natural variation in cycles anyway, it was difficult to know whether the changes that people were noticing were down to the vaccine, or because they were paying more attention to their cycles after the vaccine as they were expecting a change.\nThere are now two large, well-designed studies which looked specifically at these changes. One by the digital contraception app Natural Cycles, and another from Norway. The Natural Cycles study looked at period delays. It compared 2403 participants who had the vaccine with 1556 participants who didn’t. They found that the first dose of the vaccine in this cohort didn’t cause any delays to periods. The second dose of the vaccine, however, delayed the next period by only half a day.\nThe main change noted in this study was found in participants who had both of their vaccines in the same cycle, which resulted in a 2.3 day delay to their next period. Despite this delay, these participants’ cycles were back to normal two months after. (Note that in the UK, it is unlikely that you will have two doses of the vaccine within the same menstrual cycle). In short, any changes to your menstrual cycle after COVID-19 vaccination are small and reversible.\nIn the Norwegian study of 6000 participants who had regular periods, 37.8% of unvaccinated people reported a change to their period. This creeps up to 39.4% noticing a change after the first dose of the vaccine, and 40.9% after the second dose. The main change being that they experienced a heavier period. At the point of publishing, they hadn’t tracked it long enough to see when this effect was reversed. However, it shows that the differences are still small. In terms of periods being delayed, this study couldn’t find any delay when they asked participants to reflect on their previous periods – so while we can see these small changes in analysed data (the Natural Cycles study), anecdotally many of us may not notice a delay.\nDoes this evidence also apply to the booster vaccine?\nNone of the above studies specifically look at the booster vaccine, but it is highly likely that the evidence shown for the first and second doses will also apply to the booster. This could be a small delay to your cycle, or a potentially slightly heavier period than normal. Or, you may not experience any changes at all!\nWhy might the vaccine have an effect on my periods?\nThere’s no strong evidence as to exactly why, but Reproductive Immunologist, Dr Viki Male, suggested two possibilities for this in our webinar. Firstly, the immune system and sex hormones can cross-talk. So if the immune system has a big stimulation, i.e. the vaccine, that could potentially have a temporary effect on sex hormones. The sex hormones drive periods, so this could potentially cause a delay, or make them heavier. Secondly, the lining of the uterus is rich in immune cells which are important for the build up and break down of the uterus lining as part of the menstrual cycle. If we have this big immune stimulation, this could also potentially affect those cells and how they build up or break down the uterus lining.\nWhat else can cause changes and irregularities to periods?\nAs we’ve established, there’s a lot of cross-talk that happens between your brain and your ovaries, which means that there are numerous things that can impact your period flow, cycle length, and even stop periods altogether, including:\n\nToo much exercise or stress\nBeing overweight (generally BMI over 30) or extreme changes in weight\nPuberty and menopause (if periods suddenly become irregular before the age of 45 this needs investigating)\nMedical conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\n\nChanges to your cycle because of the factors above would last longer than two to three cycles. They should not be attributed to the vaccine side-effects and if symptoms persist these should be investigated, so please see your GP.\nIt’s important to remember all forms of hormonal contraception and some non-hormonal such as the copper coil (IUD) can impact your periods. Take a look at our contraception pages and reviews to see what other users of each method have experienced, or take our contraception quiz to see which form of contraception is recommended best for you. Pregnancy is also a reason for periods to change and stop altogether so consider doing a pregnancy test as no contraceptive method is 100% effective. \nWhen should I be worried about irregular periods?\nHow can you tell if it’s a side effect of the vaccine, or if it’s something else? \nVaginal bleeding can have many causes including polyps, infections, or cervical ectropion. If you’re still experiencing unusual bleeding after two cycles, then it’s not down to the COVID-19 vaccine. The MHRA advises: “anyone experiencing changes to their periods that are unusual for them, persist over time, or has any new vaginal bleeding after the menopause, following COVID-19 vaccination, should contact their doctor.”\nHere’s what you should look out for:\n\nConstant bleeding, or bleeding for longer than 7 days each cycle\nBleeding between periods\nBleeding after sex regularly\nCycles longer than 6 weeks, continuing for several cycles\nSTI symptoms\n\nWhen it comes to bleeding between periods, bleeding and spotting at the time of ovulation can be normal for some. However, if you’ve noticed bleeding that becomes heavier, or lasts a few days between periods, then it’s best to get it checked out. It’s also important to make sure your cervical smear tests are up to date!\nIf I don’t get the vaccine and I catch COVID-19, will that impact my periods?\nLike a lot of illnesses, there’s evidence to show that if you get COVID-19, it can temporarily affect your menstrual cycle. One study looked at how COVID-19 infection might impact the menstrual cycle, specifically analysing sex hormones. While it couldn’t find a particular difference to hormones it did find that a quarter of participants reported changes to their period after catching COVID-19. Another study looking into the effects of long COVID also found that 15% reported changes to their periods after infection.\nDr Viki shares this advice: “if you’re really worried about your periods, not getting vaccinated is not the solution”.\nIs it safe to get the vaccine if you’re pregnant?\nYes, it is safe to get the COVID-19 vaccine if you’re pregnant. There are now multiple studies across more than 185,000 people who have been vaccinated whilst pregnant, looking for things like increased risk of miscarriage, premature birth, stillbirth, the baby being born smaller than expected, and congenital abnormalities. No increased risk for any of these has been found from COVID-19 vaccination. Links to these studies can be found below.\nThere is strong evidence that COVID-19 infection in pregnancy can have a detrimental impact on you and your baby, however, particularly during the second term of pregnancy. There is an increased risk of premature birth, pre-eclampsia, stillbirth or infant death shortly after birth. This is why, like the flu and whooping cough vaccines, the NHS offers the COVID-19 vaccine to everyone who is pregnant. If you’re planning on getting pregnant, or are pregnant, and are currently unvaccinated, it’s important to consider these risks and COVID-19 vaccination will give you the best chance of avoiding them.\nWhat about vaccinating young girls who have just started menstruating, or who haven’t yet begun?\nLess research has been done on younger people, partially because it’s been the 18+ age group who have been vaccinated. It’s also harder to do research on children and this type of research is tougher because the menstrual cycle varies so much when you just start having periods. It can take up to eight years for your brain and ovary connection to mature, so it’s really hard to know what the normal is for somebody aged 11. If you notice a change in your child, or they notice a change, that could just be normal pre-teen and teenage period cycles taking a while to settle down.\nHow does the COVID-19 vaccine work?\nThe effects of vaccines come in two waves. The first is the innate immune response which happens straight away, causing sore arms, fever and headaches etc. This could potentially be the cause of the small, temporary changes to periods too. The second wave is the adaptive immune response which kicks in after around 10 days, and lasts for about 28 days. This is what gives you protection against COVID-19 infection. In some cases, this response can also cause side effects, which will appear within 28 days. Studies usually track any effects up to 6 months, anything that hasn’t appeared within that time isn’t likely to happen after, because the vaccine is actually only active in your body for 7 days, with the immune response then being active for 28 days.\nFor ongoing information on the latest evidence around the COVID-19 vaccine, menstrual cycle and fertility, check out Dr Viki’s handy online explainer document.\nIVF setting studies:\n\nhttps://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Fulltext/9900/In_Vitro_Fertilization_and_Early_Pregnancy.378.aspx\nhttps://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/36/9/2506/6345462\nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.30.21258079v1.full.pdf\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666334121000684\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8116639/\n\nEffects on male fertility after vaccination studies:\n\nhttps://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2781360\nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.30.21255690v1.full.pdf\n\nGetting the vaccine during pregnancy studies:\n\nhttps://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2104983?query=featured_home\nhttps://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2113891\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-09-22/09-COVID-Olson-508.pdf\nhttps://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2790607\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01666-2\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-09-22/10-COVID-Kharbanda-508.pdf\nhttps://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2784193\nhttps://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2114466\nhttps://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2782047\nhttps://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(21)00873-5/pdf\nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1050721/Vaccine-surveillance-report-week-4.pdf\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8378017/\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X21011919?via%3Dihub\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7101e1.htm\nhttps://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2788938\n\nOther references:\n\nGeorgia is our resident content know-it-all.

        "Content": "\n✅ If you think you’ll find this blog helpful, check out our newsletter for more:\n\nLife can be draining as it is, so the prospect of yet another thing making you sleepy is an unwelcome one. There are reports that one side effect of contraception can be tiredness. Let’s take a bleary eyed look at the evidence behind this. \nWhich contraceptive methods are we talking about? \nWe’re only looking at hormonal contraceptives here, to see if the impact on our hormones causes the side effect of feeling tired.\nCombined pill: Containing progestogen and oestrogen, this oral contraceptive provides effective birth control by preventing the ovaries releasing an egg each month, thickening mucus in the neck of the womb and thinning the lining of the womb. \nContraceptive patch: Oestrogen and progestogen are absorbed into the body via the skin\nVaginal ring: Another combined method, where a plastic ring containing the hormones is placed inside the vagina \nProgestogen-only pill: Also known as ‘POP’ or  ‘mini pill’, traditional POPs work by thickening the cervical mucus to prevent sperm reaching the egg. Additionally, the desogestrel POP can stop ovulation. \nSubdermal implant: A plastic rod is placed under the skin in the upper arm, releasing progestogen. \nInjection: Progestogen is directly released into the bloodstream.\nHormonal Intrauterine System (IUS): A device inserted into the womb, releasing progestogen. Also known as the hormonal coil.\nMorning after pill: Emergency contraception (Levonelle or EllaOne) contains hormones that work to delay ovulation. \n\nDoes my particular contraception cause tiredness? \nWe researched the hormones for each contraceptive type outlined above and a sample of patient leaflets for a cross-section of their brand names and every single one had ‘tiredness’ as a side effect. If you fancy some bedtime reading find out more on drugs.com and electronic medicines compendium (said no-one, ever).  \nNow, onto the interesting bit…why does the pill make you tired? And could coming off the pill cause tiredness? Is ‘pill fatigue’ a thing?\nContraception and tiredness: What does the research say?\nThere are a range of studies focused on tiredness and hormonal contraceptives. If you think about it, use of hormonal contraception in some ways mimicks pregnancy and what’s one symptom pregnant women often have…you got it, tiredness! \nBroadly, it is thought that the use of hormones in contraceptives is the reason behind changes to energy levels or sleep, but the mechanisms behind this are far from clear. Supporting this further, studies show compelling evidence that sleep complaints are often associated with menstrual irregularities, with lighter sleep stages and more awakenings. \nOne 2013 study which looked at sleep patterns in women on hormonal contraceptives found that, in comparison the women who were not on contraception, the apnea-hypopnea index was lower (a higher score can indicate sleep apnoea where you stop breathing for periods of 10 seconds or more) and sleep efficiency and duration was better! \nIn contrast to sleep quality during the night, there can be some negative effects on energy levels for those on contraceptives. A 2020 study showed that generally, women on hormonal contraceptives exhibited more sleepiness during the day and insomnia at night. Compared to combined contraceptives, the participants on progestogen-only methods had lower sleep duration.\nOverall, research recognises a sedating effect of progesterone (although oestrogen does play a role, it is less understood). In fact, there is investigation as to whether a progesterone only contraceptive could be a beneficial treatment for women with insomnia. \n\nHow is fatigue different to being tired?\nTiredness typically has a clear cause –  it could be a bad night’s sleep worrying about your 9am appraisal, an evening fuelled by too much alcohol or after a 6-hour hike up Snowdonia the day before. Basically, it’s a totally expected feeling that you get after certain activities, solved by a good night’s sleep (or two). \nFatigue has been described as ‘daytime tiredness’, where despite a full night’s sleep you don’t feel refreshed. However, it’s much more than this, with a constant lack of energy, and excessive whole body tiredness that can affect normal functioning and quality of life. Research is yet to fully identify the mechanisms of fatigue, but theories are that brain misregulation of the circadian (body) clock means that periods of mental alertness aren’t controlled as they should be. \nFatigue is linked to many underlying causes, including depression, thyroid conditions and anaemia. \nFatigue and sleep patterns – what’s the link?\nResearch shows insomnia affects between 6% to 9.5% of adults, but there’s not a clearcut link between sleep problems, and fatigue. Studies do suggest that sleep quality, duration and number of awakenings can worsen fatigue. However, mental and physical health also have a considerable influence on fatigue.\nComing off the pill and tiredness\nInitially, your hormone levels will change as your usual menstrual cycle returns. Different phases of the menstrual cycle may also affect your energy levels. A study by the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism showed that use of contraception containing oestrogen such as the combined pill is associated with increased levels of vitamin D. Therefore coming off the pill may cause Vitamin D levels in some people to decrease, which can lead to tiredness and fatigue. By taking supplements such as Wild Nutrition for Vitamin D can help overcome this exhaustion. \nWhat’s the bottom line? \nSo there is a link, but research doesn’t yet have a general consensus on exactly how contraceptives cause tiredness and the effects on each individual. Studies have shown positive and negative effects of the hormonal influence on sleep and energy levels. If you notice that you need to catch more zzzz’s on a new contraceptive, this may be something to discuss with your GP, or one of the Lowdown’s contraception experts!\n\nEmma is a Pharmacology & Physiology graduate with a huge passion for women’s health.

        "Content": "\n\nThis information can help you better understand how to safely start or switch to a different contraceptive method. It is based on guidance from the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Health in the UK and should never be used as a substitute for medical advice \nYou should always consult a healthcare professional if you have any questions or concerns \nIf contraception is not used correctly there is always a potential risk of pregnancy, even if the actions suggested below are followed\n\nSo you’ve made a decision and you’re about to start your new contraceptive or switch to a different option. If you’re not quite there with your decision, you can still use our contraception reviews, take our contraception quiz to recommend the best contraceptive for you, or get advice from our women’s health doctors. We wish switching could be simple, but, as with everything contraception related it can be complicated. We also recognise that switching between contraceptive methods can be a risky time for pregnancy if not done correctly.

        "Title": "Do I need to give my body a break from contraception?",
        "Content": "\n✅ If you think this blog will be interesting, check out our newsletter for more:\n\nIf you’ve been on hormonal contraception for a while, you might be wondering whether it’s time to take a break. This is a totally valid concern that lots of people have, be it because they’re noticing possible side effects, are thinking of trying for a baby or just want to give a different method a go. There are loads of reasons you might want to take a breather from your contraception, but the question is: do you need to? \nFirst of all, let’s set out exactly what we mean when we talk about taking a break from contraception. Combined hormonal contraception users of the pill, patch and vaginal ring may have a week-long break from their chosen method every month, but evidence shows that this is not necessary. \nWe’ve created a full breakdown on back-to-back pill-taking, however in this article, we’re going to talk about what the science says about longer pauses: going off your hormonal contraception for more than a week or two. \nWhat happens when you take the pill for a long time?\nSome people worry that taking their hormonal contraception continuously for a long period of time – several years – will cause a build-up of hormones in their body, and that a break will help to ‘reset’ things. Others worry that their body is working harder on the pill, or is being put under stress from the hormones some contraceptives contain. These are logical doubts that many of us have, and it’s great to think about the way our contraception is affecting us. Once we understand how the pill works, though, it’s pretty reassuring. \nMost methods of hormonal birth control work to stop ovulation, preventing fertilisation of an egg and, as a result, pregnancy. The hormones in birth control that make this happen essentially pause the menstrual cycle. A daily dose of the pill is required to achieve this so there’s no build-up of hormones, and our body is actually having a break from ovulation when we’re on hormonal birth control. \nThere’s one particular rumour (aka myth) that swims around, and it’s a question we get asked a lot here at The Lowdown. Should you have a break from the pill after 10 years? There’s actually no evidence to show that this is beneficial at all, and your doctor will usually tell you that you can keep taking the pill for as long as you want to and it is safe for you to do so. There may actually be some risks associated with stopping and restarting the pill, which we’ll dive into now.\nGoing back to the pill after a break\nThere are many reasons you might want to take a break from the pill, and we’ll look more into those in a moment. But if you’re here simply because you’re wondering whether a break would be good for you, and you don’t have any other reasons for stopping (like side effects or trying for a pregnancy) research tells us the answer is no. \nFertility\nAs contraception’s main goal is to stop you from getting pregnant, it makes sense to wonder whether taking it for a long time will impact your fertility. In reality, though, research has shown that those who have stopped taking hormonal contraception have very similar levels of fertility to those stopping other forms of contraception, like condoms. \nIn fact, several studies have found that fertility is not affected by the type of contraception you were taking before you stopped. \n\nRisk of Blood Clots\nThere is a proven link between oral contraception and blood clots, which we’ve previously taken a deep dive into. Understandably, many of us are concerned about these risks. Before you begin oral contraception, you should speak to a doctor (we’ve got some lovely ones who can talk things through with you) about your personal risk factors, such as smoking and your weight.\nIf you take a combined oral contraceptive pill, like Yasmin or Millinette, your risk of blood clots is highest when you are just starting your contraception if you have never taken it before. In these cases this may be because taking a combined hormonal contraceptive can uncover any clotting issues you might naturally have. \nResearch has shown, however, that your risk of blood clots could be higher if you stop taking combined hormonal contraception for four weeks or more and then restart it again. \nCancer\nThere is evidence to show that the use of combined hormonal contraception could increase your risk of cervical ancauses-of-thrushd breast cancer, but this increased risk is small and reduces with time after stopping. One study showed that any increased risk of cervical cancer declines once combined hormonal contraception is stopped, but could take longer to reduce in long-term users.\nThis might sound scary, but other research has actually found that those who take oral hormonal contraception, or have taken it in the past, have a significantly reduced chance of developing some cancers such as endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer and colorectal cancer. The risk of developing both endometrial and ovarian cancer reduces the longer you take hormonal contraception.\nIt is a good idea to look at your family history to see whether you are likely to have a naturally higher risk of developing a certain type of cancer. Your doctor will be able to talk this through with you in more detail. \n\nWhen should I have a break from my contraception?\nThere are some scenarios which might mean that a break from your contraception – or stopping it altogether – is the right choice for you. \nAge\nThe risks we mentioned above are minimal for most contraception users, and the benefits of hormonal contraception use are often greater than the chances of a negative outcome. That being said, there are some situations in which the risks associated with hormonal contraception could actually outweigh the benefits. Generally those over the age of 50 are advised not to use combined hormonal contraception for this reason. \nWith age, women tend to be at increased risk of osteoporosis, a medical condition where the bones become brittle and fragile. The injection is linked with a small drop in your bone mineral density which recovers when you stop using it, but for some this may mean the contraceptive injection, such as Sayana Press is a less suitable choice as they get older.\nPlanning a family\nIf you are thinking of starting a family, you’ll want to stop taking your contraception altogether. If you take hormonal contraception for reasons other than pregnancy prevention, or have had a baby already and are looking at restarting your contraception, we’ve got a great article that covers everything you need to know.\nSide effects\nUsually, any negative side effects you experience from hormonal contraception will lessen the longer you stick with it. It’s unlikely that you will develop new side effects after taking a particular contraception for a period of longer than a few months, but if you think this is the case for you it might be worth having a chat with your healthcare professional. \nIf you are trying a new hormonal contraception, though, or have tried several and are experiencing unwanted side effects, you may want to consider switching to a different method.\nSwitching contraceptives\nIf you do decide to switch your contraceptive method, there are lots of options for you to choose from. You don’t need to have a break between hormonal contraception methods, and can move straight onto non-hormonal alternatives if you find that hormonal contraception isn’t working for you. Use our contraception comparison tool to directly compare two methods, or take our contraception recommender quiz to find a method that could work best for you.\n\nFollowing your doctor’s advice\nIn some cases, your doctor may advise you to stop taking hormonal contraception. This could be due to a number of factors, such as your weight, smoking status or family history of cancer or blood clots. These cases are highly individualised, and the best alternatives will vary from person to person. \nSo should you take a break from the pill?\nIn short, unless your individual circumstances suggest that you should, you do not medically need to give your body a break from hormonal contraception. This applies to all hormonal contraception, be it combined hormonal contraception methods like the pill, patch, or vaginal ring, or progestogen-only methods like the mini pill, implant, injection or hormonal coil . As long as you’re feeling well, and your method is considered safe and working for you, feel free to stick with it for as long as it suits you.\n\nMary Hargreaves is a writer and author with a passion for women’s reproductive health.

        "Content": "\n\nhttps://youtu.be/K-XBM6nk8_I\n\n\nSince the COVID-19 vaccination programme began, there’s been much debate and questioning around the effects of the vaccine on menstrual cycles, periods and fertility.\nSpoiler alert: there is no evidence that the COVID-19 vaccine effects fertility, as discussed in our previous webinar with Dr Viki Male.\nWith lots of women anecdotally reporting changes to their cycle, this sparked concern among young women as to whether they want to get vaccinated, due to potential short or long-term effects on their periods.\nNow, two years since the start of the pandemic, there is emerging research into the effects of the vaccine on the menstrual cycle – but many people are still confused and unsure about the findings.\nSo, The Lowdown and NHS have teamed up to discuss the latest evidence and research. We’re also conducting a survey on why some young women are hesitant to get the COVID-19 vaccine, to see how we can help them get informed.\n\n–\nWe’re pleased to welcome back Dr Viki Male, who has spent several years looking at the immune reactions in the uterus, and is the current foremost quoted specialist on COVID-19’s affects on fertility, pregnancy and periods in the UK! She currently works as a Lecturer in Reproductive Immunology at Imperial College London.\nWe are also joined by Dr Fatima Husain, a leading gynaecologist and obstetrician with advanced specialist training in IVF and infertility. With over 30 years experience, Fatima currently manages Windsor Gynaecology & Fertility, and is Lead Clinician for the Fertility Service at Heatherwood and Wexham Park hospitals.\nJoin our Founder Alice, Viki and Fatima in discussing the latest evidence around the COVID-19 vaccine and its impact on the menstrual cycle and fertility. \nIn this short webinar, you’ll learn:\n\nWhat is the latest research on the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine on periods and the menstrual cycles and what does this mean for you?\nWill getting the COVID-19 vaccine impact you or your partner’s fertility?\nWill the COVID-19 vaccine impact my contraception?\nPlus, lots of interesting things about the menstrual cycle including other things that can impact it!\n\n–\nThis webinar took place via Zoom on Tuesday 22nd March.\n",

        "Title": "A complete guide to non hormonal contraception",
        "Content": "\nA huge attraction for many people considering non hormonal contraception is the minimal-to-no risk of the side effects that are associated with hormonal contraception. This isn’t to say that hormonal contraception is inherently worse than non hormonal methods – hormonal methods have non-contraceptive benefits too – it’s simply down to personal preference! Whatever contraceptive you choose, make sure it’s the right one for you.\nWhat is non hormonal birth control?\nNon hormonal contraception simply means a method of birth control that contains no synthetic hormones that work to prevent pregnancy. Non hormonal contraception comes in various forms; be that internal like the copper IUD, external barrier methods like condoms or a ‘natural’ way of calculating when you are fertile and avoiding unprotected sex at this time.\nThere’s been some interesting developments in ‘natural’ non hormonal birth control methods in recent years. ‘Digital contraception’ like the Natural Cycles app uses smart tech and algorithms to create a method of contraception that’s been shown to be 93% effective with typical use. Essentially, an updated version of the historic symptothermal and cycle tracking methods, known as Fertility Awareness Methods (FAM).\nBut it’s not all cycle tracking and working out your fertile days! While tracking methods can make you feel more in tune with your natural menstrual cycle and hormone fluctuations, all that admin isn’t for everyone. The copper coil (IUD) is a non-hormonal long acting reversible contraceptive (LARC), a great option for those who just want to ‘set it and forget it’ as once fitted it can last for years. And of course, there’s always the trusty condom – which unlike the rest of these methods, helps to protect you from STIs.\nKeep reading for a full breakdown of the many forms of non hormonal contraception. To work out which method may work best for you, try our contraception recommender, or book an appointment with one of our lovely women’s health GPs for advice.\nIntrauterine Devices\nAn intrauterine device (IUD) is a small device placed inside the womb to prevent pregnancy. The hormonal alternative to the IUD is the intrauterine system (IUS), which releases small amounts of the hormone progestogen to prevent pregnancy. But how does the IUD work without hormones?\nThe copper coil (IUD)\nThe copper coil (IUD) is a small T-shaped device made of plastic and copper. It lasts for 5-10 years and has an overall rating of 5 stars on The Lowdown – one of the highest rated methods we have! It works to prevent pregnancy by releasing tiny amounts of copper into the womb which affects the motility of any sperm, and preventing the fertilisation of an egg. Because of this, the copper coil is also a form of emergency contraception which can be fitted after unprotected sex. Check out our emergency contraception guide for more on this.\nThis non hormonal contraception method could work for you if you don’t want to have to remember to take a contraceptive every day or every time you have sex. Sounding too good to be true? Something to consider with the copper coil is its potential impact on your bleeds – over 60% of reviewers on The Lowdown reported having heavier periods. For more information on the copper coil, check out our complete guide.\nTo have a copper coil fitted, you need to make an appointment with your GP or local sexual health clinic.\nThe Ballerine IUB\nThe Ballerine IUB (intrauterine ball) is a newer non hormonal contraceptive that works in exactly the same way as the copper coil to prevent pregnancy. The main differences being it is smaller, and made of 17 copper balls on a string that sit in a spherical shape. Because of the type of plastic used and the IUB’s rounded shape, it contracts and expands more easily with the womb muscles.\nThis little non hormonal intrauterine device has been on everyone’s lips since it launched in Europe in 2014. We consistently get asked when it will be available on the NHS in the UK, and the unfortunate answer is that we don’t yet know for sure! The pandemic halted plans to roll out the IUB in the UK, but we hope it will be available within the next year. Trust us – we will let you know when it is! For now, have a look at our guide to the IUB for more information.\nDigital Contraception\nEver heard of the term ‘digital contraception’? It’s an exciting new development in non-hormonal birth control and fertility awareness methods (more on those later). Digital contraceptives are essentially fertility tracking methods that neatly store your inputted data in an app, with clever algorithms that help you work out when you are fertile.\nNatural Cycles\nThe Natural Cycles app was the first FDA cleared (US) and CE marked (Europe) digital contraceptive. Essentially, these accreditations mean it’s the real deal. Derived from the symptothermal method that’s been used for years as birth control, Natural Cycles is powered by an algorithm that analyses your daily temperature to work out your ‘fertile’ and ‘non fertile’ days, aka, red and green days. Something that blew our minds is that Natural Cycles has been shown to be as effective as the pill with typical use (93%).\nUsing a basal thermometer, you measure your temperature first thing in the morning when you wake up. You then input your temperature into the app along with recording when you have a period. You also have the option to track any other menstrual cycle updates (like how heavy your flow is), mood changes, vaginal discharge, sex drive and physical symptoms. The more temperature and cycle data you log, the more accurate the data will be! This allows the algorithm to get to know your natural cycle and predict your fertile window around when you ovulate. If you forget to measure, the app doesn’t get any less effective, you might just get more red days. For those with conditions that affect temperature, or those with irregular cycles, the app may not be able to predict ovulation and therefore may also give more red days. Remember, when you have ‘red’ fertile days, abstain from sex or use other contraception such as condoms. If relying on condoms on fertile days make sure you use these consistently and correctly. With typical use condoms have been shown to be only around 85% effective. \nYou can now use Natural Cycles alongside the Oura Ring, a smart ring that analyses and sends temperature trend data straight from the ring to your Natural Cycles app. This means you can track your temperature automatically whilst sleeping, rather than manually taking your temperature when you wake up. The ring is quite pricey from what we can tell, but it’s a cool new development in digital contraception and worth investing if you don’t want to take your temperature every morning! Find out more about how the Oura Ring compatibility works in our guide to Natural Cycles.\nIf you’re curious about this non hormonal method but aren’t sure about making the switch just yet, some people choose to use Natural Cycles alongside having a copper coil (IUD). This ensures you will be protected from pregnancy even on ‘red’ fertile days, whilst getting to know more about your body’s hormone fluctuations, PMS symptoms and menstrual cycle. So if you’re thinking about making the switch to digital contraception and fertility tracking, ‘doubling up’ with the copper coil could be an option.\nCheck out our complete guide to Natural Cycles for more information, including a breakdown of that clinical effectiveness number (yes, it really has been shown to be as effective as the pill), how to use it, and the pros and cons of this digital contraceptive. If you’re already intrigued, head to this link for 15% off a Natural Cycles subscription and a free thermometer using the code LOWDOWN15!*\n*FYI – this is an affiliate link, which means The Lowdown will earn a commission on any purchases made.\nClue\nThe US based period tracking app Clue is soon bringing out their own digital contraception, which will only be available in the United States. Similar to Natural Cycles, this birth control method is app-based and will be FDA-cleared. From the little we know about it so far, we can tell that it primarily uses period tracking to prevent pregnancy. According to Clue and this study, their birth control app has been shown to be 92% effective with typical use. Stay tuned for more updates! You can also learn more about Clue birth control reviews and side effects on The Lowdown page.\n\nFertility Awareness Methods\nFertility awareness methods (FAM), also known as natural family planning, means learning how to identify your own fertile window through indicators such as cycle length, cervical fluid or discharge, or daily temperature. It can also refer to natural contraception methods like breastfeeding – yep, our bodies are amazing like that. When using a fertility awareness method, it’s recommended you use other contraception such as condoms or abstain from sex in your fertile window.\n\nBreastfeeding (LAM)\nBy following specific conditions, breastfeeding can actually be used as a non hormonal method of contraception, also known as the Lactational Amenorrhea Method (LAM). And when done right, it’s 98% effective. If you want to use breastfeeding as contraception, check out our guide with more information on the three conditions required:\n\nYour baby is less than six months old\nYou are exclusively (or almost exclusively) breastfeeding day and night\nYour periods have not returned\n\nSymptothermal Method\nThe symptothermal method is when you observe and chart your menstrual cycle, cervical fluid, \nwaking temperature and other biological signs to identify the fertile window in your cycle. You can do this using a good ol’ paper and pen, keeping track of this information using a calendar or a log in your phone. We would recommend, as one Lowdown reviewer mentions, learning more about this method from a Fertility UK instructor to ensure you are using it as effectively as possible.\nWhile this method can be super empowering, something to consider is whether you know you will be able to reliably track your waking temperature and your menstrual cycle – so this may not be the best method for someone doing shift work, who has an irregular schedule or even a condition that can affect your ability to carry out daily tasks, such as depression or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Speak to a healthcare professional for further advice.\nBarrier methods\nWhat is a barrier method? These non hormonal contraceptives pretty much do exactly what they say on the tin: creating a thin barrier between the genitals so that sperm cannot enter the womb to fertilise an egg.\nMale condoms\nThe most well known barrier method out there, the male condom is a single-use barrier method of non hormonal contraception. Made of thin latex or polyurethane, a condom covers the penis to catch any sperm released during ejaculation. The biggest advantage of using condoms is that they also help protect you from STIs. Check out our condom FAQs for the answer to ‘can a condom really get lost inside you’? We know you want to.\nFun fact: you can also create a makeshift dental dam from a male condom for use during oral sex. A dental dam creates a barrier over the vulva or anus to help prevent the spread of STIs. To do this, use a new condom fresh from the packet, cut off the tip, base and down one side so it opens up into one larger piece of stretchy material, and voila! Never cut or split condoms otherwise, as you will not be protected from pregnancy.\nFemale condoms\nA lesser known and lesser used method of non hormonal contraception is the female condom, sometimes called a ‘femidom’. Another single-use barrier method made of thin plastic, the female condom is a tube-like pouch that is inserted into the vagina that can also protect against STIs. With typical use, the female condom is around 79% effective, whereas the male condom is around 85% effective.\nThe cap or diaphragm\nThe cap or diaphragm is a reusable non hormonal contraceptive that is less popular now than it was around 20 years ago. It’s a circular dome-shape, made of soft silicone, and is inserted into the vagina similarly to a menstrual cup. For the cap or diaphragm to be effective, it must be used with spermicide, and you need to check that it is covering your cervix. Your healthcare provider will be able to show you how to effectively use this method.\nPermanent contraception\nAnd finally, there’s permanent contraception. While non hormonal, these methods do require a surgical procedure to take place. Because of this, they are not routinely offered to younger people.\nFemale sterilisation\nFemale sterilisation, aka getting your tubes tied, is a permanent method of non hormonal contraception that involves a surgical procedure. In order to prevent pregnancy, the fallopian tubes are blocked or sealed to stop eggs reaching the sperm and becoming fertilised. This method is not routinely offered to younger people, as it’s a non-reversible surgical procedure that will prevent you from having any children in future. You’re more likely to be accepted for female sterilisation if you’re over 30, or have already had children.\nVasectomy\nA vasectomy (also known as male sterilisation) is a permanent surgical procedure. It can technically be reversed in some cases, but not easily – and also, what a faff. The tubes that carry a man’s sperm are cut or sealed, preventing pregnancy by stopping any sperm making its way into semen. So when ejaculation occurs, releasing semen into the vagina, there’s no sperm to fertilise an egg.\nWhat’s the future of non-hormonal contraception?\nHopefully we won’t have to wait too much longer for the Ballerine IUB to be rolled out across the UK, but what else should we look out for? Natural Cycles have received FDA clearance after a proof-of-concept study to integrate ‘wearables’ into the app. Essentially, a little wearable thermometer that will continuously monitor your temperature and other body signals to help protect you from pregnancy by accurately tracking when you ovulate from your temperature curve. This is great news for people who may have been previously put off the method due to how meticulous you need to be with manual tracking, sign up to their waitlist for further updates!\nYou may or may not have also heard of Coso, which won the James Dyson Award in 2021 for its clever design. It’s a reversible male contraceptive that essentially heats up testicles using ultrasound waves through water. Simply turn it on, wait for it to heat to the right temperature, and sit for a few minutes with your testicles dipped into it. Sounds… relaxing? The design is based on research that found ultrasound contraception has been successful on animals, but it’s not been tested on humans, so don’t hold your breath just yet.\nSmart RISUG is another reversible non hormonal male contraceptive that research has shown to be a promising alternative. Similar to a vasectomy, RISUG works by injecting non-hormonal chemicals to partially block the sperm duct and deactivate sperm before they leave the body.\nIf you think one of the many methods of non hormonal contraception that are currently available may work for you, you can always book an appointment with one of our lovely team of women’s health doctors for further support and advice. Or, if you’d like to directly compare either of these methods, try our contraception comparison tool to see the data side by side, including side effects, benefits and effectiveness.\n\n\n\n\nGeorgia is our resident content know-it-all.

        "Title": "Menopause and contraception in your 40s and 50s",
        "Content": "👀 If you think you’ll find this blog interesting, make sure to check out our newsletter:\n\nWe have a rising number of women and people with vaginas aged over 45 in the UK (11 million in 2011), therefore the conversation surrounding menopause and contraception needs to be prevalent. You may be thinking: “why would I need to think about contraception in my 40’s and 50’s”? The answer starts with what the menopause is, and how it works.\n\nThe menopause is medically defined as when a woman, or person with a uterus, over the age of 45 has not had a period for 12 months. The perimenopause refers to the time during which your body makes the natural transition to menopause, which can last up to 5 years or longer. As oestrogen levels decline during this process, it is normal to experience physical and emotional changes. Lower oestrogen levels can cause the vagina to lose muscle tissue, leading to vaginal dryness and pain during sex. Other physical changes include hot flushes, night sweats, insomnia, headaches and urinary incontinence. Decreasing hormone levels can also cause emotional changes, such as irritability, sadness, anxiety, fatigue, difficulty concentrating and even aggressiveness. In fact, it can feel like you are in a constant state of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), which can be pretty emotionally exhausting.\n\nThe good news is, there are medical treatments that can safely reduce these side effects. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can physcially replace the missing oestrogen and therefore help allievate symptoms of menopause, while water-based lubricants, vaginal moisturizers, and even laser therapy(!) can ease symptoms associated with vaginal dryness. However, contraception also plays a very important role for women in their 40s and 50s. Contraception is not only crucial to prevent pregnancy during this time, the synthetic hormones (if you use hormonal methods) can also ease multiple symptoms of the menopause.\nWhy is contraception relevant for women in their 40s and 50s?\nWhilst men continue to produce sperm into old age, women have a finite number of eggs at birth and the quantity declines with each complete (or missed due to contraception!) menstrual cycle. When women reach their 40’s and 50’s, they start the transition into stopping menstruation and releasing eggs altogether, otherwise known as the menopause. Within the UK population, the average age of the natural menopause is 51 years; however, menstrual cycle irregularity due to erratic hormone levels can occur 4 to 5 years or longer before periods stop completely (the perimenopause).\n\nIt may be tempting to stop using contraception in your 40’s and 50’s with the assumption that your fertility has reduced to the point that you no longer need it. However, you still have a 10-20% chance of getting pregnant at this time in your life, and pregnancies that do occur after 40 years have a significantly greater risk of adverse outcomes for both mother and child. The result? You are advised to continue using contraception until you are menopausal. In reality this means you can safely stop contraception:\n\nTwo years after your last period if you are aged 40 to 50\nOne year after your last period if you are aged over 50\nOr if you are over the age of 55 when the natural loss of fertility can be assumed (pregnancy over the age of 55 is extremely rare even if women are still having periods)\n\n\nIs your contraception masking symptoms of the menopause?\nBut this raises an important caveat. We know that contraception doesn’t kickstart menopause or have any effect on its timeline, but what if the contraceptive you are using is masking the symptoms of your last period?\n\nThose who use the hormonal coil (e.g. Mirena), may experience amenorrhoea (stopped periods), so in that case how would you know if you had gone through menopause? Measuring the hormone levels in the blood with a simple blood test (expecting Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) levels to rise and oestrogen levels to fall) is one option for people using progestogen-only methods over the age of 50. In this case, if the FSH levels are raised, women can stop contraception 1 year later without need to retest.\n\nThose using combined hormonal contraception (pills, patch or vaginal ring) or HRT have suppressed levels of certain hormones (estradiol and gonadotrophins); therefore testing is not recommended as it does not give any accurate information. Those using non-hormonal contraception will experience the symptoms and signs of menopause in the same way as someone not using any contraception and therefore do not need blood tests for diagnosis.\n\nSo why do we talk so much about the importance of contraception for women in their 40s and 50s? Well, the fact is, contraception has uses far beyond birth control! For women in their 40s and 50s especially, the relief from the symptoms of the menopause, along with therapeutic benefits in relation to health and disease, render contraception a pivotal part of the women’s health conversation as we get older.\n\nHowever, as women age they have an increased risk of some health conditions (which we’ll discuss in a moment). This means that choosing appropriate contraception requires an understanding of the health benefits and risks of each method, and the non-contraceptive advantages and disadvantages for this age group. Below are the three main uses of contraception for women in their 40s and 50s.\n\nContraception as…contraception!\nAn unplanned pregnancy at an older age can be devastating, and can present difficult choices. However, choosing your contraceptive method needs to be considered carefully, taking into account the associated health risks.\n\nAbove 50, there is a concern regarding the risks associated with combined hormonal contraception (due to the increased background risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, and breast and gynaecological cancers at this age) and so switching to a safer alternative is advised. Use of the contraceptive injection, including Sayana Press, is also associated with a small decrease in bone mineral density which can increase the risk of osteoporosis, a risk that increases as you get older anyway. Check out our guide to the injection for more info on this. Therefore, if you are over 40 and using the injection, you should be reviewed regularly to assess the benefits and risks. Those over 50 should consider alternative methods of contraception.\n\nSome contraceptives can be continued for longer in this age group. Extended use of hormonal coil (e.g. Mirena) until age 55 is supported if inserted at 45 years or older, and the copper coil can also be left in until menopause when inserted aged 40 or over.\n\nContraception as…symptom control!\nAs earlier described, perimenopause brings along a series of erratic hormonal changes which can be very unpleasant for some: changing bleeding patterns, loss of libido, and vaginal dryness to name a few. Combined hormonal contraception (pills, patch and vaginal ring), the hormonal coil and sometimes other progestogen-based methods (progestogen-only pills, the injection and implant) can reduce menstrual bleeding and pain, which may be particularly relevant for those over 40 who may be embarking on the perimenopause.\n\nThe pill, patch or vaginal ring can be used in eligible women under 50 as an alternative to HRT for relief of menopausal symptoms and prevention of bone mineral density loss, as they replace the oestrogen that is no longer produced after menopause. The loss of ‘bone mineral density’ is a concern as it increases the risk of fractures and bone pain.\nContraception as… part of hormonal replacement therapy (HRT)!\nHormonal treatment for menopausal symptoms is known as hormonal replacement therapy (aka HRT). This means we replace the oestrogen that is no longer produced in order to improve symptoms of the menopause such as vaginal dryness and hot flushes. However, oestrogen replacement alone has been shown to be associated with a significant increase in endometrial cancer risk, due to its effect on the womb lining. Therefore, anyone with a womb must also use progestogen alongside oestrogen HRT. This is because progestogen opposes the oestrogen-driven changes that can lead to cancer.\n\nThe Mirena coil has been licensed to provide endometrial protection alongside oestrogen HRT as it releases progestogen. We mentioned earlier that extended use of hormonal coil (e.g. Mirena) until age 55 is supported if inserted at 45 years or older for contraception purposes; however, if it is being used as the progestogen component of HRT, it must be changed every 5 years in order for the progestogen dose to remain high enough to protect the womb lining.\nWhat about other methods of contraception?\nWe have discussed a large range of contraceptives in this blog, but what about the other remaining methods: sterilisation, natural family planning and barrier methods?\n\nDuring sterilisation, the fallopian tubes are blocked or sealed, preventing eggs from being able to physically reach the sperm and be fertilised. Sterilisation does not mean removal of the uterus (hysterectomy) or ovaries (oopherectomy) and thus has no effect on hormones or symptoms of the menopause. It is worth noting that because sterilisation does not alter or eliminate menstrual periods, bleeding patterns may change after sterilisation if you also stop using a contraceptive method that was impacting on your bleeding pattern.\n\nWe also asked Sarah Panzetta, a Fertility UK fertility awareness practitioner about using natural family planning methods when approaching the menopause. She said: “Over 40 it can be more difficult to learn and use fertility awareness (natural family planning). This is because your fertility indicators (cycle length, waking temperature and cervical fluid) gradually become less reliable as menopause approaches. Some women will go ahead anyway, others might get a coil, or have a partner that decides this is a good time to get a vasectomy. If you take HRT you can’t use fertility awareness because it makes your fertility indicators unreliable”.\n\nBarrier methods (condoms, caps and diaphragms) are useful forms of contraception in women in their 40s and 50s. Condoms protect against sexually transmitted infections and are often used reliably; however they do not offer any symptomatic benefit for menopause as they do not contain any hormones.\n\nAnd there we have it! If used in the right ways, contraception has the potential to be your best friend. Don’t hesitate to contact your healthcare professional for further advice, or make an appointment with one of The Lowdown’s friendly team of women’s health GPs to discuss your contraceptive options during the menopause and perimenopause.\n\nIn summary…\n\nYou still have a 10-20% chance of getting pregnant in your 40’s and 50’s, so should consider contraception as part of family planning\nHRT is not a contraceptive method, but can be used alongside progestogen-only or non-hormonal contraception safely\nCombined hormonal contraception can be used in eligible women under 50 as an alternative to HRT for relief of menopausal symptoms and prevention of bone mineral density loss\nContraception and HRT can work together to ease the effects of menopause while protecting you from pregnancy and unwanted adverse effects of unopposed oestrogen HRT\n\nHayley Johnson is a junior doctor passionate about improving education and empowering women to make informed decisions their own contraception.

        "Title": "Period poo: The ins and the outs",
        "Content": "\nAre you sitting comfortably? People are pretty open about periods and menstruation these days, but one area that is still perhaps quite taboo is period poo. It’s something everyone with a uterus has probably experienced – some love it (#OddlySatisfying), some hate it.\nPerhaps it’s not widely talked about due to fears of being the only one who experiences it, but actually, it’s extremely common. One study reported that 73% of those who menstruate have experienced period-related gastrointestinal symptoms.\nHow can you explain to someone what a period poo is like? Well, even though most of us can relate, each poo is personal and unique so no experience would be the same. So, why do we have period poos and can we do anything about it? Here’s the lowdown…\nCan’t stop, won’t stop – why do I poop so much?!\nIncreased muscle contractions\nIf you’re someone who seems to constantly be on the phone to nature when you’re on your period then you probably have prostaglandins to thank. Just before menstruation, the body releases these hormones which stimulate muscle contractions in the uterus, helping the body to shed the uterus lining. Prostaglandin has a similar effect on other muscles in the body, including intestines and bowels, which subsequently is why we form much more poo during our periods. This can be quite uncomfortable, and is why we may have stomach cramps that differ from uterus (classic period pain) cramps during this time. This is particularly rife with those who struggle with irritable bowel disease or Crohn’s diseases, and often makes their symptoms a lot worse.\nIncreased progesterone\nAnother hormone that you’re probably more familiar with is progesterone, which increases just before the start of a period. For some unlucky people, progesterone can also cause constipation before or during their period. This can worsen symptoms for people who already have irritable bowel syndrome and those who may be prone to constipation.\nProgesterone can also cause food to move around more slowly through the intestine, causing a sort of food traffic jam and thus, making you constipated. It acts as a muscle relaxant and decreases contractions in the bowels, making everything slow down.\nDietary changes\nThere may be dietary changes which happen around your period which can affect your digestive system. Although there is little scientific evidence about how foods we eat might affect us around our period, we do know fruit, fibre and vegetables are good for gut movements but comfort foods might not be so good. Have a look at what you eat around your period and whether there are things included that might make you feel more bloated and constipated.\nIncreased stress or anxiety\nRight before your period (or during), anxiety levels might also rise which can be a symptom of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Most people experience some level of PMS during their period, some more severely than others. As if low moods weren’t enough, these emotions can also affect your bathroom schedule and may either increase bowel movements or cause constipation. According to research, people also report greater sensitivity to pain and discomfort in the premenstrual phase as well as on their periods.\nIs there anything that helps?\n\nMake sure you are eating lots of fibre-filled foods in and around your period. These should help keep the bowels moving and could hopefully make your poos that little bit easier to handle during menstruation\nMoving around can help to ease bloating and discomfort and helps keep the bowel active\nUsing ibuprofen or other anti-inflammatories can help to reduce cramping and the prostaglandin hormones which lead to discomfort\nCoffee might also increase your risk of getting diarrhoea, so cutting back on it during your period is advised as it can sometimes act as a laxative \nAll hormonal contraception methods help to avoid the hormonal fluctuations that can trigger the conditions for period poops.\n\nShould I change my tampon?\nChanging your tampon is not essential when you have a poo… However, faeces can contain harmful bacteria which can cause vaginal infections if it accidentally gets on the tampon string.\nTo avoid this, try holding the string to the front or side to avoid getting poo on it, or slightly tuck it behind the labia.\nThere is a condition called toxic shock syndrome which can be caused by a range of different things but one risk factor is leaving your tampon in longer than you should. It is caused by bacteria which overwhelms your system and can make you really unwell.\nTo prevent risk of infection when using a tampon, we recommend washing your hands before inserting or removing, avoid getting faeces on the string, try to change regularly (depends on the brand but usually every 4-8 hours) and try to use a fresh tampon overnight.\nOne thing for sure with period poo is that you’re not alone. Try bringing up the subject with your pals (if you don’t do so already) and they will probably all be able to relate.\n\nDr Becky is part of The Lowdown’s medical team.

        "Title": "The Natural Cycles app &#8211; how does it work?",
        "Content": "\n20 years ago the idea of being able to have everything you could ever need on one smart device in your pocket was pretty mind-blowing. And now, this includes your contraception.The Natural Cycles app is a downloadable form of digital contraception derived from the symptothermal method, which falls under the umbrella of fertility awareness methods (FAM). Fertility awareness or natural family planning means learning to identify when you are fertile and then avoiding sex or using condoms during that window, to prevent pregnancy.\nWhat is the Natural Cycles app?\nNatural Cycles, which is CE marked in Europe and FDA cleared in the US, is powered by an algorithm that analyses your temperature (measured using a thermometer) and menstrual cycle data to calculate when you are fertile – advising you to use other protection such as condoms, or avoid sex on fertile days. To make the app easy and simple to use, days where it is safe to have unprotected sex appear as ‘green days’, whereas ‘red days’ warn you that you are likely to be fertile and therefore may fall pregnant if you have unprotected sex.This form of contraception could be classified as a method of natural family planning, with a modern update. Natural Cycles falls under ‘digital contraception’, using intuitive algorithms to predict your cycle and make it easier for you to get clued up on what’s going on inside your body. All you have to do is open the app and your logged data is stored for you – leaving less room for error (and less manual work) in comparison to traditional FAM.\nHow does Natural Cycles work?\nThe Natural Cycles algorithm identifies when you ovulate and thereby calculates your red and green days. It does this by analysing:\n\nYour temperature data (throughout the menstrual cycle your temperature rises and falls slightly, which is due to the change in the body’s hormone levels)\nYour menstrual cycle length (taking fluctuations and cycle irregularities into account)\nYour optional luteinising hormone (LH) test results (LH level surges just before you ovulate). An LH test, or ovulation test, is done with a urine test strip, which you can buy at your local pharmacy or through the Natural Cycles app.\n\nHow long does Natural Cycles take to work?\nWhilst the app will predict your fertile and non-fertile windows immediately, you may get more red days until the algorithm has gotten to know your unique cycle. The number of green days will increase as the algorithm gets to know your cycle, which usually takes 1-3 cycles. On red days, you will need to use protection such as condoms, or abstain from sex altogether.\nNatural Cycles effectiveness\nNatural Cycles has been shown to be 93% effective with typical use, and 98% effective with perfect use (perfect use means not having unprotected sex on red days, and if using condoms using these consistently and correctly). This rate has been shown by four separate peer reviewed clinical studies (linked in our references section below). This effectiveness rating is also determined by the company’s ongoing monitoring of effectiveness rates that they are required to do as an FDA (US Food & Drug administration) cleared medical device.When comparing Natural Cycles to the clinical effectiveness of other contraceptives with perfect use, it is less effective than long-term methods such as the implant, IUDs and sterilisation, but potentially more effective than barrier methods such as female condoms, the diaphragm and cap.In comparison to The Lowdown’s most popular contraceptives, the combined pill is 99.7% effective with perfect use, and the hormonal coil (IUS) is 99.8% effective. With typical use the combined pill is around 92% effective, which is similar to Natural Cycles.Of course, the big attraction of Natural Cycles for lots of people is that it is a non-hormonal method. So, let’s compare it to other non hormonal contraceptives; with perfect use, the copper coil (IUD) and ballerine IUB methods are both 99.4% effective. A benefit of these methods, especially when compared to Natural Cycles, is that they are long lasting, and you don’t have to remember to use them every day.Other methods of non-hormonal contraception include the vasectomy (99.9% effective with perfect use) and female sterilisation (99.5% effective with perfect use). These methods are considered permanent (occasionally vasectomies can be reversed), so are not an option for someone who would wish to conceive in the future.\nHow well does Natural Cycles work as contraception?\nMost of the stats above relate to perfect use – meaning when contraception is always used correctly as it was intended, for example, taking your pill at the same time each day. We tend to favour looking at typical use, as it factors in how contraceptives will be used in the real world. For example, not taking your pill on time, or having your repeat injection slightly late. Natural Cycle’s typical use effectiveness rating is on par with the both combined and mini pills, the patch and the vaginal ring (all 92-93%). With all of these methods, it is down to the user to make sure they are being as efficient and effective as possible. Whether that’s knowing what counts as a missed pill, when to change the patch or how to properly insert a vaginal ring. With Natural Cycles, you must abstain from sex on red days if you want to use the app perfectly, or if using condoms on red days make sure you use these consistently and correctly.If you are using condoms on red fertile days you are relying on the effectiveness of condoms for your contraception. There are a few things that can stop a condom from working. The most common thing is that the condom breaks, splits or slips off during sex. It may also not be effective if its used with oil based products, medication for things like thrush, stored in intense heat or cold, or past its use by date. If these things happen, you use a condom incorrectly, or you don’t use a condom on red days, you should consider emergency contraception.Studies have shown unintended pregnancies do occur whilst using Natural Cycles, but these results match up with the published effectiveness rates mentioned above, and it is important to remember no contraceptive method is 100% effective.  \nHow to get started with Natural Cycles\nNatural Cycles is really easy to use and can be set up in three simple steps:\n\nMeasure – begin by measuring your temperature at roughly the same time every morning, it’s advised that this is done at least five out of seven days of the week (otherwise it will result in more red days)\nEnter your data – enter your temperature into the app. You can also log period data, your emotions, sex drive and physical symptoms to help the algorithm predict how your body reacts to your different cycle stages\nDetermine your fertility status – the algorithm in the app is able to confirm your ovulation to determine your fertile ‘window,’ letting you know if you are on a ‘red’ or ‘green’ day\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Natural Cycles thermometer\nThe Natural Cycles thermometer isn’t a typical thermometer as it is highly specific – it’s called a basal thermometer. It will measure your basal body temperature (your lowest resting body temperature) within two decimal places, which is required to confirm ovulation. The thermometer is used in the morning when you wake up to let you know whether it’s a green day (not fertile) or a red day (fertile).You can purchase the Natural Cycles basal thermometer for £10 directly from their website, and it should arrive within 1-3 business days. Lowdown readers can receive 15% off an annual Natural Cycles subscription and a free thermometer using this link (or the code LOWDOWN15)!**FYI – this is an affiliate link, which means The Lowdown will earn a commission on any purchases made.\nNatural Cycles and the Oura Ring\nNatural Cycles have now partnered with ŌURA, makers of the Oura Ring; a smart ring connected to an app showing your health insights, such as heart rate and sleep quality. Essentially just like a smart watch. The Oura Ring works by syncing temperature trend data straight from the ring to your Natural Cycles app, allowing you to track your temperature automatically whilst sleeping, rather than manually taking your temperature with the basal thermometer when you wake up.The temperature sensors in the Oura Ring generate 1,440 data points each day, and are validated to measure temperature changes as precisely as 0.13°C. In addition to this temperature trend data, the Natural Cycles algorithm uses heart rate data from the Oura Ring to take into account nights with elevated heart rates (which can raise body temperature) that may be due to lifestyle changes that aren’t due to menstrual cycle changes, such as consuming more alcohol.\nNatural Cycles pros and cons\nAdvantages of Natural Cycles\n\nIt’s a form of ‘natural planning’ contraception that allows you to better understand your cycle\nIf you want to get pregnant then you are already aware of your most fertile ‘window’ which can help you to conceive more easily\nIt is a non-hormonal contraception method and therefore does not have the potential side effects associated with hormonal contraception\n\nDisadvantages of Natural Cycles\n\nYou may want to use extra protection as the app gets to know your unique cycle\nWhile you can use Natural Cycles if you have an irregular cycle, you may experience more red days\nYou may forget to take your temperature, which will result in more red days \nThere is a subscription fee, as opposed to alternative contraception methods available in the UK which are free on the NHS\n\nWho should use Natural Cycles?\n\nYou must be over 18 years old\nPeople unable to use other types of contraception due to medical conditions\nThose wanting a form of contraception that doesn’t affect their periods\nThose that are able to (and will remember to) take their temperature every morning\nThose happy to abstain from sex or use other forms of contraception on red days\n\nWho shouldn’t use it?\n\nPeople constantly traveling to different time zones or who have an irregular sleeping pattern\nPeople who want a method that will stop or lighten their periods\nThose that don’t want a form of contraception that needs to be used daily\nThose wanting the most (almost 100%) effective protection against pregnancy\nThose wanting a form of contraception that also offers protection from sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\n\nClick here to take the Natural Cycles quiz and see if their temperature app is the right method for you.\nHow to stop using Natural Cycles\nTo stop using the app, all you need to do is stop recording your periods and temperatures. Theoretically, Natural Cycles should have no side effects. Check out the Lowdown’s reviews to see what others have experienced.\nWhere can I get the Natural Cycles app?\nYou can start using Natural Cycles as contraception by purchasing a monthly or annual subscription through the app (downloaded via the App Store or Google Play). An annual subscription includes a two decimal basal thermometer, which you will need in order to use Natural Cycles; but if you happen to have a decimal basal thermometer lying about then you can get started straight away!If not, whilst waiting for the thermometer to arrive, you can try using Natural Cycles in demo mode to have a play around and get a feel for the app. Before getting started, be sure to read the user manual, which contains all the information you will need to get the most out of Natural Cycles.\nHow much does Natural Cycles cost?\nAn annual membership for Natural Cycles costs £59.99 with a thermometer included, or £8.99 per month with a £10 cost for the thermometer.Lowdown readers can receive 20% off an annual Natural Cycles subscription AND a free thermometer via the link below!Claim your Natural Cycles discount here.* *FYI – This is an affiliate link.\nCan you get Natural Cycles on the NHS?\nCurrently you’re unable to get the Natural Cycles app on the NHS.\nApp alternatives to Natural Cycles\nWhile there are loads of period trackers on the market, it’s important to note that Natural Cycles is the only app intended to be used as contraception in both Europe (CE Marked) and the US (FDA Cleared). \nNatural Cycles vs. Flo\nWorking in a similar way to Natural Cycles, you can use Flo to track your menstrual cycle and fertile window, and even log what contraception method you use – this will change the app’s predictions as some hormonal contraceptives will stop you ovulating. Flo Premium costs £8.99 a month, while Natural Cycles costs £6.99 a month. There is a free version of Flo, with limited access to features.\nNatural Cycles vs. Clue\nMuch like Flo, Clue is also a period tracking app. Clue’s tracker allows you to track emotions, physical symptoms and has the option to track your pregnancy too. This year Clue will be launching an FDA cleared birth control app.\nNatural Cycles vs. Daysy\nDaysy is a German-made fertility app, rather than a birth control app. It works in the same way as Natural Cycles, but Daysy has a flat fee of €289 vs. a monthly subscription.\nNatural Cycles reviews\nThousands of women have shared their contraceptive experiences on The Lowdown.

        "Title": "The Lowdown on HPV: Your questions answered",
        "Content": "\nTLDR… what’s the lowdown?\n\nHPV is a common virus, basically like a cold. 80% of us will have it at some point in our lives. Anyone can get it. There are loads of different types of HPV known as ‘strains’; some types are known to cause abnormal cells in the cervix, which can over time lead to cervical cancer, while other types can cause warts\nHPV can be passed on through any sexual contact (with the genital area), and is therefore sometimes unhelpfully referred to as a sexually transmitted infection (STI). However, it is not the same as STIs like chlamydia or gonorrhoea. It’s impossible to fully prevent and can be passed on even during protected sex\nThere’s nothing to be ashamed of when receiving a positive HPV result (or a positive STI result for that matter!)\nThe HPV virus can lie dormant in your system for years, so if you’re in a monogamous relationship it doesn’t mean someone’s had a wandering eye – either of you could have caught it beforehand and it’s almost impossible to tell from who and when this might have happened\nWatch back the full event recording of our webinar with Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust here.\n\nWhat is HPV?\nHPV is a common virus that can affect the cervix, lining of the mouth and throat, the vagina, vulva and anus. There are over 200 known types of HPV, and the jab offered in schools protects against a few of these. HPV is categorised into two main types – low-risk and high-risk. Most types of HPV are low-risk, may not cause any symptoms, or simply appear as minor warts on your hands, feet or genitals.\nHigh-risk HPV is linked to some cancers, which is why it is routinely screened for in cervical smears in the UK. Remember, even if your results do show high-risk HPV, your body will usually work to get rid of it and it will clear up on its own without any issues. Most people are HPV negative in 2 years, and you probably wouldn’t have even known you had it if you hadn’t gone for a screening.\nIf it’s so common, why do they screen for it?\n99% of cervical cancers are caused by persistent infection of high-risk HPV, hence why it’s the first thing they screen for. Cervical screening tests aren’t a test FOR cancer, they’re simply an efficient way to ensure that any high-risk HPV is monitored and any pesky abnormal cell changes are caught early. While most people will have HPV at some point in their life, keeping an eye on your cervix with regular screening helps to ensure those precancerous cells don’t get the chance to develop into cervical cancer.\nIf your screening results come back every time as HPV positive, this also doesn’t necessarily mean you will develop cervical cancer. You’ll be invited for screenings either once a year, every 6 months or even 3 months, and be asked to attend a colposcopy screening if your smears show cell changes, or as a routine procedure if you have had HPV for 3 smears in a row (more on this later).\nDoes it impact men / do I need to tell my partner?\nA review of thirteen studies exploring women’s concerns about disclosing HPV to a sexual partner showed three main themes: the anticipated psychological impact of disclosure and fears of rejection, if disclosure was even really necessary, and how to manage disclosure.\nWhen it comes to sex, as HPV isn’t like other STIs – which we can test for and treat – it’s not necessary to tell your partner if you have it. However you may want to discuss your HPV result with your partner. It’s important to remember that condoms don’t necessarily prevent you from getting HPV as the virus is passed on through skin to skin contact with the genitals. So, if you bring it up – make sure you can give them the facts: 80% of us will get it, they probably have it or have had it already without knowing, and the only way you can avoid it is by avoiding sex altogether for the rest of your life. Basically, it’s NBD for a lot of us.\nCan you get it again if it’s gone away?\nAccording to Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust, while there is still more research needed about HPV reinfection between couples, the current evidence suggests that natural immunity to HPV and developing a response to the virus that would protect against reinfection is low. This means that there is a possibility that reinfection between couples could happen. HPV may also stay in the body but be dormant – meaning it is not picked up on a test. It can then become active again – meaning a test will then show a positive result.\nIs there anything I can do to stop getting HPV?\nThe HPV vaccine normally consists of two jabs and is routinely offered to girls and boys aged 12 to 13 in secondary schools. If you missed out at school but are under 25 you can still have your jabs for free on the NHS through school or your GP surgery. It’s also available to pay for privately if you missed out. The HPV vaccine is also available for men who have sex with men up to the age of 45 and some transgender people are eligible for the vaccine. Check out the NHS advice on eligibility here. It’s worth noting if you’re over 15 you’ll need three doses of the vaccine instead of two.\nThe vaccine doesn’t protect against all types of HPV, but is effective at protecting against some types, reducing cervical cell changes, and reducing the risk of some cancers including cervical cancer. Condoms may also reduce your risk of HPV but do not completely protect against it. If you have HPV, just like trying to fight off any cold or virus, it’s recommended that you try to keep leading a healthy, balanced lifestyle, and quit smoking (a major risk factor for cervical cancer and a weakened immune system). This gives your immune system a leg up to clearing it off sooner. If you REALLY don’t want to get HPV, never have sex or touch another human being. Ever.\nAre there any symptoms I should look out for?\nWhile HPV is symptomless for many people, if you receive a positive HPV result on your cervical screening test and are told to come back in a year, you may also be told to look out for bleeding after sex or between periods. There are many reasons you may experience irregular bleeding patterns, especially if you are using hormonal contraception, and it’s not likely to be cancer.\nHowever if you are experiencing persistent bleeding after sex or between periods you should be examined by your GP, whether or not you’ve had a positive HPV result. It’s important to note there is a tiny proportion of cervical cancers that cannot be prevented through cervical screening and cervical screening is not for people with symptoms. If you are worried about symptoms, see your GP for an examination.\nOur handy guide to spotting whilst on contraception and when to see a doctor about it will save you many a late night panic Google.\nWhat is the process for cervical screening?\nIf you own a cervix in the UK you will be invited for a cervical screening (previously called a smear test. A routine cervical screening test usually takes 5-10 minutes, in which you undress from the waist down and lie on an examination bed. The nurse will gently insert a speculum into your vagina to open the cervix, and then take a sample of cells with a small brush.\nThe frequency of cervical screenings is based on your level of risk.\n\nIf no HPV is found, you’ll be invited for screening in England every 3 years aged 25-49, or every 5 years if you’re aged 50-64. In Scotland and Wales, you’re invited for a screening every 5 years, whatever your age.\nIf HPV is found, but you have no cell changes, you’re invited back in 1 year to check if the HPV has cleared. If you get this result 3 times in a row, you will be invited for a colposcopy.\nIf HPV is found and you have cell changes, you will be invited for a colposcopy for further tests.\n\n\n     View this post on Instagram\nA post shared by The Lowdown (@get.the.lowdown)\n\nA colposcopy is a follow up to a cervical screening, and is a pretty similar set up – say hello again to our old friend the speculum. The colposcopist will take a closer look at your cervix (so can you FYI, they put it on a screen) using a magnifying lens to see what’s what, putting some iodine on the cervix to allow any abnormalities to stand out. They may take a small biopsy there and then if they notice any changes.\nIf your cervical screening result comes back positive, or your colposcopy shows abnormal cell changes, don’t panic. Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust has excellent resources and support for those wanting more information after a positive result.\nWhat is LLETZ?\nLarge loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) is a type of surgery that removes a small part of the cervix using a thin wire loop with an electrical current. It can be used to treat abnormal cells or early stage cervical cancer, as well as for cervical cancer diagnosis.\nDoes HPV impact fertility or pregnancy?\nHPV has no effect on fertility, whether you want to try for a baby, or if you are pregnant.\nIf you are pregnant and due to have cervical screening, you’ll usually be advised to wait for 12 weeks after giving birth as it can be more difficult to get clear results during pregnancy. Some women may be advised to have cervical screening at an antenatal appointment and if needed colposcopy can be done safely during pregnancy. When it comes to giving birth, vertical transmission (from mother to baby during vaginal delivery) of HPV is known to occur but the risk is low and babies usually clear the virus on their own.\nWhen it comes to the effects that LLETZ treatment can have on childbirth, it is dependent on the type of treatment you received and the extent. Only about 2% of people who become pregnant after LLETZ will give birth prematurely. Giving birth prematurely is more likely if you have had LLETZ more than once or had more than 10mm of your cervix removed (which is not common in LLETZ treatment).\nIs there any link between the pill and HPV?\nStudies have consistently reported a small increased risk of cervical cancer associated with using the combined pill. This risk decreases with time after stopping. Among those with persistent HPV infection, use of the combined pill for more than 5 years may increase the risk of cervical cancer. Overall this risk is very low whether you’ve used the pill for a long time or not. This risk is similar with the implant and injection, however, research hasn’t found any increased risk of cervical cancer associated with the progestogen only pill. Although more research needs to be done looking at HPV and contraception use, we do know that keeping up with cervical screening mitigates this risk.\nIt’s important to know that if you have an HPV positive result from your cervical screening you can happily continue your contraception including the combined pill, patch or ring. Cervical cancer is not driven by hormones. Therefore, in the case of someone diagnosed with cervical cancer, the benefits of combined hormonal contraception are still considered to outweigh the risks of unplanned pregnancy, so you are able to continue with this method.\nWatch back the full event recording of our webinar with Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust here.\nGeorgia is our resident content know-it-all.

        "Title": "World Contraception Day 2021: What we’ve learnt from The Lowdown over the last year",
        "Content": "\nFor those of you who don’t know I’m a GP by background and alongside the lovely Dr Fran I am one of the Lowdown’s Medical Directors. It was lovely to see all your faces at our WCD event, especially after remote consulting for 18 months, and getting the chance to meet some of you who’ve had appointments with us, worked on our content, or helped to build our amazing community. By the time you read this we’ve probably learnt even more about these topics so be sure to check out our blogs and event pages for more insights!\n\nDr Becky, Dr Mel and CTO Marija\nThe Lowdown on medical research and contraception \nWe’ve all realised how traditional research has its limitations – you have to have large studies that are rigorously designed to be valid and its slow. Research on contraception and women’s health can be difficult.  Hormones and hormonal contraception are complex areas of science with contradictory effects on the body which are also ethically tricky to study. It also takes time for new research and emerging evidence to filter through to the medical community and to become accepted practice.\nThis doesn’t quite fit our fast paced tech age and there’s a tension there. If there’s new advances in medical knowledge, clued up contraception users want to know about them, maybe even before this filters through to medical practice. But the medical community tends to be more cautious and it takes time to change the status quo.\nWe as health professionals and users of contraception have to recognise this tension exists and work with it. This is where The Lowdown excels. Rather than turning to Mumsnet forums, contraception users can research the evidence and discuss their experiences all in one place. We as doctors have to learn to interpret evidence alongside our patients and share the limitations of research honestly – which is what we’ve been trying to do with contraception at The Lowdown.\nThrough this we’ve learnt and are still learning what’s important to women and users of contraception, where the status quo does not address this and what’s important we focus on for the future. I’m going to talk about how The Lowdown has grown to embody and fight for this and share with you some examples of how our community has educated us in all things women’s health!\nD-Mannose and UTIs\nWe did a Sunday surgery with the wonderful @selfcaredoctor Dr Masarat about urine infections, aka UTIs, and we were inundated by lots of you telling us all about D-mannose, a sugar that is available to buy as powder or tablets; and is not a medicine, but which many of you had found helped with keeping recurrent UTIs at bay.\nThere are a small number of studies on a small number of people showing promising results for D-mannose in UTI prevention. With results better than placebo and likely equal to antibiotics, and few side effects, it is now recommended by bodies such as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and Public Health England as a self care option non pregnant women may wish to try.\nWe’re awaiting the results of an Oxford university Randomised Controlled Trial (gold standard study) to evaluate whether D-mannose helps women suffering with recurrent UTI presenting to their GP and its cost effectiveness.\n\nPaused egg syndrome\nWe ran an online event on Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) with world-leading reproductive health expert, Professor Colin Duncan, a few months ago. The event was fascinating and we learned that PCOS doesn’t cause cysts, but actually hormonal imbalances cause eggs to pause in their development and these look like cysts on an ultrasound scan. For the most common reproductive disorder in the world, it’s really an overlooked fact!\nIt was also interesting to hear about his tests on sheep which are showing that the condition may be caused by exposure to excess testosterone before we are born. And whilst we have been lacking evidence that PCOS by itself can cause weight gain, or that having PCOS makes weight loss difficult or impossible, Prof Duncan’s research on sheep shows that PCOS may affect insulin signalling in such a way that burning of calories is more difficult. Something which resonated with many of you and really makes us think about how little we know about hormones and metabolism!\nAll of our webinars are recorded, so you can watch it back at any time.\nCoils and pain on fitting\nIn the wake of Naga Munchetty and Caitlin Moran sharing their experiences of pain during coil fittings, you took to social media to tell us about your experiences. For most women the experience of having a coil fitted may be unpleasant and crampy but tolerable. For some women, however, the procedure can be excruciatingly painful and sadly lots of you reported undergoing painful coil fittings and some without pain relief.\nThe reasons for the variation in experience of pain are many but are usually fairly unpredictable. There is however strong evidence behind the value in offering pain relief. We looked at the research and found that only 25% of clinicians routinely use local anaesthetic when fitting coils, and 25% never use it. Lidocaine sprays and numbing creams have been proven to reduce pain significantly and in our opinion pain relief should be routinely offered to everyone being fitted with a coil. Guidance for healthcare professionals has since been updated, but as we know changes take time to filter into practice so we have developed a guide for you!\nImportantly, greater anxiety, greater anticipated pain and negative perceptions of coils and coil fittings prior to the procedure appear to correlate with higher experienced pain scores in the research. We certainly don’t want to put anyone off getting an IUD as our review data shows that the Hormonal IUS and Copper IUD have the highest overall satisfaction rating of any contraceptive method. But it’s so important that we have access to the right information, advice and pain relief to make the fitting procedure more comfortable.\n\nDr Mel’s captivated audience\nWeird periods and covid vaccines \nAs a community that regularly discusses periods it didn’t take long for you to start telling us about changes to periods you’d noticed following the Covid-19 vaccine. In an Instagram poll over two thirds of you said yes you had noticed a correlation – with you noticing your periods have been heavier, longer, lighter, more painful, later, earlier, or unexpected. This was in line with women’s reports to the MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) through the yellow card side effect reporting scheme. Most people who report a change to their period after vaccination find that it returns to normal the following cycle and, importantly, there is no evidence that Covid-19 vaccination adversely affects fertility.\nWe teamed up with Dr Victoria Male to answer all your questions on Covid vaccines, periods and fertility in an online webinar which loads of you attended. We discussed how:\n\nChanges to periods are common but not widely talked about or recognised. Changes can result from a variety of factors including undiagnosed underlying medical or gynaecological conditions, but also other things we may not realise such as exposure to stress, excessive exercise, eating disorders, changes in weight, depression and acute and chronic illnesses. Media scrutiny and sheer numbers of vaccinated women world wide mean we are now talking about this.\nWhilst the number of reports of period irregularities and vaginal bleeding is low in relation to both the millions of people who have received Covid-19 vaccines to date and how common menstrual disorders are generally, it is plausible that in some people the immune response to vaccination can trigger temporary changes to periods.\nThe MHRA’s investigation and subsequent studies have been reactive as a result of women sharing experiences and expressing concern. We think this reflects a gender bias in clinical research trials and a lack of emphasis on the importance of reproductive health to women’s daily lives. The effects of medical interventions on periods should not be an afterthought in future research. This should also be a lesson on how we respond to the reporting of potential side effects, we must address what is important to women.  Vaccine hesitancy among young women is largely driven by false claims that Covid-19 vaccines could harm their chances of future pregnancy. Failing to thoroughly investigate reports of menstrual changes after vaccination is likely to fuel these fears.We’d like to see menstrual irregularities investigated as part of clinical trials so women can be made aware of potential side effects, or reassured that they are not linked, and so they can be prepared rather than anxious or worried. Clear and trusted information is particularly important for those who rely on being able to predict their menstrual cycles to either achieve or avoid pregnancy.\n\nWe are obsessed with fertility\nThe issue of contraception and long term effects on fertility comes up time and time again and is a myth that is perpetuated. As we’ve seen with Covid-19 vaccines, concerns about fertility and medical interventions are not just limited to contraception. The stress, anxiety, stigma, fear and shame surrounding infertility means it’s at least a subconscious worry for many women.\nWant the lowdown? Changes to periods are a common side effect of contraception, which does by its very nature, in the short term, affect your fertility to stop you getting pregnant. However in some women the benefits of contraceptive use, such as making periods less frequent or stopping them altogether, can mask an underlying problem that may affect fertility.\nOf all reversible methods of contraception only the injection has the potential to cause a short term delay in return to fertility for up to 12-18 months after stopping, with no significant difference in pregnancy rates 2 years after stopping.\nFor all other methods of reversible and hormonal contraception, fertility returns to what is normal for you as soon as you stop your method of contraception. Research supported by real world data from The Lowdown reviews, shows most women see a return of their periods to what is normal for them a few months after stopping. In order to tackle fears and stop the spread of harmful myths we’ve aimed to address your worries by including ‘effects on fertility after stopping’ for all the contraception methods on our website and of course writing an amazing blog all about it.\n\nMood\nMood change is one of the biggest concerns users of hormonal contraception have. And can impact on a woman’s decision to continue or even correctly use a contraceptive method. And we get it. For every woman who tells us their heavy periods or horrendous PMS has been helped by the pill, there is another woman who can tell us about her mood swings and anxiety. And the research on what effects to expect, or who might be affected is patchy, contradictory and scary.\nEven without experiencing a mood problem many women seek advice from us because they’ve heard about potential mood effects and having used contraception since their teenage years often say ‘I don’t know who I am off contraception’. Without good evidence, doctors have little to go on and little advice to give when considering options. Unfortunately this often translates into perceived dismissiveness by the medical profession.\nOur data is quite negatively biased with lots of women reporting negative changes to their mood with all sorts of contraception. We’re mindful that lots of this data has been collected over the last couple of years of pandemic life, and also reflects a community who is questioning their experiences. It might be that the hormonal effects of contraception on mood are a minor cog in the wheel, but also potentially a tipping point for some.\nIt’s unlikely we will get answers from traditional research which studies large numbers of people as there are so many confounding factors for individuals – age, genetics, medical history, relationships, life stressors, to name a few. This is an example of where sharing the limits of medical knowledge and addressing problems individually helps to manage uncertainty.\nWhy ‘back-to-backing’ your pill is not just that thing you did before your girls holiday to Zante in 2010\nThere are also areas where we want to see medical advice catch up with the evidence. Explaining to women you can take the combined pill continuously or with shorter breaks should be the norm. There is no medical reason for having a break on the combined pill and an associated bleed every month, although as always personal choice is a big factor. Taking your pill continuously can reduce associated problems like heavy or painful bleeding, PMS symptoms, headaches and the whole inconvenience of bleeding when you don’t have to. It is also likely to increase the effectiveness of the pill through reducing the risk of ovulation from a missed pill. Win-win.\nWhilst most medical professionals will be able to advise women of this benefit it still is not seen as the status quo. Until we change outdated prescription guidance and medication information leaflets to reflect this, women will still believe this is hearsay and may even think they are going against medical advice. We’ve created a guide to continuous pill taking as an authoritative source for women – read it to learn why periods on the pill aren’t ‘real’!\n‘Over the counter’ pills\nAt The Lowdown we were very happy to hear that a couple of months ago the MHRA made two, relatively unknown brands, of the very safe and highly effective desogestrel progestogen-only pill (POP) available over the counter (OTC) without a prescription. The option to buy the POP over the counter at pharmacies will be a convenient and easy choice for many, but unfortunately does not address the wider problem of access to free contraception and a choice of options for everyone that wants it.\nWe would like to see all brands of the desogestrel POP available without a prescription and free of charge from a wide range of services and settings. Lovima and Hana come at a higher price point than other pills and we must be careful not to add barriers to access for those who already find accessing contraception difficult, especially under the guise of removing them.\nWe would also like to ensure that women are able to access information and advice so they are fully informed of the potential and expected side effects of the POP, including for example, irregular bleeding, mood changes and acne. These common problems can lead to women stopping or changing contraceptives, or taking them incorrectly, and being vulnerable to unintended pregnancies.\nAt The Lowdown we strongly believe in reproductive autonomy for everyone and the development of more contraceptive options including a male contraceptive is an important step towards this. Individuals and couples should be able to decide on a contraceptive method that fits their lifestyle and needs, and the development of the male contraceptive will allow men to more actively participate in this.\nWe need to recognise the importance of personal choice and personal experience and the desire to seek out and learn from others with similar stories, as well as from traditional studies and research. The need for The Lowdown, as a space to voice this, to normalise and validate experiences, as a way to access a breadth of information AND individualised care, is overwhelming. In our experience encouraging nuanced conversations around the benefits and downsides of contraception empowers women to make informed positive choices, rather than discouraging contraception use as some might fear.\nFinally I just want to say how amazing and inspiring it is to work with such a passionate team and by extension a community of thousands of people who want to make each other’s lives better by improving women’s experiences of accessing and choosing contraception.

        "Content": "\nAlysia’s Story\nI was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease in 2013 when I was 21 years old. Pre-diagnosis, I had used the combined pill for contraception for a few years & had no issues. Like most people with IBD, my diagnosis was slow & difficult. I had no family history, so every step towards living life with IBD was a learning curve, from diet to medication & lifestyle – I was at rock bottom & to be honest, changing my contraception wasn’t on my radar. \nAfter around 6 months of steroid treatment & immunosuppression, my condition was starting to stabilise, I was starting to get back on track and gain weight. All of a sudden my periods stopped. It was the first time I realised that my IBD was impacting more than just my gut health & the battering my body had taken for the past year was causing additional problems. Although I was super organised with taking all my tablets, I was advised by my GP to change my contraception & opted for the Mirena Coil. I chose it because it was the lowest maintenance but I was warned it might cause stomach pain. I wasn’t worried as I knew it couldn’t be as worse as my Crohns… and it wasn’t – I never felt anything!\nOne less thing to worry about\nI have lived with IBD for nearly 10 years and there have been many ups & downs. The main advantage of having the coil is that it gives me one less thing to worry about – no extra tablets, no additional appointments (I can manage once every 8 years!), & I’ve never experienced any side effects. The procedure is quick and easy, compared to everything we have to go through with our IBD (colonoscopy prep!). And most importantly it gives me peace of mind, especially as my periods can be irregular as my weight fluctuates with big flare ups.\nFor more personal experiences to help you figure out what contraceptive is best for you, head over to our reviews. Leaving a review also helps others make informed decisions about choosing contraception.\n\n\n\nThis blog is a part of The Lowdown’s My Contraceptive Journey series.

        "Title": "IBS and the pill: best contraception for babes with digestive issues",
        "Content": "\n\nDigestive problems? Lets specify:\nHot babes can have all sorts of digestive issues, but two of the most common are Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Someone decided to make their names similar and they are easy to mix up so here’s the lowdown on their differences.\nIBS – Irritable Bowel Syndrome\nUsually when something is called a ‘syndrome’ – that means it’s a collection of symptoms, and each person can have some or all of those symptoms to varying degrees of severity. For IBS these symptoms come about because of your normal digestion being disrupted, such as:\n\nStomach cramps\nBloating \nDiarrhoea \nConstipation \n\nSometimes, digestion will go into overdrive and move so fast that you can’t absorb the nutrients from your food – think post espresso diarrhoea. Other times it gets painfully sluggish and slow – think bloating and constipation – either way, it’s no fun.\nTriggers can be certain food and drinks, irregular eating, stress and, funnily enough, hormones.\nIBD: Crohns and Ulcerative colitis \nIBD, or Inflammatory Bowel Disease, sounds similar but is quite different – as the name suggests IBD involves inflammation of the bowel. There are two types of IBD; Crohns – which can affect any part of the digestive tract, and Ulcerative Colitis – which only affects the large intestine. These two conditions have slightly different symptoms but both involve: \n\npain, cramps or swelling in the tummy\nrecurring or bloody diarrhoea\nweight loss and extreme tiredness may occur, as the inflamed parts of your GI tract are not able to absorb enough nutrients from your food. \n\nIBS and IBD can both be eased or worsened by certain triggers, but IBD can have a genetic factor as well, so your doctor may ask about your family history to help guide a diagnosis. \nIf you are concerned you might have IBD, speak to your doctor and check the NHS website for more detailed signs and symptoms.\n\nSo what does the pill have to do with this?\nContraceptive pills contain oestrogen and progestogen to prevent ovulation, or progestogen alone – and these hormones also have an impact on our digestive system.\nOestrogen \nFound in the combined contraceptive pill, oestrogen can cause nausea, or make it worse if you already experience it. This is especially true when you first start taking the pill, and for some people the nausea can pass after a few months of taking the pill – or be minimised by taking it at night or with food. However remember a common cause of nausea is pregnancy, so if this is a new symptom consider doing a pregnancy test.\nOestrogen also slows down the movement of your gut, so it takes much longer for things to move along and out. This means bloating, constipation and discomfort can be more likely.   \nThere is also a relationship between the oestrogen we produce and the good bacteria that live in our gut (microbiome) – it’s plausible that the microbiome could also be affected by oestrogen taken in the pill, but we don’t know for sure at this stage.\nProgestogen\nA synthetic version of the naturally occurring hormone progesterone; progestogen is found in the combined pill, and the mini/POP Pill. It can slow down digestion as it relaxes the smooth muscle of the gut, sometimes a little too much, which can cause constipation and bloating.\n\nCan the pill cause digestive problems? \nWell we know that these hormones can be associated with issues for the gut, and it is reflected in our Lowdown reviews that digestive issues can crop up or be made worse by the pill. However, it seems to vary quite a lot depending on the brand and the person taking them. \nFor example, some people found that taking the pill before bed helped with the nausea side effect, but for some the nausea was so bad it would wake them up if they took their pill before bed. Check out our guidance for changing the time you take your pill if you think this may help your nausea.\nLottie Drynan, author of My Tummy Diary and all round IBS babe, says: “I’d say the first month or so of being on the pill, my bloating was INTENSE. And my bowel movements were all over the place – mainly constipation. After a couple of months, it really settled down and despite never being so stressed due to renovating my house, my IBS has never been better. My tummy feels more settled, I’m completely regular (which I’ve never been before) and I only really get bloated just before my period or if something actually triggers me rather than just that random unexplainable daily bloat!”\nWhile Lottie noticed an improvement to her digestion with the pill, we’ve collected some Lowdown reviews that do highlight digestive issues – as always, everyone is different and you may not experience any issues at all!\n\n\n“Within two to three days of taking it, I had major nausea”\n“I was fine for the first year or so of using the pill but then I began vomiting after taking it sometimes.”\n“When I first started taking it I felt nauseous but I switched to taking it at night and was fine after the first couple of months!”\n“Some side effects including nausea and dizziness if I take the pill in the morning \nI only used it for a short time as from the first week of taking this pill it caused me major bloating issues and I felt nausea every day!”\n“I also had headaches and constipation for the whole time I was taking this pill.”\n“At times it will make me very nauseous and will keep me awake all night feeling sick.”\n“I also have IBS, so anxiety gives me a decreased appetite, meaning that while on the pill I could hardly eat. I threw up the first time I took the pill, but that could be because I had it on an empty stomach. I continued to use, and felt nausea for about 3 weeks before it gradually subsided.”\n“I take the pill at around 8-10pm to avoid feeling sick during the day”\n“Nausea was also something I struggled with whilst on it and once woke in the middle of the night to vomit because of it (maybe too high oestrogen for me?).”\n\nAlways seek medical advice for digestive problems that are severe, ongoing or which worry you.\n\nCan birth control cause IBS?\nIn short, no. IBS is caused by a combination of factors, such as how sensitive you are to certain foods, caffeine and alcohol, how your body responds to stress, and yes hormones as well – but taking the pill alone cannot cause IBS. \nDoes the pill make IBS worse though? Well, it may do in some people, and may depend on the type of pill you take. Same goes for IBD – your symptoms could be affected, but the pill can’t cause you to develop IBD.\nCan IBS make the pill less effective?\nBecause the pill is swallowed and absorbed through the digestive system, if you’re having digestive issues because of IBS or IBD, the pill may not be absorbed properly, and so may not be as effective as it could be. For example – nausea and vomiting from food poisoning could have you throwing up your pill without realising – and then you’re not protected from pregnancy.\nWhat to do if you have vomiting and diarrhoea while on the pill:\nLoose stools or vomiting can affect the effectiveness of birth control pills – you may need to bring in another measure to prevent pregnancy. \nThe NHS guidelines for when your pill is likely to be effected, and what to do include:\n\nIf you vomit within 2 hours of taking your contraceptive pill – the effectiveness has been compromised, as it probably didn’t have time to be absorbed properly\nIf you take another pill straight away, as long as you’re not sick again – you’ll still be protected against pregnancy\nTake your next pill at the usual time \nIf vomiting or diarrhoea continue for more than 24 hours – your pill’s effectiveness is likely to be affected – and so extra contraception, e.g. condoms, will be needed \nTry to carry on taking your pill – but if the vomiting and diarrhoea continue beyond 24 hours – count each day as a missed pill and use extra contraception\n\nAlthough, to be honest, you probably won’t be in the mood in between all of that vomiting and diarrhoea…\nIf you think you could have had sex while your pill wasn’t effective, emergency contraception may be necessary, either in the form of a morning after pill, or if you’re still experiencing vomiting or diarrhoea the copper coil can be fitted to prevent pregnancy.\n\nBest birth control methods for IBS and IBD\nIf you have IBS or IBD you’ll know that keeping your diet, exercise and stress levels in the right balance to keep your tummy happy can feel like a big task. You may have plenty of doctors appointments and medications to take already and the idea of figuring out your contraception on top of that is just another thing to juggle. \nDon’t worry, we’ve got you – here are some alternatives to the pill that may suit you better.\nLow oestrogen pills or the mini pill \nIf you want to keep taking a pill, you may want to opt for a brand with a lower dose of oestrogen, try taking it with food or just before bed to minimise any nausea side effects. A progestogen-only pill is another option to avoid nausea – and remember, for any new pill you try, give yourself 3 months to get used to it to get a good idea of whether it suits you.\n\nBarrier Methods\nWhether this is condoms, female condoms or a cap/diaphragm, the barrier method is a contraceptive that doesn’t involve hormones at all, so won’t affect/be affected by any digestive issues. Condoms also have the benefit of protecting against STIs. \nNon-digested contraception\nIf you often experience digestive issues due to IBD, IBS or anything else – opting a method of contraception that doesn’t go through your digestive system can reduce any impact the hormones may have on you digestion, and it can be comforting to know the effectiveness of the contraception won’t be affected by vomiting or diarrhoea.\nVaginal ring\nThe vaginal ring, or NuvaRing, is a flexible plastic ring that you put in the vagina, where it releases oestrogen and progestogen to prevent pregnancy. The effectiveness (99%) of the ring is not affected by digestive issues such as vomiting or diarrhea. Each ring lasts three weeks and once it’s in, you don’t have to think about it. With a 3 star Lowdown rating, check out our vaginal ring reviews. \nThe Patch \nThe contraceptive patch goes on the skin and releases oestrogen and progestogen – you put a new one on every week and they stay on through showers, baths, swimming etc. \n\nThe Copper Coil\nThe copper coil, AKA the intrauterine device (IUD), is a hormone free option that is inserted into the womb/uterus and lasts 5 to 10 years. It works by releasing tiny amounts of copper, which prompts your uterus to produce chemicals that affect sperm motility and cervical mucus, and prevents egg fertilisation and, possibly, implantation.\nThe Hormonal Coil\nThe hormonal coil, AKA the intrauterine system (IUS), is a little T-shaped device that sits in the womb and releases progestogen to prevent pregnancy. Depending on the brand it can last from 3 to 6 years and can be fitted by a doctor or nurse.\nThe Implant\nThe implant is a small flexible plastic rod that is put under the skin in your upper arm. It releases the hormone progestogen gradually into your bloodstream. It is effective for 3 years and can be fitted by a doctor or nurse.\nThe Injection\nThe contraceptive injection involves an injection (just like a normal jab) of progestogen, every 8-13 weeks depending on the brand. This will need to be administered by a nurse unless you choose the Sayana Press injection, which can be administered yourself at home. You can now order the Sayana Press injection from The Lowdown too for extra ease!\n\nCan I use emergency contraception if I have IBS?\nIf you are in need of emergency contraception, a copper IUD can be fitted instead of taking the morning after pill – so you don’t need to worry about whether the morning after pill will exacerbate IBS or IBD symptoms, or whether you’ll be able to absorb it properly through your GI tract.\nIBS, IBD and contraception vary so much based on the person, so it’s worth looking through our reviews for each method, and filter by side effects. Don’t be afraid to ask your GP about switching to a different method that might suit you better. Or, you could book an appointment with one of The Lowdown’s friendly team of women’s health GPs for advice on switching contraception – they specialise in contraception and really know their stuff.\nFor more help choosing a contraceptive method that might work best for you, The Lowdown’s contraception recommender is also a massive time saver.\nTake a look at Alysia’s story: an IBD sufferer and big fan of the coil, she tells The Lowdown about her journey to the best contraception for her.\n\nKimberley has medical bachelor from the University of Groningen, Netherlands, and completed their final year thesis on Sex Education. They are now a matchmaker for LGBTQ+ people in London, and especially love writing about queer health. Inclusive language and queer-specific topics are very important to them, making sure The Lowdown can serve all women and people with vaginas/uteruses/ovaries.\n",

        "Content": "\n\nhttps://youtu.be/l_YLUk5BUrM\n\n\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV) is a common virus that is passed on through skin-to-skin contact around the genital area, through vaginal, anal or oral sex, and sharing sex toys. Despite it being super common, most people don’t even know they have it as it can cause no symptoms, and often clears up on its own.\nHowever, HPV can cause abnormal cells to form in the cervix, which can lead to cervical cancer – this is why we have those handy cervical screening tests every 3-5 years, and have a HPV vaccine scheme in secondary schools.\nFor Cervical Cancer Prevention Week (17th-23rd January 2022), we’ve teamed up with the brilliant Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust to chat all things HPV – from busting myths and misconceptions, to signs, prevention and navigating what a positive screening result actually means.\n\nJo’s Cervical Cancer Trust are the UK’s leading cervical cancer charity. They provide information and support to those with cervical cancer and their loved ones, as well as running awareness campaigns and heading up new research and policy work on cervical cancer.\nRegister below to join The Lowdown’s Founder Alice, Medical Director Dr Melanie Davis-Hall and Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust for an evening of insightful chat.\nIn this free webinar, you’ll learn:\n\nWhat is HPV – and what it isn’t – causes and symptoms.\nHPV results – what does a positive result mean? Navigating the process of receiving a positive result, and the potential further screening processes.\nMyth busting common misconceptions around HPV – tackling the stigma.\nWe’ve also invited a Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust media volunteer to share their experience of getting a positive HPV result.\nThe latest research and findings from a survey by Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust on personal experiences of those living with HPV.\n\n–\nThis event took place on Wednesday 19th January, 2022.\n",

        "Title": "Acne returning when coming off the pill",
        "Content": "\n✅ If you think this blog will interest you, check out our newsletter for more: \n\nHormonal contraception can come with a multitude of benefits: pregnancy prevention, lighter periods, reduced PMS and – the holy grail – clearer skin. For many acne sufferers, the combined pill is actually prescribed as a first treatment option, with many praising the transformative effects it has on their skin. \nAt some point, though, some of us will want to stop taking the pill. Where acne is concerned, this presents a problem: what happens when you stop taking the pill?\nWe asked our users, and 40% of them told us that they experienced spots or acne when stopping contraception, and in hormonal methods, this figure was even higher. 47% of combined contraception users, 48% of injection users and 44% of mini pill users reported that they noticed their spots or acne worsening when they stopped taking their contraception.\nWhy is this? Does coming off the pill cause acne? Is this temporary? And how do we manage it? Here’s the lowdown…\nWhat happens when you stop taking the pill?\nTo answer this question, it’s probably easier to flip it on its head and look at what happens to our bodies and our hormones when we take the pill. Being on hormonal contraception alters the way our bodies’ reproductive systems naturally work, so when you stop taking the pill, you’re essentially going ‘back to normal’. \nThe combined pill suppresses our bodies’ natural hormones in favour of synthetic oestrogen and progestogen. The oestrogen in the combined pill reduces sebum (oil) production which contributes to acne. So if you had acne before taking the pill, and it cleared up while you were on it, its return when you stop your contraception may not be  a huge surprise. \nThat being said, our skin and hormones change as we age, and some women may find that their acne doesn’t return once they stop taking the pill. For other women, acne may seem to begin once they come off hormonal contraception, even though they have never had it before. This is because some acne occurs during puberty, and clears up into adulthood, while some acne, known as adult acne, occurs later in life. When you’re on the pill, these natural hormonal changes can be masked, so you might not know whether acne has cleared up, stuck around or begun until you stop taking it.\n\nCan the pill cause acne?\nYou might have been offered the pill to clear up your acne, or you may have found that the pill itself caused you to break out. We’ve got a full guide on the best contraceptive for acne, but here’s a brief breakdown:\nAcne is caused by excess sebum (oil) being produced in our skin’s glands. Androgens, which are produced in our ovaries, can ramp up the production of sebum and lead to blocked pores and spots. It is thought that oestrogen can dampen down the production of androgens, which is why most women are offered a combined contraception method as a first treatment option for acne. This also explains why some of us break out just before our periods, when our oestrogen levels drop.\nFor now, it isn’t really clear what effect progestogen, the hormone in the progestogen-only pill (aka the mini pill), has on acne. It is thought that it can make sebum production worse, though, which is why some women might experience more spots than normal while taking the progestogen-only pill. There are several types of progestogens, and some are classed as ‘antiandrogenic’, meaning they block androgen activity. There is evidence that hormonal contraception containing antiandrogenic progestogens could be more beneficial for acne when compared to progestogens that are not antiandrogenic. The differences between pills, as well as our own individual biology, explains why so many women find that their contraception affects their skin differently to their friends, for example.\nIt’s a minefield, we know, but it does go some way towards explaining why acne may return – or begin – when we stop taking hormonal contraception. Whatever effect your particular pill was having on your sebum production is removed, and our skin goes back to ‘normal’ – whatever that may be. This is the case not only if you stop contraception altogether, but also if you switch to a non-hormonal method, like the copper IUD, for example. \n\nWill coming off the pill cause acne?\nNo, coming off the pill won’t cause acne. But coming off the pill will unmask any acne problems that the pill itself was suppressing. If you saw your skin worsen on progestogen-only contraception, coming off it or switching to a combined method or non-hormonal method may improve it.\n\nManaging post-pill acne\nAs post-pill acne isn’t actually caused by the pill at all, it’s unlikely to go away on its own. Like we said earlier, what you’re experiencing is unrelated to your contraception, and is a result of your own natural hormones. The good news, though, is that there are increasingly more treatment options for acne, regardless of its severity.\n\nMild acne\nIf you have mild acne (whiteheads or blackheads, and the occasional spot) you should be able to treat the problem with a good skincare routine and/or some over-the-counter topical treatments.\nCertain acids, such as glycolic acid, salicylic acid and mandelic acid, are found in many skincare formulations, and have been clinically proven to improve both active acne and scarring. The quantities of each acid in different skincare products differ, though, so be sure to do your research and check out reviews before you invest.\nYour pharmacist may also offer you a gel or cleanser containing benzoyl peroxide. Benzoyl peroxide is an antiseptic, and it kills the germs on your skin that cause acne. Some formulations of benzoyl peroxide are only available on prescription, but you can buy Acnecide, a brand of benzoyl peroxide, over the counter. You can also find benzoyl peroxide in some skincare products, but the strength of the active ingredient can be low, so speak to your pharmacist if you’re unsure.\nModerate or severe acne\nModerate acne is characterised by a larger quantity of whiteheads and blackheads, as well as many spots. Severe acne is diagnosed if you have lots of large, painful cysts and spots, with or without scarring. \nThe NHS recommends that people with moderate or severe acne speak to their GP about treatment. Your doctor might prescribe you something topical (applied directly to the skin), like a retinoid or antibiotic, or may suggest you try an oral medication, such as an antibiotic pill or – you guessed it – hormonal contraception. Tell your doctor if you have stopped hormonal contraception for a specific reason or side effect; it may be that they are able to prescribe a method more suited to you that might help with your acne.\nYou may be referred on to a dermatologist if your acne is particularly severe. This usually happens when your acne is also present on your chest or back, if your acne is significantly painful or distressing, or if you have or are at risk of scarring. \nYou can also use the treatments advised for mild acne above, but speak to your doctor before mixing these with anything that has been prescribed to you. Do remember that it can take months to start seeing a difference in your skin after beginning an acne treatment.\n\nWhere can I get support for acne?\nAlways remember that you are so much more than your skin. Everybody is different, and the path you choose to take has to be right for you, whether that’s hormonal contraception or a non-hormonal treatment. Check out our blog on the best contraceptive pill for acne if you are looking to continue with hormonal contraception to manage your skin.\nIf you are finding yourself struggling with your confidence or mood because of your acne, please reach out to your GP or visit Acne Support, who have information about emotional support resources available to you.\nThe Lowdown are an online contraception provider. You can buy Microgynon, the Yasmin contraceptive pill and many more from us directly.\n\n\nAcnestar.com. 2021. Know the Relation between Estrogen Levels and Acne.

        "Content": "\nWhen it comes to switching your contraceptive, or even starting for the first time, there are hundreds of questions that come along with it. Like, how long does it take for a contraceptive to work? What are the side effects? Will it give help my heavy periods?\nBefore starting your new contraceptive, it’s important to know how long before it actually becomes effective – just because it’s in you, doesn’t mean it’s working! For this it’s important to know that day 1 of your menstrual cycle counts as the first day of your period starting.\nHow long does it take for a contraceptive to work?\nIf you want to know how long to wait before you can wave goodbye to those condoms (even though they’re always good to keep on hand for an emergency – remember they protect against STIs!) then we’ve got you covered.\nCombined pill\nIf you’re starting on the combined pill in the first 5 days of your natural period you are covered straight away.\nYou can also start it at any other time in your cycle but then you will need to use condoms or avoid sex for 7 days until your birth control pill starts working.\nProgestogen-only pill (POP)\nPOPs containing desogestrel, levonorgestrel or norethisterone\nIf you’re starting on one of these progestogen-only pills in the first 5 days of your natural period you are covered straight away.\nYou can also start it at any other time in your cycle but then you will need to use condoms or avoid sex for 2 days until it starts working.\nPOPs containing drospirenone\nIf you’re starting on one of these progestogen-only pills on the first day of your natural period you are covered straight away.\nAt any other time in your cycle you will need to use condoms or avoid sex for 7 days until it starts working. \nCopper IUD\nOnce the copper IUD is inserted, it is effective instantly. You shouldn’t have to worry about using another form of contraception, unless you’re using condoms for protection from STIs.\nThe great thing about the copper coil is that it can also work as emergency contraception. It can cover all unprotected sex in the previous 5 days or can be fitted within 5 days of the earliest likely date you ovulated (which a doctor or nurse can work out with you).\nHormonal IUS\nIf the hormonal coil is fitted in the first 5 days of your natural period you are covered straight away.\nThe hormonal coil can be inserted at any point in your cycle as long as there is no risk of pregnancy. You will need to use alternative contraception or avoid sex for 7 days after it is fitted until it starts working.\n\nImplant\nIf the implant is fitted in the first 5 days of your natural period you are covered straight away.\nThe implant can be inserted at any point in your cycle as long as there is no risk of pregnancy. You will need to use alternative contraception or avoid sex for 7 days after the implant is inserted until it starts working.\nContraceptive injection\nIf you have the injection in the first 5 days of your natural period you are covered straight away.\nThe injection can be given at any point in your cycle as long as there is no risk of pregnancy. You will need to use alternative contraception or avoid sex for 7 days after the injection until it starts working.\nIt’s important to get the contraceptive injection every 13 weeks. If you are late for getting a follow-up injection (it has been over 14 weeks since your last injection), you should use condoms or an alternative method until you get the injection and continue to use a backup method for 7 days after.\nContraceptive patch\nIf you first apply the contraceptive patch in the first 5 days of your natural period you are covered straight away. Remember day 1 counts as the first day of your period starting.\nYou can start it at any other time in your cycle but then you will need to use condoms or avoid sex for 7 days until it starts working.\nVaginal ring\nIf you insert the vaginal ring in the first 5 days of your natural period you are covered straight away.\nYou can also start it at any other time in your cycle but you will need to use condoms or avoid sex for 7 days until it starts working.\nMale and female condoms\nBoth the male condom and the female condom are effective straight away. However to ensure they are actually effective at preventing pregnancy, they must be used correctly. This means putting the condom on before any skin-to-skin contact or penetration.\nAs soon as you’re finished using a male condom, hold the condom at the base of the penis whilst you remove it to ensure no sperm leaks out, and then dispose of it straight away.\nYou must use a new condom every time you have sex for them to be effective.\nDiaphragm and cap \nThe diaphragm and cap are effective straight after insertion. Much like condoms, these methods need to be inserted properly for them to be fully effective. Check out the FAQs on our contraception page for more details on how to use them.\nSterilisation\nFemale sterilisation is a procedure that blocks the fallopian tubes to prevent an egg from reaching the uterus so it cannot be fertilised. This can be done at the time of caesarean section or otherwise via keyhole surgery under general anaesthetic (when you’re put to sleep).\nThis surgery is effective straight away, but you should wait 1-2 weeks after the operation to have sex (for comfort more than anything).\nVasectomy\nThe male vasectomy is a procedure that blocks the tube which carries sperm and involves a small operation which is done under local anaesthetic (a small injection) often in GP surgeries or private clinics.\nAbout 12 weeks after the operation, men should have a semen test to check that sperm are no longer present. During this time additional contraception should be used.\nSo, how long does it take for birth control to work exactly?\nIf you’re starting a new form of birth control, or switching between methods check out our starting and switching guide and check your options by talking to your doctor or healthcare provider. You can speak to one of our doctors, as well as check out The Lowdown’s contraception recommender and reviews to help you make the right decision.\n\nMaddie is an English Language and Linguistics graduate who is passionate about writing.

        "Title": "A GPs foray into FemTech: How I became Medical Director at The Lowdown",
        "Content": "\nI’ve been very flattered to be asked by the RCGP to write about my experience as a recently qualified (First 5) GP doing something different. I’m still suffering from imposter syndrome but I’m happy to share my story of how I fell into becoming Medical Director at a FemTech healthcare start up company.\nAt the end of my final year of GP training (ST3), as I was completing my portfolio and Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Health Diploma (DFSRH), a friend of a friend introduced me to Alice. Alice isn’t a medic, she is a patient, who has suffered debilitating symptoms from endometriosis throughout her adolescent and adult life. The treatment offered was evidence based and correct – hormonal contraception, however, Alice never managed to settle on a pill due to awful side effects. As a young woman, she didn’t want to read more medication leaflets, she wanted to hear from women’s real life experiences on different contraceptives. Alice quickly realised there was nowhere to access this information, and therefore The Lowdown was born.\nThe Lowdown is a website and contraception review platform which has collated thousands of real life reviews from women using different forms of birth control. The medically reviewed blogs answer questions that patients really want to know and perhaps we don’t cover in GP training; such as “will my partner feel my coil during sex?” and “can the pill cause hair loss?”\nSo where did I come in? Alice was looking for a medic to join her on the mission to change the face of contraception. We had a chat over the phone, and Alice asked me if I would be interested in joining her small team to offer telemedicine appointments to users, medically review blogs and give a medic’s opinion on The Lowdown’s ideas and direction.\n\nDr Fran and Alice discussing how to set up The Lowdown’s first ever consultation request (yes we sent our users a PayPal link)\nI was absolutely thrilled to be offered this opportunity and dove in head first. Since joining, I have offered over 100 women advice on their contraception choice, side effects and allied women’s health problems via telephone or video call, written and reviewed blogs and even helped to develop computer algorithms and tools including a “missed pill calculator”.\nThe work is completely different to my salaried role. I have learned about business, technology and legal aspects of Medicine that were never covered in GP training. I can offer a service to women that isn’t limited by NHS time constraints, really understanding and responding to their needs, which means I receive some amazing feedback. The enjoyment I get from this allows me to continue working hard under pressure at my NHS practice.\n\nGoing global, one month in\nI have been able to appreciate even more the discourse between doctors and patients. The Lowdown’s data is subjective and qualitative, and medics often worry negative reviews would deter women from using certain contraceptives. In fact, I have come to realise that we still hold paternalistic views as medics. Women are able to read both positive and negative reviews, forming their own judgement and value the negative to prepare them for potential problems.\nWhy is this relevant to First 5 GPs? I think the reason I was able to join The Lowdown team was BECAUSE I am a First 5 GP. Alice had spoken to multiple medics before she met me. They were older and more established in their career and often more hesitant about The Lowdown’s plans. However, I was young, keen, excited and ready to be part of something innovative. This is our advantage as First5 GPs.\nSo, if an opportunity comes along to get involved with something less traditional than the “standard NHS GP”, don’t sell yourself short. A young, keen and innovative GP has it’s advantages and we can be a great asset.\n\nbr>\nOne of The Lowdown’s fab Clinical Directors, Dr Frances Yarlett MBBCh (Hons) BSc (Hons) MRCP (2016) MRCGP DFSRH completed her medical training from Cardiff University in 2013. She is currently working as a salaried GP partner in Sheffield with an interest in complex medical patients and women’s health. Fran is really passionate about patient choice and wants to empower women to take control of their bodies and contraception needs.",

The patch contains the same hormones but is a thin beige plastic plaster, which is stuck to the skin and changed weekly. It’s a great option if you want the benefits of the combined pill, but don’t want to take a pill every day. Similarly the vaginal ring contains the same hormones which are released form a soft plastic ring that sits in the vagina. \nGuidance in the UK tells us for these methods you should have a medical review at least once a year. If ordering your pill, patch or ring through The Lowdown you’ll be asked to complete a form containing a series of questions, including about your blood pressure, height and weight, and medical and family history when you first order. When you reorder, or after 12 months of subscriptions, you will be asked to confirm these answers or tell us whether something has changed. \nHowever there are some circumstances where you should seek a medical review before then, including the following…\n\nWhen you should seek medical advice before 12 months\nIf you develop:\n\nCalf pain, swelling or redness\nChest pain, breathlessness or coughing up blood\nWeakness or loss of sensation in the arms, legs or face, or changes to speech \n\nThese could be symptoms of a blood clot in the legs or the lungs, also known as a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), or a stroke. These are small but recognised risks of combined contraception and require urgent medical attention. \nIf you develop:\n\nA breast lump, breast skin changes, nipple discharge or new nipple inversion\nNew migraine\nNew symptoms in the hour before a migraine starts which may be a sign of a migraine aura \nPersistent unscheduled vaginal bleeding\n\nThese symptoms should prompt you to speak to your doctor. Your doctor will review and potentially investigate these symptoms depending on the situation. It may be that some of these symptoms mean you should stop or switch your contraception. \nWhen else should I seek medical advice?\nIf you develop any of the conditions listed below you should seek advice from your doctor or contraception provider. In most cases having one of these conditions will mean it is not safe for you to start or continue on combined contraception.\n\nHigh blood pressure\nHigh body mass index (>35 kg/m2)\nMigraine or migraine with aura\nDeep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism\nBlood clotting abnormality\nAntiphospholipid antibodies\nAngina, heart attack, stroke or vascular disease\nAtrial fibrillation\nCardiomyopathy\nBreast cancer or breast cancer gene mutation\nLiver tumour\nSymptomatic gallstones\nCurrent smoker (any number of cigarettes) or quit within the last year AND you are over the age of 35\n\nOther important things to make sure you have covered when reviewing your contraception\n\nWhen and how to start using the combined pill, patch or ring and whether additional contraception such as condoms is required before you are protected against pregnancy\nWhat to do when the combined pill, patch or ring is used incorrectly or inconsistently and when you might need emergency contraception (check out our missed pill calculator)\nHealth risks associated with use of the combined pill, patch or ring including the small risks of blood clots, increased blood pressure and some cancers. (See below for advice on travel, high altitude and surgery) \nHow and when to get your next prescription. Remember you may need to reorder your pill, patch or ring earlier if you use your contraception continuously without breaks \nWhat to do if you wish to stop or switch your method of contraception. Scroll down to the ‘How to use’ section of our ‘About’ pages for the combined pill or patch or vaginal ring. \n\n\nA note about the patch…\nIf you are using the combined patch it is important to be aware that the patch may be less effective at protecting you against pregnancy if you weigh more than 90kg. This is regardless of your height or BMI. This does not mean you cannot use it, for example if it helps with heavy or painful periods, but extra precautions such as condoms or switching to an alternative is recommended to protect against pregnancy.\nA note about the vaginal ring…\nThe SyreniRing and NuvaRing are practically identical; they both contain the same types and amounts of oestrogen and progestogen. The key difference between these vaginal rings is that the SyreniRing has a shelf life of two years, and doesn’t need to be refrigerated, which means you can be prescribed up to a year’s supply at once. The NuvaRing however, must be refrigerated before being dispensed (sent out to you), and then used within 4 months. You should store your Nuvaring at room temperature, in a safe place away from sunlight.\nHow long can you use the pill, patch or vaginal ring for?\nLots of us have heard myths like you can’t use the pill for longer than 10 years or you should have a break every few years. The Lowdown? You may use the combined pill, patch or vaginal ring for contraception until the age of 50 provided there are no contraindications. After the age of 50, the risks of use generally outweigh the contraceptive benefits and you should be advised to switch to an alternative method.\nFor those who can safely use combined contraception there is no arbitrary maximum length of time for which the pill, patch or ring can be used. In fact, repeated starting and stopping is discouraged because the risk of a blood clot in the legs or lungs is highest in the months after you start, or when restarting after a break of more than a month. \nAdvice on travel, high altitude and having surgery….\nDue to the small increased risk of blood clots in the legs or lungs whilst using combined contraception you should look out for and reduce other risk factors for blood clots such as periods of immobility. You should reduce periods of time where you have reduced mobility, such as on long haul flights, by regularly moving around. \nIf you are considering trekking to high altitudes (above 4500 m or 14500 feet) for longer than one week consider switching to an alternative contraceptive method. This is because the risk of blood clots may be higher at altitude.\nThose who are immobile or have restricted mobility for an extended period of time (due to surgery or other reasons) are at increased risk for blood clots which may be further increased by use of combined contraception. You should therefore be advised to stop and switch to an alternative method of contraception at least 4 weeks prior to planned major surgery or a period of expected immobility. Talk to your doctor or surgeon if you are unsure. \nProgestogen-only pill\nGuidance around review of the progestogen-only pill (POP) is less strict due to fewer health risks associated with progestogen-only contraception and prescriptions can be issued for up to 12 months at a time. \nIf ordering your POP through The Lowdown you’ll be asked to complete a form containing a series of questions, including about your medical history when you first order. When you reorder or after 12 months of subscriptions you will be asked to confirm these answers or tell us whether something has changed. \nIn general reviews and follow-up should be tailored to the individual and you should be able to seek advice from your doctor, nurse or contraceptive provider at any time if problems arise, including if you are experiencing unwanted side effects.\nKey reasons to seek medical advice about stopping the progestogen only pill and switching to another contraceptive include the following diagnoses:  \n\nAngina or heart attack, or heart disease\nStroke\nBreast cancer\nLiver cirrhosis\nLiver tumour\n\nSome other points to make sure you’ve covered when reviewing your progestogen only pill are included in this handy checklist. If you don’t know – click on the links!\n\nWhen and how to start using the POP and whether additional contraception such as condoms is required before you are protected against pregnancy\nWhat to do when the POP is used incorrectly or inconsistently and when you might need emergency contraception (check out our missed pill calculator too)\nHow and when to get your next prescription \nWhat to do if you wish to stop or switch your method of contraception. Scroll down to the ‘How to use’ section of our ‘About’ pages for the POP. \n\nSayana Press injection\nThe Sayana Press is a contraceptive injection containing a type of progestogen which you administer yourself at home every 3 months. You can have a supply of 3 months, 6 months or 12 months. To order the injection through us at The Lowdown you must have previously been taught how to use the injection by a health care professional. You should seek a review of your contraception if you are experiencing unwanted side effects. You should also speak to your doctor, nurse or contraception provider about stopping the injection and switching to an alternative contraceptive if you develop:\n\nVascular disease\nAngina, heart attack or heart disease\nStroke\nUnexplained vaginal bleeding\nBreast cancer \nLiver cirrhosis\nLiver tumour\n\n You should also seek a review of the suitability of the injection if you develop:\n\nHigh blood pressure\nWeight gain (or BMI over 30)\nHigh cholesterol\nDiabetes\nOr you take up smoking \n\n These are all risk factors for heart disease and whilst one condition may not mean you should not use the injection, multiple risk factors may mean the injection is unlikely to be a suitable method.  \nOther points to make sure you’ve covered when reviewing your progestogen only pill are included in this handy checklist. If you don’t know – click on the links!\n\nWhen and how to start using the injection and whether additional contraception such as condoms is required before you are protected against pregnancy\nWhat to do when the injection is used incorrectly or inconsistently and when you might need emergency contraception \nHow and when to get your next prescription \nWhat to do if you wish to stop or switch your method of contraception. Scroll down to the ‘How to use’ section of our ‘About’ pages for the injection. \n\nBleeding on the POP or injection\nBleeding patterns are very unpredictable in the first few months of using progestogen-only contraception and breakthrough bleeding is common. Some lucky women may have no periods or infrequent periods, whereas others may bleed more frequently or have prolonged bleeding. This can settle the longer you use the mini pill or injection. Although these symptoms may be annoying, they can be normal. If your bleeding pattern suddenly changes, or you get bleeding associated with other symptoms, consider doing a pregnancy test and STI test. Get a Clearblue pregnancy test from Amazon (affiliate link).\nIf irregular bleeding continues or is problematic speak to your GP.\nChecking if any medications or medicines can affect your contraception\nWhen you are prescribed a new medication or buy over the counter medicines, you should check whether the medicine could affect your contraception and its effectiveness. Check this with the prescriber of any new medication, with your contraceptive provider or your pharmacist. Read our blog about antibiotics and how some may interact with your contraception.\nIn summary…\nAs always, if you are unhappy with your method of contraception, think you are experiencing unwanted side effects or have questions about your contraception you can seek advice at any time from your contraception provider, doctor or nurse or from our medical team here at The Lowdown. \nDr Melanie Davis-Hall BMBS (Hons) BMedSci (Hons) DSFRH MRCGP is a GP from London experienced in women’s health.

        "Title": "Feeling sore after sex? Why your vagina hurts and what to do about it",
        "Content": "\n✅ If you think you’ll find this blog interesting, check out our newsletter for more:\n\nVaginal pain during or after sex is way more common than you might think, affecting up to 7.5% of women and people with vaginas at some point in their lives.\nUnsurprisingly, studies show that experiencing painful sex (dyspareunia) can be associated with poor sexual, relational, physical and mental health. So it’s super important to get help so you can go back to enjoying the pleasure of sex.\nHere we’re going to take a closer look at what some of the causes of a sore vagina after sex are, when to seek medical advice and what treatments are available.\n\nIs it normal to be sore after sex? \nNope, it’s not. Sex should not be uncomfortable. \nAnd, because a sore vagina could have such a broad range of underlying causes, it’s important that you pay attention to any symptoms of pain or discomfort. \nMedically speaking, the official definition of painful sex (dyspareunia) is when there’s recurrent or persistent pain before or after intercourse. But, the bottom line is, any sensation of pain in your vagina, vulva, pelvis or anywhere else is a sign that your body is telling you something is wrong and should not be ignored. This might include general soreness, stinging, sharp pain, pressure or any discomfort.\nPlease don’t worry about checking in with your GP if sore sex is a new symptom for you. \nWhat counts as vaginal pain?\nAnatomy 101: so the vulva refers to the entirety of the external genitals including the inner and outer labia, clitoris, vestibule of the vagina (vaginal opening) and urethra (where pee comes out).\nPainful sex can be associated with the vulva, vagina, pelvic area and lower back. Depending on where the pain is felt, this can provide a clue to the diagnostic approach as well as treatment options. \nTypes of painful sex\nThere’s a few classifications of painful sex that might be causing your vagina to hurt:\n\nSuperficial: Localised to vulva or vaginal entrance\nDeep: Inside the vagina or lower pelvis, often associated with deep penetration\nPrimary dyspareunia:  pain during sex since the start of sexual activity\nSecondary dyspareunia: pain occurs after some time of pain-free sex\n\nYou might also hear the term vulvodynia which can be associated with painful sex. However, the key difference is that this refers to vulval pain that can be triggered with or without sex (with no known cause).\n\nWhy does my vagina hurt after sex?\nThere are a few reasons why you might have a sore vagina after sex. Here are the more common causes: \nVigorous sex\nSometimes sore sex can simply be caused by a slightly more ‘passionate’ session. A lot of pressure, friction or prolonged sex can cause pain or discomfort in the vagina after penetration.\nThis can also be the case when using sex toys – they require just as much lube as the real deal to avoid causing inflammation and soreness. Talking of lube…\nA lack of lubrication\nIf you aren’t fully aroused when you attempt to have sex it can be painful. This is normal, and may be due to too little foreplay.\nUsing lube to reduce friction can make sex more fun and comfortable!\nGet Yes lube from Amazon.\nFind out more about why you should use lubricant.\nSkin conditions\nIrritant or allergic Contact Dermatitis\nThis can lead to itching and pain during sex, triggered by chemicals or allergens in products used for the skin. In some individuals’, chemicals cause an immune response leading to itching and redness.\nCommon products that can trigger this include baby wipes, lubricants and feminine hygiene products, topical medications and latex in condoms. \nLichen Sclerosis\nLichen Sclerosis is a condition which can cause itchy white patches on the vulva that can result in a burning sensation, tightness and scarring. This can make your vagina sore after or during sex.\nSperm allergy\nWhilst rare, an allergic reaction to sperm can cause redness and burning in the vaginal area, typically 10-30 minutes after sex. This can be triggered at any point, from any sexual partner.\n\nMedication\nYour contraception\nThe contraceptive pill can also be associated with vaginal dryness and therefore a sore vagina after sex.\nProgestogen-only pills (the mini pill) and other forms of progestogen only contraception are thought to cause vaginal dryness in some users because they do not contain oestrogen, the hormone responsible for blood flow to the vagina and pelvic area, particularly during arousal. This in turn affects vaginal lubrication and can cause painful sex.\nHowever vaginal dryness has also been reported by users of combined contraception including the pill, hormonal coil (IUS) and vaginal ring.\n\nAntidepressants\nSome studies suggest antidepressants can lead to persistent vulva pain and lubrication problems.\nPsychosexual causes\nVaginismus\nVaginismus is an involuntary tightening of the vaginal muscles which can cause difficulty and pain with penetration. This can be caused by stress around sexual contact, sometimes due to past experiences or bad relationships.\n\nInfections\nThrush\nThe extremely common fungal infection thrush could cause a sore vagina, with other symptoms including the characteristic cottage cheese-like discharge and itching. Read more about the causes of thrush.\nSTIs\nA sore vagina after sex can be a number one sign of an STI (for example chlamydia, gonorrhoea and herpes). Each can cause discomfort, pain, stinging sensations – another reason to keep on top of regular testing.\nPelvic Inflammatory Disease\nPelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) is caused by infection and can lead to a deep pain due to inflammation of the pelvic organs. Untreated STIs are one of the most common causes of PID.\nMedical conditions\nIf you have deep pain or soreness within the pelvic or vagina during sex, it could suggest a couple of different conditions.\nOvarian cysts\nOvarian cysts are fluid filled sacs within the ovaries, which often cause no symptoms and are completely harmless. However, in some cases they can rupture, which can be extremely painful and requires immediate medical attention. Ovarian cysts may cause pain during sex on the side of the affected ovary.\nEndometriosis\nEndometriosis is a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the womb starts to grow in other parts of the body. It can cause mild to excruciating pain up to 48 hours after sex.\nThis is due to inflammation and endometrial tissue that has grown in the pelvis, causing the uterus and vagina to be stretched and pulled during sex.\n\nShould I go to see my GP? \nYes. 100%. Vaginal soreness during or after sex is not a symptom that should have to be endured.\nIf you’re experiencing superficial pain, it’s likely that you will have a physical examination. Depending on the cause, treatment could involve antibiotics for an infection or steroid creams for skin irritation. If the root is a psychological one, this could involve therapy or counselling. \nFor pelvic pain / internal deep pain, your GP will probably refer you to a gynaecologist and arrange an ultrasound scan which can detect possible causes such as ovarian cysts. \nWant to speak to someone about soreness during sex?

        "Title": "Intimate washes &#8211; are they safe and should we use them?",
        "Content": "\n✅ If you find this blog interesting, make sure to check out our newsletter:\n\nMost intimate washes, while marketed as natural, safe for sensitive skin, moisturising, bacteria-fighting, anti-inflammatory and pH-balancing, often cause more harm than good. Here we share why it’s not necessary to use intimate washes and the side effects of excessively washing your vagina.\nWhat is an intimate wash?\nIntimate washes, or vaginal washes, are cleaning solutions specifically formulated for and marketed towards cleansing the ‘intimate area’, AKA, the vulva. Not to be confused with the vagina, the vulva refers to the external genital area; including the clitoris, inner and outer labia (minora and majora), the urethral opening and vaginal opening.\n These ‘feminine hygiene’ (lol) products are usually found in the section of a store alongside other menstrual products. Chances are you’ve already heard a thing or two about these magical washes that reportedly make your vulva feel or smell fresh and clean; the feminine hygiene wash market is set to grow by 6%, up to $123 million, from 2020-2024. The ‘feminine hygiene’ product market as a whole is worth $40 billion in 2021 and projected to grow to almost $55 billion by 2028.\nIntimate washes are supposedly safer and healthier for your vulva than a typical body wash, and are directed for external use only. You might therefore be tempted to use an intimate wash to combat vaginal discharge, but let us stop you right there. Pretty much all of us have discharge, and for good reason. Discharge is perfectly natural, and necessary for keeping the vagina clean, lubricated, and protected against infection.\nWhat causes vaginal discharge? \nVaginal discharge is controlled by your natural sex hormones, oestrogen and progesterone, which fluctuate throughout your menstrual cycle – hence the change in colour, consistency and amount of discharge throughout the month. Vaginal discharge is actually really important for fertility and changes to allow sperm to more easily swim through it towards an egg around the time of ovulation. Hormonal contraception methods can cause discharge to vary a bit, with many users reporting more vaginal discharge, and conversely vaginal dryness, as possible side effects. You can filter our reviews by side effect to see for yourself!\nA healthy vagina contains beneficial bacteria called lactobacilli that help it to maintain the ideal acidic pH, which ranges from about 3.5-4.5. Keeping the vagina at this pH helps to prevent the buildup of infection-causing harmful bacteria. In general, discharge from a healthy vagina should be mildly scented, clear, or milky white in colour, and thick, sticky, or slippery and wet in texture.\n\nShould I wash my vagina?\nWhile the idea of having a vagina that smells like fresh flowers may be enticing, the truth is that vaginas naturally have their own scent as a result of a set of sex hormones called pheromones. Excessive cleaning is unnecessary and potentially harmful, as vaginas possess their own set of self-cleaning powers.\nSide effects of using feminine wash\nOne of the main causes of disrupting the sensitive environment of the vagina is by over washing it and stripping away the healthy bacteria it contains (lactobacilli) which help to fight against infections.\nWhen a woman washes inside their vagina, or douches, they run the risk of disrupting their natural pH, which can result in irritation, or conditions such as bacterial vaginosis or thrush.\nStudies show that using cleaning methods that strip the vagina of its natural microbiota actually increases the risk of these infections by anywhere from 8-20%.\nA 2018 study found that participants who reported using feminine washes/gels had almost 3.5 times higher odds of reporting BV and almost 2.5 times higher odds of reporting a UTI. In the most extreme conditions, douching in the presence of an STI could increase the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease.\n\nWhat about natural washes – are they safe?\nRecently, companies such as AH!YES and Love Wellness Co. have launched intimate washes that claim to be gentle enough for everyday use without causing infection. They are marketed as ‘matching vaginal pH’ and are composed of all natural, organic and hypoallergenic ingredients.\nHowever, most of these products still contain perfumes and alcohols meant to make the area feel more fresh and clean, but can dry out and irritate the sensitive vulva.\nThe internet also contains a plethora of recipes for DIY vaginal washes, which promote the use of ingredients such as witch hazel, coconut oil, essential oils, castile soap and rose oil.\nAgain, these ingredients can be just as stripping and irritating for the vulva as the artificial ingredients found in store-bought washes. Using an intimate wash that majorly affects the pH of your vagina may affect more than just its natural infection-fighting mechanisms, as a pH imbalance can damage sperm and prevent it from fertilising an egg.\nOur mantra is: if you use it to unblock a sink, don’t put it on your vulva – even if it’s a ‘natural’ cleaner.\nHow to clean your vulva\nThe best way to maintain the health and cleanliness of your vagina and vulva is by avoiding intimate washes, perfumed and non-perfumed soaps, deodorant and hygiene wipes.\nInstead, use plain old, clean water to wash externally, no more than one to two times per day. Yep, you heard that right; the best way to clean your vulva is with water. That’s it!\n\nErin is an Associate Account Executive at BGB Group in New York City.

        "Content": "\nWorking out the hormone levels of different contraceptives is quite complicated, so we’re starting to put together some research for you.\nThis graph shows the amount of hormone (oestrogen and progestogen) contained in a pill, or released in a 24 hour period, for every brand of contraception The Lowdown features. The amount of hormone is in micrograms (mcg), which is one millionth of a gram.\nAll contraceptives – approximate daily hormonal release rates (micrograms)\n\nAs you can see it varies quite a lot. But this doesn’t mean that some types or brands are ‘better’ or ‘worse’ than others, because different types of hormones have different levels of ‘potency’. Potency is how much of a drug is needed to give a certain affect. A highly potent drug evokes a given response at low concentrations, while a drug of lower potency evokes the same response only at higher concentrations. For example, the hormone drospirenone (which is in the Yasmin combined pill and Lucette) needs a lot more than other pills (almost 3000 mcg) to work with he oestrogen component of the pill as a contraceptive.\nCombined and progestogen only pills: micrograms of hormone in each tablet\n\nContraceptives also contain inactive ingredients – things like lactose, starch or saline solution that help to bind the pills together, or help inject or deliver the hormones into your blood supply or body. These can also impact the way you metabolise the hormones in the contraceptive – whether it acts quickly or slowly in your system.\nIf we break this up to just look at the combined and progesterone only pills, you can see that many different brands of pill contain exactly the same type and amount of hormones. (above)\nHormonal coil (IUS): approximate micrograms of hormone released every 24 hours (averaged over a 5 year period)\n\nThe hormonal coils (IUS) work differently. They sit within your womb and release tiny amounts of the hormone progestogen into your body over several years. Here is the amount of progestogen released every 24 hours for each brand of the hormonal coil.\nInjections: total dose injected (every 8-12 weeks)\n\nFor the contraceptive injection it is not possible to work out the amount of hormone that is ‘released’ into you every day, so we can only give you the total amount injected every 8-12 weeks.\nImplant, patch and vaginal ring: approximate micrograms of hormone released every 24 hours (over a 3 week and 3 year period\n\nFinally, here are the daily hormone release rates for the implant, ring and patch. The patch and ring amounts are averaged over 3 weeks (the length of time you use one before taking a break) and the implant is averaged over its three year lifespan.\n\n",

        "Content": "\nWhen discussing how effective contraception is, we use the terms perfect and typical use.\n‘Typical use’ is what we think of as real-world use and is what we care about most. This includes all the pregnancies which happened when people were using contraception regardless of how reliably they were taking them.\n‘Perfect use’ is what we see in clinical trials where researchers prompted participants to take the contraceptives exactly how and when they should. As real-life humans, it is unlikely we will use a method 100% perfectly all the time.\nTypical use probably overestimates risk for people who are reliable at using their contraceptive method. Perfect use can give false assurance of how effective a method is. In reality, the true effectiveness of contraception probably sits in between these statistics.\nThe more reliably you take a medication, the more likely it is to work. If you forget pills or miss the right windows for taking, it becomes less dependable.\nOur missed pill calculator can help work out what you need to minimise the risk of pregnancy if you have a slip-up. Remember, very few people will take a pill perfectly, but many will take it reliably.\nLong-acting contraception like implants, injections and coils have minimal ‘user- error’, which means that the typical and perfect use are very similar. A slight difference represents people forgetting to renew a method of contraception, and it then expires.\nThe table below shows the % of women experiencing an unintended pregnancy during the first year of typical and perfect use of that method of contraception. \nSo if you followed 100 individuals who used the combined pill typically for a year, 9 would get pregnant.\nThis table contains estimates based on available data.

        "Title": "Does birth control affect your sex drive?",
        "Content": "\n✅ If you think this blog will interest you, make sure to check out The Lowdown’s newsletter:\n\nAroused, libidinous, turned on or just plain horny: sex drive has a million weird and wonderful names, and it’s time we started talking about it.\nIf you’ve found your way here, you’ve probably got some questions about libido. Maybe you’ve noticed a change in your sex drive since you started a new contraceptive method, or are doing your research before you talk through your options with your GP. Whatever your queries about contraception and sexual drive, we’ve got you covered. But first, let’s have a look at what sexual drive actually is.\nWhat is libido?\nYour libido is your sexual appetite, so in reality how frequently you want sex, and how strong your interest in it is. Libido can be influenced by a number of factors, including hormones, lifestyle and overall physical health. \nWhen we talk about ‘losing our sex drive’ or ‘having a low libido’, though, we don’t always mean that it is only our desire for sex that has changed. There are actually a few different factors that can contribute to our enjoyment of sex, and it’s important that we understand what those are before we make decisions about our contraception.\n\nWhat causes low libido?\nSex drive is a mammoth subject, especially when it comes to women. Like most things to do with our health, it’s woefully under-researched and women can feel ashamed to speak about libido and the way it impacts their lives. It’s also really difficult to specify precisely what might be causing changes to libido, because there are so many societal, cultural, psychological and physiological factors that can play a role.\nOne study¹ has explored these factors. In 2017, researchers from Kentucky asked 31 women to answer questions about their experiences of sexual desire. They found that cultural gender expectations – what is ‘expected’ of women – can impact sex drive and libido. Particularly within the LGBTQ+ community, a lack of visible or safe spaces can have an influence, and religion, taboo and changing cultural times were also picked up as themes within the research, demonstrating how multifaceted and complex sexual drive really is. These factors don’t just influence how interested we are in sex, either. They can affect your arousal (the physical and emotional effects you feel when engaging in or thinking about sex, like lubrication), your satisfaction (whether or not you orgasm, or are satisfied with how the sex made you feel) and can even cause us to experience pain during intercourse.\nWhy is this important?\nEveryone is different, and so what they hope or wish to experience during sex is different, too. For one person, physical intimacy might be an indication of a satisfying sexual experience, while for another, orgasm might be really important. For some, simply removing the potential for an unexpected pregnancy greatly improves their enjoyment of sex.\nThis is completely subjective, so it’s important that you know what a positive sexual experience means to you. That way, when you’re making choices about your contraception, you can prioritise accordingly. \nNow, let’s get into the big question…\nDoes birth control affect your libido?\nA lot of what we hear about sex drive and contraception is anecdotal, such as stories from friends, and while this is still really important, it doesn’t give us any real scientific answers as to whether specific contraception can cause changes to libido.\nLike we said, there’s a lack of research when it comes to this question, and the evidence that is out there isn’t always consistent.\nThat being said, let’s go through what science can tell us.\n\nWhat does science tell us about contraceptives and libido?\nA review² looking at all of the evidence surrounding combined contraception and libido until 2012 found that a small number of women experienced an increase or decrease in libido, while the majority of participants across studies experienced no changes to their sexual desire at all.\nAnother review³ found there to be no consistent pattern among participants – as in the above study, some experienced reduced libido, others experienced heightened libido, and most experienced no change whatsoever. The researchers here suggest that any changes might be due to a complex interaction of psychological, social and biological effects, like we mentioned earlier, which are really difficult to tease apart.\nCombined hormonal contraception: does the pill reduce libido?\nCombined hormonal contraception is any form of contraception that contains both oestrogen and progestogen. This includes some pills, the patch and the vaginal ring.\nOestrogen may play a role in changes to sexual drive in some women. Interestingly, combined hormonal contraceptives containing lower levels of oestrogen seem to have a greater impact on sexual drive than those containing higher levels.⁴ ⁵ Again, though, this appears to affect only a small number of women.\nCombined hormonal contraception has also been found to lower the levels of testosterone in the body.⁶ There is some evidence that testosterone can influence libido in women.⁷ In one study,⁸ which looked at women aged 18-35, testosterone was found to be lowered following combined hormonal contraception, but this had no significant impact on sexual drive. It is thought that the effect of testosterone on libido could be affected by the sensitivity of an individual’s androgen receptors (the receptors in the brain that bind testosterone). Essentially, whether or not your libido is affected by changing levels of testosterone could just be down to your unique biology. Helpful, we know.\nCombined pill regimens\nResearch has found that certain pill regimens (the way you take your pill) may have an impact on sexual function. There is evidence⁶ that the more ‘hormonal days’ you have – the days on which you take a pill – the more sexual function may be improved. One research study⁹ found that those taking a new, low-dose combined contraceptive pill, with a reduced hormone-free interval (shorter pill free week, had generally improved sexuality over time. The same researchers¹⁰ also found that a continuous contraception regimen could worsen the quality of a woman’s sexual life before causing an improvement. More research is definitely needed here.\nProgestogen-only contraception\nProgestogen-only contraception is hormonal contraception that only contains the hormone progestogen (we really over-explained that one, didn’t we?). It does not contain oestrogen. The mini pill, the injection, the hormonal coil and the implant are all types of progestogen-only contraception.\nThe effects of progestogen-only contraception on libido aren’t well studied, but the current evidence suggests that it does not have a negative impact on sexual drive.¹¹ No research has found a significant link between progestogen-only contraception and libido changes.\nHormonal contraception in general\nWhile the jury seems to be out on whether hormonal contraception directly affects libido, there is the possibility that it could be indirectly causing a drop (or rise!) in your sex drive\n\nCan hormonal birth control indirectly affect libido?\nHormonal contraception does come with some side effects that have a bit more research evidence, and there’s a chance that these might be impacting your libido, arousal and sexual satisfaction.\nSome people find that the hormones in their contraception cause vaginal dryness, which might not affect your interest in sex, but may impact how much you enjoy it. All hormonal contraceptives also come with a warning that they may cause mood changes, too, so if you’re experiencing low mood, this could be an indirect cause of a reduction in your libido.\nAdditionally, one study has found that those who have negative mood side effects from their hormonal contraception are more likely to also experience sexual side effects,¹² so that’s something to bear in mind.\nOn the other hand, there are obviously some positive consequences of taking hormonal contraception – we do it for a reason, right? It reduces your risk of pregnancy, which can mean you feel less worried about protecting yourself during sex and can just go with the flow (although it doesn’t protect against STIs, which only condoms do). If taking the pill every day is something you struggle with, a more long-term form of contraception, such as the hormonal coil, implant or injection, may help to reduce any worry that might be impacting your interest in or enjoyment of sex.\nHormonal contraception can also reduce the length, pain or heaviness of your periods, which some people find improves their interest in sex. Of course, there are some people who find that their periods are longer or heavier on hormonal contraception, so this is something that could have the opposite effect, too.\nIf you’re finding that your sex drive has been affected since you began taking hormonal contraception, it might be worth thinking about other side effects you might be experiencing that could be having an impact and what else is going on in your life. That way, you can talk to your GP about changing over to something that might have less of a risk of a particular side effect.\nYou could also consider non-hormonal contraception such as the copper coil. These methods of contraception are unlikely to directly impact your sex drive.\n\nWhat are The Lowdown users saying?\nOur users tell a different story to the research. As of December 2022, this is what our current review data tells us\n\n51% of progestogen-only pill users said that they had experienced a reduction in libido. 9% reported an increase in sex drive, and 30% said they had experienced no change.\nCombined pill users were only slightly behind this figure, with 48% of them telling us that the pill had caused caused them to experience a loss in sex drive. While 7% saw an increase, and 30% saw no change.\n50% of implant users also reported a reduction in their sex drive, with 6% seeing an increase and 28% experiencing no change. The highest percentages of people who saw a reduction in their libido were vaginal ring users, at 54%, and injection users at 56%.\nThere are other hormonal contraceptives that our users felt had less of a negative impact on their sex drive. Only 29% of hormonal coil users saw a drop in their sex drive, and patch users just 19%.\nThese figures are much higher than the current scientific evidence would suggest. It’s worth mentioning that people are more likely to leave a review when they have had a negative experience, but this is still really important; the effects of hormonal contraception on libido are under-researched and we need to hear these stories. That being said, it’s less common for positive outcomes to be reported, so we definitely need more research in this area.\nIt’s also really important to remember that, as we said before, sexuality is really complicated. What impacts the libido of one person might have no effect on another, and when it comes to contraception, there is no one-size-fits-all answer.\nWhat should I do if I feel my contraception is affecting my sex drive?\nIf you feel as though your contraception is having a negative impact on your sex drive, you certainly aren’t alone, and you have lots of options available to you.\nAs a first port of call, it’s always good to speak to your GP. They will be able to discuss whether there might be other reasons for any issues you might be facing, and will be able to suggest alternative methods of contraception if they feel it might help.\nWe’d also recommend having a look through our contraception review, to see whether this is something that others have experienced, and whether anyone with similar issues had better results with a different type of contraception.\nSex drive in women is a complex and under-researched area, but one thing is certain: if you feel your contraception is having a negative impact, you don’t have to just put up with it.\n\nThis blog can help you learn more about various contraception options, but it does not give medical advice.

        "Title": "Can mefenamic acid help with heavy and painful periods?",
        "Content": "\nIf you’ve ever tried explaining period pain to a cis man, you know how difficult it can be to describe. It’s something most of us are familiar with, and it can vary from person to person as well as from period to period. \nFor some, though, period pain isn’t a mild monthly annoyance. While the majority of us can fill a hot water bottle and pop a couple of paracetamol, some people experience periods that are so painful, they impact their ability to live their normal lives.\nThere are several treatments that doctors may suggest for especially painful periods, but one which isn’t so well known is mefenamic acid. If ibuprofen isn’t working for your cramps, this might be one to try.\nWe’ll be getting into this in more detail in a moment, but first, let’s explore exactly what period pain is and why most of us experience it.\nWhat is period pain?\nThere’s a reason we refer to period pains as ‘cramps’ – that’s exactly what they feel like. At the beginning of our cycle, when menstruation occurs, our bodies experience a drop in hormones, caused by an egg remaining unfertilised, and respond by shedding the lining of the womb. \nYour womb contracts all the time, but these contractions are usually so mild that you don’t feel them. During your period, however, your womb contracts much more intensely in an effort to push the lining it is shedding out of your body. These contractions push down on the blood vessels within your uterus, momentarily cutting off the blood supply. As a result, the tissues in your womb experience a lack of oxygen, and consequently send out pain-triggering chemicals. Hello, cramps.\nWhat are prostaglandins?\nIf all of that wasn’t enough to take in, there are other players to introduce to the table: prostaglandins. When your body releases the chemicals that trigger pain, it also releases prostaglandins, which are lipids that encourage further contractions and – you guessed it – more pain. Everything’s just one big, lovely cycle, isn’t it?\nWhy do some people experience severe period pain?\nWhen someone experiences frequent and intense cramps during their period, this is known as dysmenorrhea. Dysmenorrhea is an umbrella term that refers simply to the higher level and frequency of pain that one experiences, and can be present on its own (primary dysmenorrhea) or can result from an underlying condition.\nDysmenorrhea can occur as a result of medical conditions such as endometriosis, fibroids, pelvic inflammatory disease or adenomyosis. You can read more about this on the NHS website. As we said earlier, however, some people who menstruate experience dysmenorrhea without an underlying condition.\nThere is evidence that primary dysmenorrhea could be due to increased production and release of prostaglandins. Prostaglandins cause pain at the same time as causing inflammation, a vital part of the healing process that happens all over our bodies. In many women with primary dysmenorrhea, the level of pain they feel during their periods decreases as they get older.\nThere is lots of useful information about dysmenorrhea on the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists’ website.\n\nWhat is Mefenamic Acid?\nMefenamic acid is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). NSAIDs work by blocking an enzyme that the body uses to make prostaglandins. As prostaglandins cause inflammation and trigger pain, preventing them from being created can result in reduced discomfort.\nMefenamic acid for period pain\nMefenamic acid isn’t often prescribed for anything other than period pain, but it is one of the popular choices by doctors as it can control both period pain and heavy bleeding associated with gynaecological conditions. Mefenamic acid is stronger than the ibuprofen that you can buy from a pharmacy, so it is only available via a prescription. Mefenamic acid has been shown to be similarly effective to ibuprofen in the treatment of other painful conditions, but of all the NSAIDs, research still touts ibuprofen as the best option for pain relief with dysmenorrhea. NSAIDs come with side effects, and they’re pretty important to consider.\nWhat are the side effects of Mefenamic Acid?\nNSAIDs in general come with a list of potential side effects. The side effects associated with NSAIDs are known to be more severe if you take a high dosage for a longer period of time. The NHS lists possible side effects of NSAIDs as:\n\nIndigestion\nStomach ulcers\nHeadaches\nDrowsiness\nDizziness\nAllergic reactions\n\nYou should not take NSAIDs if you suffer from asthma or kidney problems.\nMefenamic acid vs ibuprofen for period pain\nStudies have found the effectiveness and side effects of mefenamic acid and ibuprofen to be similar, and one systematic review found no statistical difference between different NSAIDs for these factors. There doesn’t appear to be much evidence that shows that either mefenamic acid or ibuprofen are superior to one another.\nAs an alternative paracetamol is safer than ibuprofen in terms of its side effects and may be worth trying first, but it has shown to be less effective at reducing period pain.\nCan you take mefenamic acid with Ibuprofen?\nNo as they have similar side effects, these medications should not be taken together.\nMefenamic acid vs naproxen for period pain\nStudies have shown that naproxen is slightly more effective than mefenamic acid at reducing pain. It was found to reduce work and school absences due to period pain. They have similar side effects and both are prescription only medications.\n \nWhat other treatments are there for dysmenorrhea and period pain?\nSome find that the intensity of their period pains is reduced with hormonal contraception. Hormonal contraception thins the lining of the uterus, meaning the body needs to produce fewer prostaglandins to cause contractions and shed the lining. Less prostaglandins mean less pain. Hormonal contraception can also alter the intensity of your bleeding, not just the pain associated with it.\nA systematic review of eighteen research studies found that hormonal contraception was the best option, and that NSAIDs should be a first option only for those who did not wish to take hormonal contraception.\n\nSome people will find that their hormonal contraception causes irregular bleeding or spotting within the first few months. This should level out over time. The hormonal IUS (coil) might be the best option for those wanting to reduce their bleeding significantly. A review looking at data from over 2000 women found that the hormonal IUS was more effective than oral contraceptives (the pill) at reducing heavy menstrual bleeding.\nWe recommend checking our reviews to see which contraceptives other women found helpful in reducing period pain, or use our contraception recommender to find the best contraception for you. We also have a blog all about contraception for painful periods, which you might want to take a look at.\n\nCan starflower oil help with period pain?\nStarflower oil is a supplement derived from the borage plant, it contains a high concentration of gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), an omega-6 fatty acid that can reduce inflammation. This means it’s helpful in easing hormonal symptoms associated with PMS, as well as sore boobs and hot flushes. For more information on the benefits of starflower oil, check out our product page to buy directly from us or purchase from Amazon (our affiliate link, checked by doctors!)\nThere are some medication interactions, so have a chat with your GP before starting to take starflower oil if you’re using prescription medications to help with period pain.\nWhen is it time to see a doctor?\nIf you have severe period pain and over-the-counter medications aren’t working, or if you’re noticing other symptoms, it might be time to book an appointment with your GP. \nA variety of symptoms, such as painful sex, bleeding between periods and very heavy periods, could be a sign of an underlying condition. If this is the case, you might have secondary dysmenorrhea (dysmenorrhea caused by another condition) and your doctor will be able to investigate this.\nIf you are experiencing painful periods and want to discuss contraceptives that might help, you can also speak to one of our lovely doctors. They’ll be able to go through your options with you and can offer advice for next steps. You can also order the pill through us, if hormonal contraception is a route you’d like to go down for tackling your painful periods. We have twenty different options to choose from.\nIf you suffer from period pain, you are not alone – one review estimates that 45-97% of women in the UK could have dysmenorrhea. Speak to your doctor and explore your options; what may or may not work for you might take time to figure out, but you don’t have to suffer in silence.\n\nMary Hargreaves is a writer and author with a passion for women’s reproductive health.

        "Title": "Breastfeeding as contraception &#8211; is it reliable?",
        "Content": "\nYou will have to follow a few guidelines if you want to use breastfeeding as contraception: \n\nYour baby is less than six months old\nYou are exclusively (or almost exclusively) breastfeeding day and night\nYour periods have not returned\n\n✔️ If you think you’ll find this blog informative, make sure to check out our newsletter for more:\n\nOne of the lesser-known benefits of breastfeeding is that it can be a form of contraception. Cool, right? So whilst you might not want to jump straight back into bed after having a baby, breastfeeding can give your body a break from other forms of contraception for up to six months.\nWhilst it can be a remarkable 98% effective, breastfeeding as contraception does come with some essential criteria you have to meet (more on this later) if you are to use it as contraception. \nRead on to get the lowdown on the Lactational Amenorrhoea Method and find out if it’s the method for you.\nWhy does breastfeeding prevent pregnancy?\nIf you are exclusively breastfeeding, the hormones produced mean the body naturally stops ovulating, and when you’re not ovulating, you can’t get pregnant. \nIs breastfeeding a reliable form of contraception?\nRelying on your body not to ovulate whilst breastfeeding and using this for contraception is called the rather technical term, Lactational Amenorrhoea Method (LAM). It can be a highly reliable form of contraception, but (and this is a big but) there are a few guidelines that you will have to follow if you want to use breastfeeding as a method of contraception. \nThe main three criteria for LAM are:\n\nYour baby is less than six months old\nYou are exclusively (or almost exclusively) breastfeeding day and night\nYour periods have not returned\n\nIf all these conditions are met, the LAM method is considered 98% effective, similar to well known contraceptive methods like the pill. When the LAM criteria no longer apply you can continue breastfeeding but must switch to an effective method of contraception if you do not wish to become pregnant.\nWhat factors may make breastfeeding as a contraceptive less effective?\nIf you’re not looking to get pregnant again almost straight away after giving birth (we don’t blame you), it’s crucial to consider the factors that may increase your risk of pregnancy if you are using the LAM method, meaning you should switch to an effective method of contraception. These include:  \n\nThe baby feeding less regularly and taking longer intervals between feeds\nThe introduction of supplements to breastmilk such as formula, juice or solids\nUsing a dummy as a comforter\nIllness, stress or anxiety with the mother or baby\nWhen the mother is expressing milk \nWhen the baby is six months old\nWhen menstruation returns\n\n If you’re unsure whether the LAM method would work for you, why not book a consultation with one of our GPs to discuss it further. \nWhat contraception can you use while breastfeeding?\nIf you have your baby in the hospital, a midwife or birth worker will often discuss contraception with you before you go home. This is because it is possible to get pregnant as soon as three weeks after giving birth. If you miss speaking with your midwife, your GP or health visitor should be on hand to discuss your options. Our in-house GPs at The Lowdown are also a friendly ear to discuss any contraception questions you might have postpartum. You can book a GP consultation here.  \nThere are various methods of contraception you can use after giving birth, but it’s important to note that with some, you will have to wait longer to start after giving birth or if you’re breastfeeding. \n\nOptions for contraception whilst breastfeeding\nIt is ok to use the following contraception options when breastfeeding and immediately after birth:\n\nThe progestogen-only pill\nMale and female condoms\nThe contraceptive implant\nThe contraceptive injection\nThe hormonal coil (IUS) – must be inserted within 48 hours of birth\nThe copper coil (IUD) – must be inserted within 48 hours of birth\n\nContraceptives you can use at three weeks after birth (only if you’re NOT breastfeeding)\n\nContraceptive patch\nCombined pill\nVaginal ring\n\nContraceptives you can use at six weeks after birth (if you are breastfeeding)\n\nContraceptive patch\nCombined pill\nVaginal ring\n\n\nWhat effect does breastfeeding have on contraception?\nWhilst you are breastfeeding, the fertility signs associated with ovulation will often be reduced and ovulation may not occur regularly. This can make fertility awareness based methods of contraception unreliable and you may want to consider other options whilst breastfeeding. \nBreastfeeding can also affect the risk of a coil going through the uterus wall (perforating). The risk of perforation after any coil insertion is usually around 1-2 in 1000, but this can be increased by as much as six times if you are breastfeeding. Now bear with us whilst we get a bit more technical here, but if we break this down with timings, the risk is 5.6 in 1000 during the first 36 weeks after delivery and 1.6 in 1000 over 36 weeks after delivery (basically back to the standard risk). So some may choose to wait. \nHealthcare practitioners may advise against breastfeeding for around three hours after a coil insertion. This isn’t based on any particular guidance but is due to breastfeeding releasing a hormone that can contract the uterus and possibly increase the risk of expulsion or perforation. \nWe still love the coil at The Lowdown, but also believe you need to be fully informed about all of this and speak with your doctor to make your own decision.\nWhat effect does hormonal contraception have on breastfeeding?\nCurrent research shows that progestogen-only contraceptive methods do not affect milk supply or your baby’s growth or development. But whilst this research is clear, the information for the combined hormonal pill is less clear, with concerns that the oestrogen may reduce breast milk supply – especially if it is started within six weeks after delivery. \nThere have been extensive reviews examining these studies, which determine that the research isn’t high enough quality and may have been affected by data from women who were using old fashioned types and doses of the combined pill. At The Lowdown, we’re confident that the research shows your baby’s growth and development isn’t affected by the combined pill – so if your baby is more than six weeks old and it’s your number one choice while breastfeeding and safe for you, then go ahead.\n\nHow soon after birth can you get pregnant?\nIt is possible to get pregnant as soon as three weeks or 21 days after birth. \nCan I take emergency contraception while breastfeeding?\nYes. If you do not meet the criteria for LAM you may want to consider emergency contraception following unprotected sex. \nThe morning after pill, Levonelle is one of the more common brands of emergency contraception. Whilst a small amount of hormones from the pill may pass into breast milk, it is not harmful to your baby. \nEllaOne is another common morning-after pill but it’s safety during breastfeeding has not been studied. It is therefore advised to avoid breastfeeding for a week after using ellaOne and milk should be expressed and discarded during that time. Check out this piece, where we discuss everything you need to know about the morning-after pill. \nThe copper IUD is the most effective form of contraception and women may want to consider this whilst they are breastfeeding, taking into account the small increased risk of perforation and depending on suitability. \nCheck out our very own Dr Fran’s blog where she spills the T on contraception after giving birth (before heading off on maternity leave *sad face*).\nHatty is a freelance digital marketing consultant with over 10 years experience.

        "Content": "\nWhat’s the lowdown?\n\n\n \n\nLife’s a funny thing; one week you’re on top of everything, clear-headed and totally fine, the next you’re weeping because you stood on a snail in the car park of Asda. \nIntroducing PMS, the monthly friend of millions of women and people who menstruate. It’s responsible for the symptoms you may notice before your period – whether physical or mental – and the severity of its impact varies from person to person.\nOn the lower end of the spectrum, you might experience bloating and light mood swings. At the other end is PMDD (Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder), which can have a significant impact on the ability to carry out normal life and activities.\nHere we’ll dive deep into both conditions, looking at the symptoms, possible causes and treatments. We’ll also answer the question: can contraception help?\nThink this blog will be useful? Check out our newsletter for more:\n\nSymptoms of PMS and PMDD\nPremenstrual Syndrome (PMS) is an umbrella term for a variety of symptoms you may experience in the days or weeks leading up to your period. The most common include:\n\nBloating\nCramps\nBreast tenderness\nMood swings (feeling more upset, angry, anxious or irritable)\nSpots and greasier skin\nGreasy hair\nHeadaches\nTiredness or insomnia\nAppetite changes\nReduced or heightened sex drive\n\nNot everyone experiences all of these symptoms, and they vary in intensity from person to person. Some will recognise their own combination of signals that tell them their period is due; and some months these might be intense, while others you may barely notice them. The lucky ones might not get any symptoms at all (#blessed).\nPremenstrual Dysphoric Disorder is a severe form of PMS, and is a diagnosable condition. It has more severe symptoms and a significant impact on daily functioning. It affects around 1 in 20 women.\nSymptoms occur a week or two before your period starts and generally subside a few days after the start of your period. Symptoms include:\n\n Lasting irritability or anger that may affect other people\nFeelings of sadness or despair, or even thoughts of suicide\nFeelings of tension or anxiety including tingling in the hands and feet\nPanic attacks\nMood swings or crying often\nLack of interest in daily activities and relationships\nTrouble thinking or focusing\nTiredness or low energy\nFood cravings or binge eating\nTrouble sleeping\nFeeling out of control\nPhysical symptoms such as cramps, bloating, breast tenderness, headaches, and joint or muscle pain\n\nTo be diagnosed with PMDD you must have 5+ symptoms, including one mood-related symptom, e.g. mood swings, feelings of sadness or anxiety.\n\nWhat causes PMS and PMDD?\nScientists aren’t actually 100% clear about exactly what causes PMS and PMDD, but there are a few theories as to why it happens.\nHormonal changes\nHormones follow a cycle – they ebb and flow throughout the month, and your mood and body responds accordingly. After ovulation, and before your period begins, oestrogen and progesterone rise. Higher levels of these hormones can cause anxiety, irritability and mood swings. Once your period begins, these hormones drop off, and symptoms of PMS or PMDD tend to disappear. \nOne very small study looked at 18 women who had been diagnosed with PMS. They found that those with higher levels of oestrogen and progesterone during the luteal phase of their cycle (the time after ovulation but before a period) had more severe symptoms of PMS and lower mood. \nWhat isn’t clear, however, is whether one of these hormones is more responsible for PMS or PMDD symptoms than the other. The science suggests that progesterone might be the main culprit, but this doesn’t necessarily mean that higher progesterone equals stronger symptoms. The more likely answer, according to research, lies in how and when progesterone levels are high in the body.\nA study from the 90s found that progesterone was necessary early after ovulation for PMS to occur, while more recent research suggests that people with severe PMS or PMDD experience a sharp drop in progesterone in the final days before their period. Those without PMS symptoms, in comparison, had a slow and gradual decline in progesterone during this time.\nIt’s also true that some people who menstruate are simply more sensitive to hormonal changes than others. If you’ve ever reacted badly to a new contraceptive pill that everyone else seems to love, you know what we mean.\nChanges to brain chemistry\nThere is a chemical in your brain called serotonin, and it interacts with lots of different parts of your body all the time. It is thought that one of its roles is to regulate your mood and emotions; contributing to happiness and keeping anxiety and low mood in check. \nIn people experiencing PMS or PMDD, serotonin drops as oestrogen drops at the end of the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle just before your period starts. Some scientists think, then, that this reduction in serotonin can impact your mood and be responsible for the emotional symptoms of PMS and PMDD. \nIt is also thought that women with major depression are more susceptible to PMDD than those who have moderate or no depression.\nEssentially, we still don’t have a definitive answer as to why PMS and PMDD occur. Oestrogen, progesterone and serotonin are all thought to play a role, but it is difficult to tease apart the effects of each.\n\nCan contraception help with PMS and PMDD?\nFor some, yes. Research has found that newer types of combined contraceptive pill, which contain drospirenone, can improve PMS symptoms. For those suffering with PMDD, the research is encouraging, and suggests it could help in some cases. \nThis type of pill may be the first treatment most people who menstruate are offered when they see their doctor about PMS or PMDD, and they may be advised to take it continuously to improve symptom management. \nThe pill works for some people because it levels out the hormonal fluctuations we experience throughout our cycle. With progestogen and oestrogen spikes both being potential culprits for the symptoms some of us experience before our periods, it makes sense that ironing these out could have an impact on how we feel. The pill prevents ovulation (and therefore the subsequent hormone spike), and when it’s taken continuously, oestrogen and progestogen won’t suddenly drop before your withdrawal bleed in your pill free week, which might lessen PMS or PMDD symptoms. \nUnfortunately, there’s no umbrella treatment for PMS or PMDD, and a contraceptive pill that works for one person may not work for another.\nWhat about other methods that stop ovulation?\nYou might be wondering about progestogen-only contraception, like the mini pill, injection or hormonal coil. They can also stop ovulation, so it would make sense that they could have the same effect, right? Well, maybe not.\nProgestogen-only contraception can alter the way you bleed each month. Some people may stop bleeding altogether, while others might experience spotting or irregular bleeding. It may be that progestogen-only contraception, if it stops periods altogether, may help PMS in some individuals but it can also reproduce symptoms in others. Progesterone or progestogens or therefore not considered suitable treatment for PMS symptoms. \nSo what’s the best contraceptive pill for PMS and PMDD?\nYasmin, Lucette, Eloine and Drovelis are all contraceptive pills containing synthetic oestrogen and drosperinone, which is thought to improve PMS and PMDD symptoms. You can now buy Yasmin and other contraceptive pills here at The Lowdown.\nCan contraception make PMS or PMDD worse?\nWhile some find that contraception improves their symptoms, others find that it actually makes them worse. Some side effects of contraception, like bloating, breast tenderness and cramps, are also the symptoms of PMS and PMDD, so it can be hard to tease apart the two.\nWhen it comes to mood symptoms of PMS and PMDD, the effect of contraception is also unclear. One study of 658 women taking oral contraception found that more reported a deterioration in PMS symptoms than an improvement. On the other hand, a study of almost a thousand women in Southampton found that use of hormonal contraception was associated with a lower prevalence of PMS symptoms.  \nAnnoyingly, there still doesn’t seem to be an answer as to whether hormonal contraception in general improves or worsens PMS or PMDD. This is perhaps because there never will be an answer; as frustrating as it is, everyone is different, and our sensitivity to hormonal changes, as well as the unique balance of hormones in our bodies, mean that we will all react differently.\nIf you’d like to discuss contraceptive options for managing PMS or PMDD, The Lowdown offers online consultations with their medical team; essentially a 20 minute chat with a professional who specialises in contraception, who can talk you through your options and create a personalised action plan.\n\nIs there anything else that can help with PMS or PMDD?\nIf you’re here because you suffer with PMS or PMDD and are looking for answers, you’ve probably heard the ‘diet, exercise, lots of sleep’ advice a thousand times. We all know that these things are good for us, but sometimes they’re not enough. The NHS has a great page about lifestyle adjustments you can make, but if your symptoms persist, it’s time to see your GP.\nPain relief\nFor light, physical PMS symptoms you may want to try at-home pain relief such as paracetamol or ibuprofen. \nCognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)\nYou may want to discuss CBT with your health professional. This is a talking therapy which can help you to manage PMS symptoms and to address the emotional and psychological side of what you’re going through. It should be offered to everyone with severe PMS. You can access this through your GP on the NHS. Alternatively ThinkCBT is an expert online and in person CBT therapy organisation. They work with many NHS organisations, as well as privately. You can use the access code ‘LowDown’ for a discount.* ; \nAntidepressants\nYou may also be prescribed low dose antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Remember we talked about serotonin and its potential role in PMS? These could help to regulate the levels of serotonin in your brain and may work to alleviate the psychological symptoms of your PMS or PMDD. Your GP can discuss the option of taking these every day or just in the lead up to your period.\nBefore visiting your GP\nYou might want to keep a symptom diary over a few months, alongside tracking your menstrual cycle, and bring this with you to your GP appointment or Lowdown consultation. This will help your doctor to understand whether you have PMDD, or whether you need help for PMS. \nThere are a few useful and free apps you can download to track your symptoms easily:\n\nMe v PMDD\nClue\n\nIf you prefer to use a pen and paper, there is also a pre-prepared sheet you can print off called the Daily Record of Severity of Problems. You may also find this Self-Screen Tool useful if you’re unsure of your symptoms, but you should always seek help from a professional if you’re at all concerned.\nIf none of the above treatment options work, you may be referred on to a specialist who can better assess your needs.\nIf you would like to know more or need support, check out the National Association for Premenstrual Syndromes,  International Association of Premenstrual Disorder, Mind Website, and UK PMDD Support Group.\n*We have a relationship with this brand so may get a small introducer fee if you use this link\nMary Hargreaves is a writer and author with a passion for women’s reproductive health.

        "Content": "\n✔️ If you think you’ll find this blog informative, subscribe to our newsletter for more:\n\nThere are two kinds of oral contraceptive pill: the combined pill and the progestogen-only pill (or mini pill). The combined pill has traditionally followed a 21/7 format which means taking 21 days of active hormones followed by a seven day break from pills, or 7 inactive pills, repeat.\nGuidance issued in 2020, however, states that taking a combined oral contraceptive birth control pill back to back is perfectly safe and, science suggests, actually more effective than taking it for 21 days at a time with seven-day breaks in between.\nMaking sure you’re taking your pill correctly can be confusing at times, but it doesn’t have to be! If you‘d like to chat to one of The Lowdown’s doctors about your experience on the combined birth control pill so far and what the best contraception might be for you to help manage your periods, you can book an appointment here. Or, you can use our contraception recommender tool to advise you further on which contraceptive is best for you:\n\nWhat types of hormonal contraception can you take continuously?\nMost progestogen-only (mini) pills are taken continually anyway, so just keep doing your thing. You can buy the progestogen-only pill (including the mini pills Hana, Noriday and Desogestrel) here at The Lowdown.\nIf you’re taking a combined oral contraceptive pill like Yasmin, Microgynon contraceptive pill or Rigevidon however, or if you’re using another form of combined contraception, like the vaginal ring or the patch, listen up.\nHow do I use the birth control pill to skip bleeds?\nIf you use pills that come in a 21 day packet, it’s easy, just don’t have a break between packs and move straight into another packet. If you use 28 day pill packets which include both active and inactive or reminder pills (which are usually a different colour), just skip the last 4 to 7 different coloured pills in the packet and move straight onto another packet, starting with the active pills.\nBy ignoring the inactive pills or skipping the break you won’t be induced to have a withdrawal bleed….yippee!\nIs taking the pill back to back safe?\nResearch shows that taking the combined contraceptive pill back to back is absolutely safe. In fact, there’s no evidence at all that shows any health benefits associated with the seven-day break and withdrawal bleed. \nThe Family Planning Association now explicitly states that withdrawal bleeds hold no known benefits, and that there are no risks associated with missing them altogether.\nSome women are understandably concerned about taking their pill continuously and missing their ‘period’. The reality, though, is that the bleed you experience during your seven-day break isn’t a period at all. \nAllow us to go back to basics for a second. When you aren’t taking hormonal contraception or birth control, the lining of your uterus thickens throughout the middle and end of your cycle, readying itself for a fertilised egg to be implanted. When fertilisation doesn’t happen, the lining sheds, and this is your period. \nCombined hormonal contraception, on the other hand, prevents your ovaries from releasing an egg, and stops the lining of the uterus from thickening as it would during your ordinary cycle. The aptly-named ‘withdrawal bleed’ you experience during your seven-day break is just that: your body’s response to the withdrawal of the hormones contained in your pill.\nIn short, withdrawal bleeds are completely unnecessary in terms of their effect on your health or the effectiveness of your contraception. We know – mind-blowing. \nThis is also true for the contraceptive patch and the vaginal ring, both of which administer oestrogen and progestogen, traditionally in a 21/7 format.\n\nCheck out more Trustpilot reviews of The Lowdown here!\nWhat are the benefits of taking the combined pill continuously?\nIt can make your pill more effective\nEven more interestingly, taking your pill continuously might actually improve how effective it is. When you take the pill, you’re essentially putting your ovaries to sleep, interrupting your cycle and preventing pregnancy. After the seven-day break or inactive reminder pills, your ovaries ‘wake up’ again, so if you were to forget to take your pill for a couple of days afterwards, your risk of pregnancy would increase.\nIt can reduce the side effects of the pill\nThe side effects of taking your pill continuously shouldn’t be any different from those of taking the pill in general, but this type of ‘tailored’ contraception taking might alleviate some of the less desirable symptoms of your withdrawal week.\nLike we said earlier, the bleed you experience during the break in your pill doesn’t actually need to happen; it provides no benefits to your health or the effectiveness of your contraception. While this bleed isn’t a period, it may come with some similar symptoms (pain, PMS, headaches) which are lessened or eliminated when you don’t have a break. You might still experience some bleeding or spotting with continuous pill taking, but this should lessen over time¹.\nIf you’re having trouble with side effects from the pill, have tried a few but can’t find one that suits you, or just want a bit more guidance on your contraception options, our team of Lowdown GPs can help!\nIt’s easier to remember\nIt’s also easier to remember to take a pill every day (no more snoozing those phone alarms for a week every month), meaning there’s less risk of you forgetting and reducing its effectiveness against pregnancy.\nThis kind of pill-taking, where the pill is administered differently to the advice on the box, is called ‘tailored combined hormonal contraception’. It’s outside the manufacturer’s license, meaning they can’t direct you to take it in this way, but it is supported by the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare, who write the rules about how contraception is used in the UK. Continuous combined birth control pills were also approved by the FDA in the US in 2007.\n\nYou can skip a period (and say goodbye to bleeds)\nWe’re sure you don’t need us to list the benefits of not bleeding every month (no sanitary products, white jeans, yes please) but for most of us, the withdrawal bleed is mistakenly seen as a reassuring sign that our contraception is actually working.\nCombined hormonal contraception, however – when taken correctly – is incredibly effective. Add to this the fact that your chances of missing a pill are reduced when it’s taken back to back, and the increased efficacy when your seven-day break is missed, and your chances of pregnancy are very slim. \nWithdrawal bleeds are also not a normal period and have been reported by people using combined methods of contraception who are pregnant. You should not consider having monthly bleeds on combined contraception to be reassurance that you are not pregnant.\nIf there’s no benefit to the 7-day break, why was the pill developed this way in the first place? \nWell, some say that it was to help get approval from the Pope, as the body would still be following its ‘natural’ rhythm. Mostly, however, it’s due to the fixed mindset at the time the pill was developed: having monthly bleeds was seen as ‘normal’ and, incorrectly, necessary. \nHow long can you keep taking the pill back to back?\nCurrent research doesn’t point to any time limits for continuous pill taking; in fact, a 2018 paper² actually recommended ditching the 7-day withdrawal altogether and adopting a continuous regimen. For women who prefer a monthly bleed, the researchers recommended a 4-day break or 4-days of inactive reminder pills, as this was deemed more effective in terms of pregnancy prevention than a 7-day withdrawal.\nThere is also no evidence to show that missing breaks occasionally is less safe than missing them altogether.  \nCheck out the ‘Pill taking’ highlight on our Instagram stories for an overview of this and a fascinating interview with Professor John Guillebaud, who has been campaigning for more education on back-to-back pill taking for years.\n\nCheck out more of our Trustpilot reviews here!\nWhat do I do if I keep getting breakthrough bleeding?\nSome irregular bleeding and spotting are totally normal during the first few months of continuous pill taking. This does tend to lessen over time, though, and most women find that it becomes less of an issue when it does occur. \nIf you’ve had spotting or bleeding for more than a few days, and it hasn’t settled after 21 consecutive days of beginning the pill (or three weeks after an earlier break), stop taking the pill for four days before beginning again. After the four days have passed, start a new pack from the pill that matches the current day, throwing away the ones from the days you missed. \nYou don’t need to contact your healthcare provider before trying this way of taking the pill, and it usually works to lessen or stop any bleeding or spotting. If it doesn’t settle, however, do check out our blog on spotting on contraception and when you should see your GP. \nIf you do decide to take a four-day or seven-day break, there’s no need to use any other forms of contraception; as long as you’ve taken 21 consecutive active pills, your pill will continue to protect you against pregnancy.\nMy doctor/pharmacist hasn’t heard of continuous pill taking – what should I do?\nThe push for more women to have the option of taking the combined pill back to back is relatively recent, and unfortunately it can take time for changes in guidance to reach GPs and other healthcare providers. \nIf your doctor or pharmacist hasn’t heard of the new guidelines, download the Family Planning Association’s leaflet⁴ about combined contraception and take it with you, referencing pages 11 and 12.\nDon’t be shy in telling them that the guidance has changed; your healthcare provider will want to work with you to make sure you’re making the most informed choice!\n\nMary Hargreaves is a writer and author with a passion for women’s reproductive health.

        "Content": "\nHi my name is Sarah Panzetta and I help women and their partners use fertility awareness as contraception. Many of the women I work with have been nervous about the vaccine and I don’t blame them.\nWomen are often overlooked in research, and their concerns dismissed, however, the research on the Covid jab is strong and so I do encourage you to get it.\nThat said, it’s worth knowing there’s a good chance that you might have a month or two of disrupted cycles after the vaccine. I’ve seen this with many of my clients – delayed ovulation meaning delayed periods, and sometimes a cycle where there are no signs of ovulation.\nThat might sound scary but it’s completely normal to have a disrupted cycle or delayed ovulation now and again. It’s a fairly common response to illness and stressful or exciting times like holidays, exams, deadlines, or job interviews.\n\nFortunately, handling disrupted cycles is a standard part of using fertility awareness as contraception. You don’t just rely on a period tracker to work out when you’re fertile, you use a mixture of fertility indicators. Most will use waking temperature alongside cervical fluid, ovulation tests or cervix checks.\nAs well as that, you make sure you’re poised to use condoms or other precautions for as long as you need to. Delayed ovulation, or no ovulation, means more condom days, but like I said this is a temporary thing. Play the long game – look after yourself and things will usually improve.\nNotes:\nTo find out more about using fertility awareness as contraception visit the NHS website\nSarah Panzetta has been a Fertility UK Fertility Awareness Practitioner since 2011. Since then she has taught many women (and their partners) about fertility awareness, including religious couples, single women, women who’ve had abortions and women with tricky cycles thanks to health issues.

STIs, STDs, chlamydia, gonorrhoea – just a whisper of one of these words and we’re immediately transported back to flustered school nurses, unripe bananas and paper sachets of assorted condoms.\nIf you weren’t listening back then (and let’s face it, who was?) it might be time to brush up on your knowledge of STIs – so let’s get into it.\n\nWhat is an STI?\nA sexually transmitted infection (also known as an STD, or sexually transmitted disease) is an infection that is passed from one human being to another through sexual contact. Most STIs are passed along when one person’s genitals come into contact with another person’s genitals or mouth.\nLike any infection, once the virus, bacteria or parasite has been passed on, it begins to multiply and have effects on the body. Some of these can be seen in obvious symptoms, but some are hard to detect without a test, so it’s important to be vigilant and get tested regularly if you’re sexually active (more on this later).\nProtecting yourself from STIs\nBefore we dive deep into the world of the most common STIs, let’s look at how we can prevent them in the first place. STIs need physical contact to spread –  that means they aren’t airborne and won’t be passed along through clothes.\nWith that in mind, the only contraceptives that can protect you from most STIs are those which create a barrier between your body and that of the other person. These methods of contraception are, appropriately, called barrier methods, but only two provide good protection against STIs: the female condom and the male condom.\nAs a contraceptive, the male condom is more effective at preventing pregnancy than the female condom, and is also favoured for protecting against STIs because it’s generally easier to use correctly, so there’s less room for accidents to happen.\nSome STIs, like herpes, gonorrhoea and syphilis, can be passed along orally. This happens when one person’s anus or genitals comes into contact with another person’s mouth. If you or your partner have any cuts or sores on your mouth or genitalia, it’s much easier for an STI to be passed on. The male condom can protect against most STIs during oral sex involving the penis, the lesser-known oral condom (also known as a, dare we say it, tonguedom) or dental dam could protect you during oral sex involving the vagina, but research is limited as to how effective these methods are.\nThere is a common misconception that, during sexual contact, if you don’t have penetrative sex or if the man doesn’t ejaculate (come), an STI can’t be passed on. This is untrue; STIs  can also be present in pre-ejaculate (pre-come) in genital fluids, and be passed on through skin to skin contact, so condoms should be used from the moment sexual contact occurs. Similarly, if you’re sharing sex toys with your partner, make sure they’re washed thoroughly before us\nSome STIs are easier to catch through anal sex than it is through other forms of sexual contact. This is because the lining of the anus is fragile, and can therefore break easily, leaving it more susceptible to infection. Condoms are your best bet for protecting yourself against STIs during anal sex, and if you use lube during any sexual contact, make sure it’s silicone or water-based. Oil-based lubricants can cause the condom to break. Get Yes water-based lube from Amazon (we earn a small commission from your purchase on this link!)\nHow soon after unprotected sex should I have an STI check up?\nThe answer to this is as soon as possible if you have any symptoms which may suggest an STI. However if you have no symptoms and are considering doing a screening test, it is important to think about STI ‘window periods’. \nThe ‘window period’ is the length of time it can take between catching an infection and when we can be sure it will show up on a test. The window period for the most common STI tests are:\n\nChlamydia and Gonorrhoea – 2 weeks\nHIV – 45 days (if tested in a clinic) or 90 days (if self testing)\nSyphilis – 12 weeks\n\nIf you are having a check-up it is still worth having the tests even if you are in the ‘window period’ – but you may be advised to repeat the test after the ‘window period’ to be sure.\nNow that’s out of the way, let’s look at a few of the most common STIs in more detail.\nChlamydia\nAlongside gonorrhoea and HIV, chlamydia is one of the most well-known STIs, and is the most common across Europe and the United States. According to a government report, in 2019 Chlamydia made up 49% of all diagnosed STIs – that’s more than triple that of the second-most common STI, Gonorrhoea. \nAs with most STIs, it’s more prevalent in younger people, as they are more likely to have multiple sexual partners, but can affect anyone at any age. \nTransmission\nChlamydia is spread through sexual contact. Chlamydia can infect the genitals, rectum or throat. To add an extra complication to the mix, you can also get a chlamydial eye infection if semen or vaginal fluid gets in your eye. \nSymptoms\nCommon symptoms of chlamydia in women and people with vaginas include pain when peeing, unusual discharge from the vagina or anus, abdominal pain, bleeding after sex and bleeding between periods. \nThat being said, you often can’t rely on symptoms to tell you whether you have chlamydia. A whopping 75% of cases in women are asymptomatic (meaning you can have the infections and have no symptoms at all), so it’s hugely important to get tested if you’ve had unprotected sex with a new partner. It can be caught more than once, so even if you have had it and have been treated before, it’s important to be careful and use protection.\nIf you treat chlamydia quickly, it’s unlikely to cause you any problems. If it is left untreated, however, it can lead to infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease and reactive arthritis – pretty serious stuff.\nTesting and Diagnosis\nTesting for chlamydia is easy, quick and painless. This can be done at a sexual health clinic, GP surgery or at home. Anyone with a vagina should do a self taken vaginal swab and anyone with a penis should do a urine sample into a cup (2 hours after you last passed urine). If you’ve had anal sex then you can also do a self taken anal swab.\nYour sample will then be sent off to a lab, and you should get your results within a week to ten days. If you think you might have been exposed to chlamydia (i.e. if you are being tested because you know your partner has chlamydia, as opposed to just having regular screening) you might be asked to start treatment before your results come in.\nThe NHS recommends that all under-25s should get tested at least once a year, and every time they change sexual partners. If you’re under 25, you can get tested by the National Chlamydia Screening Programme (NCSP) at a pharmacy, contraception clinic or at some colleges. \nYou can also get home-testing kits through the NHS or by buying them online. Through the post, you will be sent a urine pot to pee in, or instructions about how to do a self-swab, which you can then send back to the laboratory by following the instructions on the specific kit you buy. It’s important that you buy your kit from a reputable retailer, and you should read the NHS guidance about self-testing before you order.\nTreatment\nChlamydia is treated using antibiotics. Your doctor or nurse will usually prescribe you doxycycline, which you take twice a day for a week. 95% of people will be cured of chlamydia if they take their antibiotics as instructed.\nHow long until chlamydia goes away?\nWith treatment, chlamydia should clear up within 1-2 weeks. You shouldn’t have any sexual contact with another person during this time, as you could still pass it on to your partner. You also shouldn’t have sex with your partner  – including vaginal, oral or anal sex, even with a condom – until both you and your partner (or partners) have completed treatment, otherwise you risk reinfection!\n\nGonorrhoea\nGonorrhoea, otherwise known as ‘the clap’, is becoming more difficult to treat effectively with antibiotics – it’s the second-most common STI, making up 15% of all new diagnoses in 2019.\nTransmission\nLike all STIs, gonorrhoea is passed on through sexual contact. This means that if you have anal, oral or vaginal sex with an infected person, you could catch it. Similarly to chlamydia it can infect the genitals, rectum, and less commonly the throat or eye. It can be caught more than once, so even if you have had it and have been treated before, it’s important to be careful and use protection.\nSymptoms\nGonorrhoea is infamous for its unpleasant symptoms – thick, green or yellow discharge from the vagina or penis, as well as pain during urination. Women and people with vaginas can also experience bleeding between periods and pelvic pain.\nLike chlamydia, however, gonorrhoea can have no symptoms in a large number of cases. Around 10% of men and 50% of women will experience no symptoms, so it’s really important to get tested if you think you might have had sexual contact with an infected person, even if you feel totally fine.\nIf you leave gonorrhoea untreated, it can lead to serious health problems that are difficult to treat, such as Pelvic Inflammatory Disease. So if you are diagnosed, it’s important that you start treatment as soon as you can.\nTesting and Diagnosis\nAs with chlamydia, testing for gonorrhoea in people with no symptoms can be done with self taken swabs or a urine sample if you have a penis. If you have symptoms such as pain, vaginal discharge or discharge from the penis you need to attend a sexual health clinic for an examination. This will involve a swab of the affected area which can be looked at under a microscope to identify the gonorrhoea bacteria. \nYou can get tested at your GP surgery, a sexual health clinic or from a private healthcare provider. You can buy a test online or from a pharmacy, but the NHS recommends you go to a specialised clinic, as at-home tests aren’t always consistently accurate. If you do decide to self-test, be sure that the retailer is reputable, and read the NHS guidance on self-testing before you buy anything. \nTreatment\nGonorrhoea is treated with antibiotics. Usually, a single antibiotic injection is given. Two weeks after you are treated, you should get tested again to check that the infection has gone. This is important as there are increasingly cases of gonorrhoea resistant to standard treatment. \nYou should refrain from sexual contact with anybody until you test negative for Gonorrhoea after treatment. You also shouldn’t have sex with your partner until both you and your partner (or partners) have completed treatment.\nHow long until gonorrhoea goes away?\nWith treatment, symptoms of gonorrhoea should go away within a few days. If you have pain in your pelvis or abdomen, this might take a further two weeks to disappear completely and you should be offered a follow up appointment to check this with your doctor or nurse. \nTrichomoniasis\nTrichomoniasis is caused by a parasite that only lives in the human genital tract (not where we’d pick as our dream home location, but each to their own). It isn’t super common, with only 6000 cases reported each year, but is still something to watch out for.\nTransmission\nTrichomoniasis is transmitted through sexual contact with the penis, vagina or urethra. It is not thought that you can pass trichomoniasis on through oral or anal sex. It can be caught more than once, so even if you have had it and have been treated before, it’s important to be careful and use protection.\nSymptoms\nOver half the people infected with trichomoniasis will have no symptoms at all. In women, symptoms might include discharge that is abnormal in quantity and consistency or has a fishy smell, soreness around the vagina, and pain when peeing or having sex. \nIn men, trichomoniasis rarely causes symptoms but they can include discharge from the end of the penis, an increased need to urinate, burning when peeing and a soreness, swelling or itchiness around the head of the penis.\nTesting and Diagnosis\nTrichomonas is not tested for in routine STI screening for people who have no symptoms. However if you have symptoms such as vaginal discharge or pain on passing urine and you attend a sexual health clinic, your doctor or nurse will usually conduct an examination, and test for trichomonas. The symptoms of trichomoniasis are similar to those of other STIs, so it can be hard to diagnose. \nYour doctor or nurse might also take a swab of the inside of your vagina (or penis, if you’ve got one). Men can also give a urine sample. The sample will then be sent to a lab, and it may take several days for a result to come through. In sexual health clinics a diagnosis can be made looking at a sample from a swab under a microscope. \nIf your doctor or nurse strongly thinks you have trichomoniasis, you may be advised to begin treatment before your lab results come back.\nTreatment\nAs with most STIs, trichomoniasis is treated with antibiotics. Metronidazole is most likely to be prescribed, to be taken twice a day for five to seven days. You might sometimes be advised to take the full course all at once, but this can increase the side effects of the medicine and isn’t recommended if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.\nHow long until trichomoniasis goes away\nTrichomoniasis should clear up within a week of treatment. You shouldn’t have sex until at least a week after your treatment has begun, and until both you and your partner or partners have completed treatment.\nHIV\nHIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a viral infection that is passed on through sexual contact. The virus attacks the cells that help the body to fight off infection, and if it is left untreated, it can lead to late HIV, also known as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS.\nHIV wasn’t actually discovered until 1981, and quickly became an epidemic. Due to the virus disproportionately affecting men who have sex with men and the Black African population, the origins of HIV are rooted in discrimination and stigma, much of which is sadly still present today. The fact is that HIV can affect anyone! According to research, anal sex is 18 times more likely to result in HIV being transmitted than vaginal sex. This is because the lining of the anus is fragile, and can therefore break easily, leaving it more susceptible to infection.\nA campaign called ‘Undetectable = Untransmittable’ or ‘U=U’ aims to raise awareness about the ways in which the transmission of HIV can be stopped. If a person receives treatment, it can lower the viral load in the blood to a level that makes the disease untransmittable. Spreading this message is important and helps tackle the stigma around HIV and barriers to testing. \nAnyone can get HIV, and while rates in the UK are consistently declining, protecting yourself is just as important as it ever was.\nTransmission\nMost cases of HIV are passed on through unprotected (without a condom) vaginal or anal sex. It is possible to contract HIV from oral sex, but this is very rare. Your risk of contracting or passing on HIV from oral sex is higher if you have cuts, sores or ulcers in your mouth or other STIs as the same time. \nThe more recently a person has been infected with HIV, the higher the chances they will pass it on. This is because, at the beginning of the infection, there is a large quantity of the virus within the body.\nSymptoms\nMost people infected with HIV will experience a period of illness within 2-6 weeks of becoming infected. This illness will feel like the flu, and symptoms include a sore throat, a fever or a rash on the body. After a week or two, these symptoms should disappear, and you might not have any other HIV symptoms for many years. \nDuring this time, the virus continues to attack the body’s immune system. This could continue for up to a decade, during which time you might feel and seem perfectly well. At some point, the immune system will become badly damaged and more severe symptoms will occur, such as weight loss, diarrhoea, infection and extreme illness.\nTesting and Diagnosis\nIf you think you have been exposed to HIV, it is important that you get tested as soon as possible. HIV testing is always free on the NHS, and can be done at home, at a sexual health clinic, at private clinics or at some GP surgeries. \nA HIV test is conducted using a sample of your blood or saliva. The most reliable test is a blood test, where a sample of your blood will be sent to a laboratory for analysis. You can also give a sample of your saliva or a small drop of blood from the end of your finger. These tests can be conducted at a clinic or at home, and result times vary depending on the method. Tests may also need to be repeated. You can see all the testing options on the NHS website.\nTreatment\nIf you think you have been exposed to HIV within the last 72 hours, you can take a post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) drug, which could prevent you from becoming infected. This is available from sexual health clinics or emergency departments. For groups at high risk of exposure, PreP (pre exposure prophylaxis) is also an option. This is where someone who is HIV negative can take medicine before they have sex to reduce the risk of acquiring HIV. \nThere is currently no cure for HIV, but treatments are available that can allow an infected person to live a full and healthy life. If you are diagnosed with HIV, your healthcare provider will want to conduct blood tests to monitor the amount of the virus in your body and the effects it has already had on your immune system. Once these have been established, treatment can begin.\nHIV is treated using Antiretroviral medicine. These medicines stop the virus from multiplying in your body, giving your immune system time to repair itself and stopping any further damage from occurring. The HIV virus adapts and changes quickly, so people often have their treatment changed or combined from time to time to ensure it is still effective. Every HIV patient is different in how their body responds to treatment, so your exact combination will be personal to you.\nYou can see a full explanation of HIV treatment on the NHS website.\nHow long until HIV goes away?\nThere is currently no cure for HIV. Thanks to advances in medicine, however, people can now live full and normal lives with HIV if they seek treatment.\nSyphilis\nSyphilis is an STI that is passed on through direct sexual contact.\nIt is not clear exactly when or where syphilis originated from, but there have been outbreaks throughout history, often with each country blaming another for causing the epidemic.\nCases of syphilis have actually almost tripled over the last decade, and most often occur in men (with the highest rates among men who have sex with men), who made up 90% of the cases in 2019.\nTransmission\nSyphilis is a bacterial infection that is passed on through direct contact with a ‘chancre’, a sore caused by syphilis. These sores appear in and around the mouth, genitals, or anus, and the disease is therefore passed on through any kind of sexual activity. \nSyphilis can be caught more than once, so even if you have had it and have been treated before, it’s important to be careful and use protection.\nSymptoms\nSyphilis symptoms aren’t always obvious, and some people have no symptoms at all. If you do have symptoms, these might disappear, but that does not mean that you are no longer infected. Unless you get treatment, syphilis will not go away.\nSymptoms of syphilis include ulcers in or around the genitals, anus or mouth, which are usually small and painless and may not be noticed at the time; followed by a rash on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet; flu-like illness; tiredness; headache or skin growths around the vulva or anus.\nIf syphilis is not treated, it can spread to other parts of your body, such as your brain. This can cause serious problems and be much harder to treat, so it is important to get tested and treated as soon as possible if you believe you have been exposed.\nTesting and Diagnosis\nThe best place to have a syphilis test is a sexual health clinic, but you can go to your GP first if you prefer. They may refer you to a sexual health clinic if they aren’t able to test you themselves.\nA syphilis test usually involves a physical examination, a blood test and a swab of any sores you might have. If you don’t have any physical symptoms, or think you might have been exposed quite recently, a repeat blood test may be recommended a few weeks later to check for an infection that was missed.\nResults can take up to two weeks to come back, but some may be available the same day.\nTreatment\nFor most people, a short course of antibiotics will cure syphilis. The way these antibiotics are given to you depends on how long you have had syphilis for. \nIf you have had syphilis for less than two years, you will be offered either a single injection of penicillin in your buttocks, or a 10-14 day course of antibiotics. If you have had syphilis for more than two years, you will be offered either an injection of penicillin into your buttocks every week for three weeks, or a month-long course of antibiotics.\nIf syphilis has progressed to the brain, you will usually be offered penicillin injections into the buttocks or veins every day for two weeks, or a month-long course of antibiotics.\nYou should not have sex or sexual contact with another person for at least two weeks after your treatment finishes – this is because the infection could still be present and you could pass it on. \nHow long until syphilis goes away?\nWith treatment, symptoms of syphilis should clear up within three to six weeks. It is vital that you complete your course of antibiotics, even if you begin to feel better sooner. If you don’t, the bacteria could still be present and symptoms could come back. You could also reduce the chances of the treatment working again for you and for others. \nHerpes\nThe Herpes simplex viruses (HS1 and HS2) are viral infections that are passed from person to person via direct contact with the anus, genitals or mouth. \nThe majority of herpes cases occur in heterosexual people aged 15-24 years.\nTransmission\nHerpes is passed on when a sore, either on the mouth, genitals or anus, comes into contact with another person’s mouth, genitals or anus. \nYou’ve probably heard that cold sores are herpes, and that giving oral sex when you have a cold sore can infect someone with genital herpes. This is true. The herpes virus from sores on the mouth, genitals or anus can be passed on to any of these parts of the body, so kissing someone with a cold sore, as well as engaging in oral sex with an infected person, can also infect you with virus. \nHerpes symptoms can flare up and die down, and while you are more likely to catch herpes from someone with sores, you can still get it if they have no current symptoms.\nSymptoms\nHerpes symptoms can take a long time to appear. Symptoms of herpes generally occur in the genital area or mouth. These are pain or itching; red bumps or blisters; ulcers and scabs. In the early days after infection, you may also experience flu-like symptoms. \nTesting and Diagnosis\nYou can only be tested for herpes if you have visible sores or blisters. A doctor or nurse will swab the fluid from one of your sores for testing. They will also ask you about your sexual history and other symptoms. You should go to a sexual health clinic for a herpes test, as they are more likely to have the kits and resources. You can go to your GP if you prefer, but they may refer you to a sexual health clinic. \nTreatment\nThere is no cure for oral or genital herpes. Treatments target the symptoms of the infection, and include medication to prevent blisters from worsening or cream to target the pain. \nOnce you are infected with herpes, you are infected for life. Symptoms, however, come and go, and usually get less severe with each flare up or outbreak. Some people may never have symptoms, and therefore never know they have the herpes virus. Most people who do have symptoms experience fewer flare ups as time goes by.\nThe NHS website has some useful information about dealing with outbreaks by yourself.\nHow long until herpes goes away?\nA herpes outbreak generally lasts one to two weeks, with the first time usually being the longest, and each subsequent outbreak usually getting shorter or less severe. If you have herpes, you will never be cured, but your symptoms should improve over time. \nIt is important to tell any potential sexual partner if you have herpes and avoid having sexual contact if you have visible sores.\n\nGenital warts\nGenital warts are often confused with herpes, but they’re actually caused by an entirely different virus called human papillomavirus (HPV). Ring a bell? You might have had a HPV vaccine at school to protect you against cervical cancer.  Two types of HPV cause genital warts, which is not linked to any type of cancer.\nThe HPV vaccine also helps protect against genital warts. There are over 100 types of HPV, and almost all of us will be infected with at least one at some point in our lives.\nTransmission\nHPV is easy to catch, and can be passed on through genital contact (not necessarily penetrative sex), oral sex or sharing sex toys. Not everyone who catches HPV will get genital warts, so you might not know you have HPV. This is why HPV can be unknowingly spread between partners.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of genital warts include painless lumps around the vagina, penis or anus; bleeding from the genitals or anus; itching around the vagina, penis or anus; and a difference in the way your pee flows, like if it begins to flow sideways, or in a different direction to usual.\nYou may not have any symptoms at all. If you have visible genital warts, they can come and go.\nTesting and Diagnosis\nYou should go to a sexual health clinic to get examined for genital warts. You can go to your GP, but they will usually refer you to a specialist clinic. \nThe doctor or nurse at the clinic will usually talk to you about your sexual history and symptoms, and will examine you for warts, either externally or inside the vagina, urethra or anus, depending on whether you have visible lumps or not. In some cases, your doctor or nurse may take a sample (biopsy) of a wart to test whether HPV is present or not. \nIf you have no visible warts, your doctor or nurse will not be able to tell you whether you have the HPV virus that causes genital warts or not. \nTreatment \nSimilar to warts on the hands, treatment for genital warts focuses on removing the warts themselves as opposed to clearing up the infection. A cream can be applied either at home or at a clinic, which should help to reduce or remove the warts. You can also have your warts removed with a laser, incision or freezing treatment. This can be painful.\nThe treatment you receive will depend on the appearance and location of your warts. Treatment can take a long time, and the warts may come back. For some people, the body will fight the virus over time and symptoms will lessen or disappear.\nHow long until genital warts go away?\nThere is no cure for genital warts. Treatments focus on removing individual warts or clusters of warts, as opposed to curing the virus itself. With treatment, warts could take between several weeks to several months to reduce or disappear.\n——\nWe’ve covered the most common STIs here, but there are others that you could come into contact with. For all diseases, prevention is always better than cure, so be sure to protect yourself by using condoms, having regular screening and testing in new relationships. Most STIs can be easily treated, so don’t be scared of having a test and finding you do have an STI.  It’s important to remember if you are diagnosed with an STI, your current and recent sexual partners should be tested and treated as well – sexual health clinics will help you to do this confidentially. The NHS has some brilliant resources but if you’re unsure about your next steps speak to your GP or contact your local sexual health clinic.\nMary Hargreaves is a writer and author with a passion for women’s reproductive health.

        "Title": "Can you smoke weed while on birth control?",
        "Content": "\nIf you think you’ll find this blog interesting, make sure to check out our newsletter for more:\n\nTLDR… what’s the lowdown?\n\nWe don’t currently know much about the effects of smoking weed whilst on birth control\nWhat we do know is that THC (found in marijuana) can raise blood pressure and increase heart rate for some people – it could also impact your mood and anxiety\nSmoking weed with tobacco can increase your risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease, and raises your blood pressure – three things the combined pill also does (although at a much less extent)\nCBD could however do the opposite, potentially lowering your blood pressure and heart rate – as always, much more research is needed!\n\nAs weed is legalised in different places around the world, the stigma attached to it is shifting. It’s no longer associated with teenage boys in grimy basements, or free-living hippies in camper vans (even if that’s what your parents still believe). \nDespite it still being an illegal substance in the UK and some places in the US, nowadays smoking weed is a choice that lots of people make; some choose to do it, some choose not to.\nIf you do choose to smoke pot, and you take the pill, you might be wondering whether there are any interactions between the two. It’s a sensible consideration; whenever you introduce two substances into your body you should do your research. Unfortunately, there isn’t much in the way of scientific evidence about the combined effects of cannabis and the contraceptive pill. \nHere we’ll look at what we know about smoking weed and hormonal birth control.\nWeed and birth control pills\nPhysical health risks\nIn terms of the effects of combining marijuana and the pill, we don’t know much. What we do know is that each comes with its own risks, and that some of these risks overlap.\nSome people choose to smoke weed with tobacco. Smoking tobacco increases your risk of cardiovascular (heart and circulation) disease, raises your blood pressure and increases your risk of stroke. The combined pill also puts you at a higher risk of these conditions, albeit to a much lesser extent. If you’re smoking your weed with tobacco, and are also on hormonal contraception, you could be putting yourself at a higher combined risk than you would with one or the other.\nTetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is a psychoactive compound found in marijuana. It’s responsible for lots of the effects that weed can have on your body, such as euphoria, tiredness and paranoia. If you smoke weed on its own, or take THC in some other way, there are still some associated risks. In some people, THC raises blood pressure and increases heart rate, which could increase your chances of developing cardiovascular disease. \nOne study also found that oestrogen can make you more susceptible to the effects of THC.  Using THC with forms of contraception that contain oestrogen such as the combined pill, patch or vaginal ring could also therefore increase your risk of cardiovascular disease.\nPsychological health risks\nFor some women, the pill may impact their mood and emotions. Use of marijuana, however frequently, has been associated with depression as well as panic anxiety. If hormonal contraception impacts your mood, this could be exacerbated by smoking weed. \nAs we said earlier, THC is psychoactive, meaning it’s responsible for the psychological effects weed gives you. We already know that the effects of THC are increased by oestrogen, so if you’re on combined hormonal contraception, the psychological effects you get from weed could be greater.\nWeed has been continually proven to be linked to psychosis in certain groups, particularly when a potent form is used. Combining weed and the pill could increase the risk of psychiatric disorders, particularly if you have a mental health condition, or are at risk of psychosis, for example if you have a close family member who has also suffered from the condition. \nWhat about CBD?\nCannabidiol (CBD) is another compound found in marijuana. Unlike THC, CBD is legal, and is rapidly gaining popularity in the UK. CBD can be bought as an oil, an inhaler, in food and even as a water infusion. While THC can raise blood pressure and heart rate, CBD may have the opposite effect. CBD is also not psychoactive, meaning it has no impact on your psychological state (basically, it won’t get you high). \nThere isn’t currently any evidence surrounding the effects of taking CBD with hormonal contraception. Some assume that, as it may work to improve cardiovascular health through effects on blood pressure and heart rate, CBD could reduce the cardiovascular risk associated with taking the pill. Much more research is needed in this area though.\nDoes weed affect birth control’s effectiveness?\nThere is no current evidence to suggest that weed has any direct impact on the effectiveness of hormonal contraception – so it doesn’t ‘cancel it out’ so to speak. However it’s important to consider that using weed may reduce your inhibitions and lead to increased risk taking. \nIf you’re using a method of contraception that needs to be remembered every time you have sex or every day for example, using weed or other substances could affect your desire to use or ability to remember effective contraception. \nStill have questions about weed and birth control?\nWhile science doesn’t yet have all the answers, we might be able to answer some of your more specific questions in more detail whether it be about smoking, contraception or your sexual health.\n To discuss what you’ve read here, or if you’d like to talk about anything else related to your contraception, book a consultation with one of our lovely expert doctors, who will tell you everything you need to know.\n\nMary Hargreaves is a writer and author with a passion for women’s reproductive health.

        "Title": "My journey with endo, contraceptives and hormonal symptom suppression",
        "Content": "\nThe relationship between my Endometriosis and the Pill / hormones has been incredibly turbulent. For background, I have had painful, debilitating periods since they started aged 11, and developed an array of other issues after I finished my A levels, such as painful sex. I was finally diagnosed with stage 1 Endometriosis when I was 19 via laparoscopy. Since surgery, my symptoms have been better, but very unpredictable and still painful. For backstory, I have been on (the now discontinued) Loestrin 30, Provera 30mg (not classed as a contraceptive), Cerazette (mini pill), and Millinette 30/75 (combined pill). \nThe positives\nSo, I’ll start with the positives; hormones have been beneficial in controlling my Endometriosis symptoms. I was put on Provera 10mg 3 times a day prior to my op (which worked in symptom control). Every hormonal contraceptive I’ve tried since then has also helped – less painful and lighter periods, no pain during sex, no ovulation pain. I also want to add that when I come off hormones, my symptoms are usually on their best behaviour for a while – although I know this isn’t the case for all people with Endo. Hormones do tend to be beneficial in “shutting down” a flare up for me, even after stopping.  \nThe negatives\nHOWEVER, for me the negatives of hormones and hormonal contraception, so far, has massively outweighed the positives. I unfortunately do not tolerate progesterone well, and my main side effect on any hormonal contraceptive I’ve tried so far has been low moods, and generally feeling very emotionally detached. For me, these mood problems have been so bad that I would rather deal with the physical pain of living with Endometriosis, rather than the mental and emotional issues hormones so far have caused me. \nThat being said, I haven’t written off ever trying hormonal contraceptives again to suppress symptoms. This is due to my experience with Dr Fran and how attentive and communicative she has been when I reached out for advice. During our consultation she really listened to my concerns regarding mood (because honestly that is my biggest concern, even over my Endometriosis symptoms, no matter how bad my flare up!). Because of my bad experience with consultants not taking my concerns seriously (which I’m sure is relatable to a LOT of us with Endo and other “women’s” issues!), I didn’t choose the pill Dr Fran recommended (Yasmin) – instead I chose Millinette 30/75 due to my own research. Unfortunately this pill didn’t agree with me either, but did help my Endo. However, this pill was absolutely 100% better than my experience on the mini pill. This solidified to me that I am going in the right direction with the pills I have trialled (and errored) on. I wish I just chose Yasmin, it might have saved me a lot of emotional bother! \n\nMy advice to you\nMy advice to those struggling with Endometriosis and hormones/hormonal contraceptives is:\n\n To talk to The Lowdown (genuinely, Dr Fran helped lower my guard that I’ve built up around doctors), or at least find a doctor you trust who treats you holistically and not as a medical condition. \n Don’t make any decision regarding hormonal suppression in a hurry if you aren’t comfortable. I did due to a very flary few months, and panic at finding out that my pain was due to newly found adhesions a year and a half after my op. This definitely clouded my judgment regarding my contraceptive choice, and also made mood problems worse due to anxiety over not being ready to go back on hormones.\n Use tools such as the pill ladder (google it!) and The Lowdown’s pill switcher tool to find out if your side effects are due to progesterone or estrogen.\n If hormones just don’t cooperate with you, don’t worry. I think a lot of us use hormones to hide our condition and make ourselves “easier” to deal with at the doctors, and for employers, family, etc (or at least that’s part of why I have used them). Do what works for YOU. For now, I’m sticking with codeine when I need it – I would much rather feel “drugged” on the days my pain warrants taking it, over feeling depressed for months. \n Don’t go from one method to another if you’re finding it overwhelming, or finding the side effects too much. I found that coming off Millinette gave me a chance to see if my flare had calmed (which it had!), and give me more perspective over what I’m willing to tolerate and what I’m not. \n\nThis blog is a part of The Lowdown’s My Contraceptive Journey series.

        "Title": "I’ve had a baby &#8211; I need a break before the next! Contraception after birth",
        "Content": "\nPicture the scenario – your beautiful bundle of joy has arrived; sleepless nights, leaking breasts and a constant battle with the pile of washing. I’m living through this, and what I would NOT want is to fall pregnant and start with morning sickness again….hence contraception!\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) currently advises leaving 18-24 months between pregnancies, and a large study from Canada suggests that 12-18 months before your next pregnancy is the ideal gap to reduce risks to the baby, including premature birth and a low birth weight. While you might not be rushing to jump between the sheets within those first few whirlwind weeks, you may be getting the urge of intimacy before these 12 months are up, and contraception is so important to help space out pregnancies.\nIt’s not uncommon for a woman to find herself pregnant a couple of months after giving birth, sometimes accidentally. This is often because people don’t realise they are fertile BEFORE their periods return. Remember a period is what happens if an egg isn’t fertilised, therefore you must ovulate (which can lead to a pregnancy) before your period comes back. \nSo, given this information, it’s a good idea to have a think about contraception before you actually have the baby. Even if you don’t, your healthcare professional should be discussing contraception with you either before you leave hospital or at your 6 week check after birth. UK guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) states this should be done by hospital staff or your GP, but of course the local sexual health service can help too.\nWhat contraception is best after giving birth?\nThe answer to this is both simple and complicated. The best contraception after giving birth is whatever is the best for you based on your needs, preference and medical history. At The Lowdown, we strongly believe contraceptive choice should be individualised, and it’s our mission to give you all the info needed to make the best choice for you. You can discover which contraception is best for you by taking our contraception quiz.  \n\nWhen do I need to start contraception after a baby?\nWe know you can’t get pregnant for 21 days after delivery. Some women may not ovulate for several months after delivery depending on other factors like breastfeeding. We can’t predict when each woman will start ovulating again so it’s best to think about contraception early.\nWhat can I start straight away?\nEven though you don’t need contraception for the first 21 days, some contraception can be started immediately after birth. This is ideal as you don’t have to think about it later when the tiredness really kicks in. These options include:\n\nprogestogen-only pill (mini pill)\ninjection\nimplant\nhormonal coil\ncopper coil\n\nThe Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH) suggests that maternity services should always have someone available who can offer you a contraceptive injection, implant or coil immediately after birth. However, unfortunately, in reality this might not always be possible due to staffing and the timing of your delivery. If that’s the case, you should be directed to where you can get your chosen contraceptive and provided with an alternative in the meantime.\nWhen can I start the combined pill after a baby?\nCombined hormonal contraception (the pill, ring or patch) can be safely started 6 weeks after giving birth for women who are medically eligible whether you are breastfeeding or not. If you AREN’T breastfeeding, you may be able to start combined contraception after 3 weeks as long as you have no other risk factors for blood clots like smoking, a raised BMI or have had a c-section. The reason for the longer delay before you can start combined contraception is all about blood clot risk. We talk a lot about blood clots with combined contraception, you can read more about it here.\nWe know that during pregnancy and the 6 week period just after giving birth, you have a higher risk of blood clots, which is greater than taking any type or brand of combined contraception. But the chance of you having a blood clot can add up with each separate risk factor, and therefore during this time the risks of taking combined contraception will outweigh the benefits.\n\nDoes anything change with barrier methods?\nBoth male and female condoms can be used straight after delivery, just like they were beforehand. If you use a diaphragm, you will need to wait for 6 weeks after delivery for the uterus to shrink back down and as your size may have changed, have another fitting. It’s advisable to use another method in the meantime.\nCan I use fertility awareness methods soon after pregnancy?\nFertility awareness methods are most effective if you’ve been taught by a trained practitioner and are using multiple methods to identify your fertile days (cycle tracking, temperature and cervical mucus). For the first 4 weeks after delivery, these fertility signs aren’t present so the method won’t be reliable. The FSRH advice states that fertility awareness can be used 4 weeks after delivery if you ARE NOT breastfeeding, but that while breastfeeding you may want to consider another option.\nIf I want, can I be sterilised during a c-section?\nYes, if you discuss this with your obstetrician beforehand, female sterilisation can be offered at the same time as a planned c-section. Guidelines say you should discuss and consent to this at least 2 weeks before your c-section.\nCan the coil be put in straight away? Are there any risks?\nBoth the copper and hormonal coil can be inserted within the first 48 hours after delivery, including straight after the placenta has been delivered, or during a c-section. However, not all maternity services can provide this, so we suggest discussing this option during your antenatal care. If you miss this 48 hour window or develop an infection after delivery, the insertion should be delayed until 4 weeks after and after any infection has been treated. Advantages of an early insertion after a vaginal delivery include significantly less pain on insertion (bonus), however, you have to weigh this up against the disadvantage that the coil has a higher risk of falling out (expulsion). Insertion of coils during a c-section does not increase your risk of expulsion, and you’ll be numb so no pain! Some research shows that the risk of perforation (where the coil can move through the uterus wall) is lower if inserted early after delivery as your muscle wall will still be thick.\n\nCan breastfeeding be used as a contraceptive?\nWell yes it can! This is called the Lactational Amenorrhoea Method (LAM). However, this is only considered a reliable form of contraception in certain strict conditions. You can only rely on this method if:\n\nThe baby is less than 6 months old\nThe mother is exclusively (or almost exclusively) breastfeeding day and night, and\nHer periods have not returned\n\nIf all these conditions are met, the LAM method is considered to be 98% effective, similar to contraceptive methods like the pill. However there are lots of factors that might affect these criteria, such as a reduction in the amount the baby is breastfeeding, if you are expressing milk or introducing other foods. Fertility UK is a useful resource if you want to learn more about this. \nWill my side effects on a certain contraception change after I’ve had a baby?\nUnfortunately, as with much of women’s health (don’t get us started), this hasn’t been researched extensively. There has been some patchy research on the bleeding patterns with the implant and injection after pregnancy. This has found no difference in irregular or frequent bleeding compared to what we’d usually expect with these methods. The timing of starting the implant or injection after delivery also makes no difference to change in bleeding pattern. Annoyingly, there is no research on more complex side effects such as mood change. However, at The Lowdown, we have heard stories of women who have been really settled on a method of contraception before they got pregnant. On returning to the same method after pregnancy, they found their side effects were completely different! We believe this is only a small minority of women, but we would LOVE to find out more, so if this relates to you, please leave us a review to help other women.\nDon’t forget, if you have any other questions that we haven’t covered, use our Get Advice service or drop us a message!\n\nOne of The Lowdown’s fab Clinical Directors, Dr Frances Yarlett MBBCh (Hons) BSc (Hons) MRCP (2016) MRCGP DFSRH completed her medical training from Cardiff University in 2013.

        "Title": "How do I check my coil threads?",
        "Content": "\n\n\n\nCoils are becoming ever more popular, and we love them at The Lowdown. Despite an inconvenient fitting procedure, the IUS and IUD are the most highly rated contraception methods by our users, so we expect even more of you to be taking the plunge in the future.\n\nWhy should I check my coil threads?\nCoils (including the Mirena, copper and other IUS/IUD brands) are fab for many reasons, including because they can stay in place for anywhere between 3-10 years. Over this time, you are advised to check in with your coil every so often to make sure there are no problems. Part of this is monitoring for any new symptoms, the other is checking the coil threads. This is important to recognise if your coil has fallen out (expulsion) or moved.\nExpulsion can happen in up to 1 in 20 women, most commonly within the first 3 months after fitting, or sometimes up to a year. The coil can also move up or down, lessening it’s contraceptive effect, and even perforate (make a hole) through the wall of the uterus. This is rare, but can happen in about 1 in 1000 coil fittings.\nFeeling your coil threads is therefore a really important way to check in with your coil and get to know your body. It really isn’t that bad and only similar to inserting a tampon or menstrual cup. Here is our ‘how to guide’.\nWhen should I check?\nAfter you’ve had the coil fitted (and we hope you’ve had a comfortable experience!) you should check the threads 4 weeks after. Doctors used to get everybody to return for an examination 4-6 weeks after a fitting, but now we recommend self checks because it’s easy, you don’t have to miss work and, well, COVID happened.\nThe most common time for a coil to come out is within the first 3 months after fitting and after a period. So we advise you to check the threads every 4 weeks which correlates to after a period. Some practitioners relax the 4 week rule after the first 3 months but will still recommend self checks at regular intervals while the coil remains in place.\nHow to check coil threads\nTo feel for coil threads, get into a comfortable position similar to how you would insert a tampon or menstrual cup.\nUse your 2nd or 3rd finger and pop it inside your vagina. You’re trying to feel your cervix which is smooth and firm, and feels just like the tip of your nose. From the cervix you should feel 2 thin threads coming down into the vagina. You may not be able to easily identify 2 separate threads and that’s fine. These soften over time and might feel a bit like dental floss.\nWhat if they are longer or shorter?\nOfficial guidance doesn’t mention whether longer or shorter strings warrants a trip to the doctors but many practitioners advise to look out for this. In our experience, threads can change slightly from month to month as the womb and cervix are mobile within the pelvis. We also know that coil threads can easily wind up within the cervical canal itself which can explain shortening of threads. However, if there is a drastic change in the length of your threads OR any other symptoms, you might want to get the coil position checked out.\nWhat other symptoms should I be looking for?\nYou should NOT be able to feel the plastic part of the coil which would feel like a matchstick coming down into your cervix. Neither should your partner during sex. If you can, this could be a “partial expulsion” where the coil has come down from the womb into the cervical canal. \nIn SOME women, this will still act as contraception but small research studies have shown it may not be not as effective if the coil has moved 2cm or more away from the top of the uterus.\nOther signs of a coil that has moved or come out include:\n\nPelvic and lower tummy pain\nA sudden change in your bleeding eg. you have had no periods for 3 years then suddenly start bleeding\nA change in your vaginal discharge to a strange colour or smell (this is a sign of infection which needs identifying and treating quickly)\n\n \nWhat do I do if I can’t feel my threads?\nIf you can’t feel your threads or have any of the symptoms above, you should call your GP or local sexual health service. Before you are seen for an examination, discuss with your doctor if you might need emergency contraception and use another form of contraception until you are seen.\nWhen you are examined, the doctor will perform a speculum examination (like during a smear test) to look for your threads and check for any other problems. If the threads can’t be seen, the next step is to arrange an ultrasound and provide you with different contraception to keep you protected from pregnancy. If the ultrasound shows the coil isn’t in the right position, your healthcare practitioner will discuss the next steps for removal or replacement of the coil. If the coil is in the correct position you can continue to use it for contraception. \nSometimes the threads can reappear, if not it is possible to use a device to pull the threads back down into place so the coil can be removed when needed. \nIf you’ve experienced any of the above, don’t forget to leave us a review to share with other users!\n\n\nOne of The Lowdown’s fab Clinical Directors, Dr Frances Yarlett MBBCh (Hons) BSc (Hons) MRCP (2016) MRCGP DFSRH completed her medical training from Cardiff University in 2013.

        "Title": "How contraception can help with heavy and painful periods",
        "Content": "\nOn average, a woman will have 500 periods in her lifetime. If you take a ‘typical’ 28-day cycle and count seven of those days as bleeding days, that equates to just under ten years of bleeding. Ten years. That’s a lot! And if you’re experiencing heavy and painful periods, ten years is a long time to just suffer through it. \nFortunately, contraceptives have a use outside of their ability to prevent pregnancy and can help put an end to the dread of monthly disruption and miserable pain. \nWhat are heavy periods?\nThe average amount of blood lost during a woman’s period is around 30-40ml, the equivalent of 6-8 teaspoons. Heavy bleeding, also known medically as menorrhagia, is defined by the NHS as ‘80ml or more in each period, having periods that last longer than seven days, or both’.\nThere are indicators to assess the amount of blood loss you’re experiencing, and thankfully, using a teaspoon doesn’t have to be one of them! Changing sanitary pads every 1-2 hours, passing blood clots larger than 2.5cm, and bleeding through your clothes can all point to menorrhagia.\nWhat causes heavy periods?\nFor many women, heavy periods have no obvious cause. But for some, an underlying issue can be at play. Fibroids and endometriosis can both cause heavy periods, as well as other conditions such as pelvic inflammatory disease. The presence of an IUD (copper coil) has also been shown to cause heavier periods.\nDue to the potential for a range of causes, it’s important to seek medical advice if you are experiencing heavy periods or you notice any changes to your normal cycle. Heavy periods can result in iron deficiency anaemia, and your GP can check for this with a simple blood test. As with most things period-related, one person’s ‘normal’ is another person’s ‘irregular’, so knowing what’s normal for you is always important.\nHow to stop heavy periods\nDepending on the cause of your heavy periods, hormonal and non-hormonal treatment options are available. Non-hormonal treatments include tranexamic acid and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) ibuprofen or mefenamic acid.\nHormonal contraceptives – the combined pill, the patch, the vaginal ring, the progestogen-only (or mini) pill, and the intrauterine system (IUS) –  can be effective in the management of heavy and painful periods. More on this later.\nFor some, surgical treatments may need to be considered. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH) may be used either prior to surgery or as an alternative. They work to induce a medical menopause and studies have proven GnRH to be extremely effective. They do, however, come with very significant side effects, and should therefore warrant careful consideration.\n\nWhat causes period pain?\nPeriod pain, or dysmenorrhoea, is caused by contractions of the uterus designed to help shed the uterine lining. The blood vessels are compressed so tightly, the oxygen supply to the uterus is temporarily cut off. This lack of oxygen to the tissue results in the release of pain-triggering chemicals. The body also produces chemicals called prostaglandins, which cause the uterus to contract more, adding to the pain.\nIn some cases, period pain may be the result of an underlying condition, such as endometriosis or fibroids. An IUD may cause pain, more noticeably in the first few months following insertion. If you notice any changes in pain, or you get additional symptoms including pain during sex or bleeding in-between periods, contact your doctor.\nWhen is a period not a period?\nWhen the pill was developed over 50 years ago, researchers believed the idea would be more palatable if women still experienced a monthly bleed. In an effort to appease the Pope, the guidance replicated the natural 28-day cycle and resulted in the 7-day break every twenty-one days. But the bleed that comes along during that pill-free break is not actually a period; it’s a withdrawal bleed.\nWhilst on the combined pill, the endometrium (the lining of the womb) only grows a small amount, meaning the need for a monthly bleed is not necessary. It is perfectly safe to take the pill continuously, and advice has recently been updated to support this. Check out our complete guide on ‘Taking the pill continuously.\nWhen the pill is taken in this way, the hormones in the pill bind to receptors in the endometrium and prevent you from bleeding. Over time though you may experience breakthrough bleeding. This may present as spotting or as a heavier, more period-like bleed and can indicate the need for a break, for a maximum of seven days. You can then return to taking the pill continuously, missing the withdrawal bleed breaks.\nStudies show breakthrough bleeding is more likely to occur with continuous use – as opposed to cyclical use with a 7-day break. But over time, the frequency and intensity of this breakthrough bleeding decreases.\nHow does the mini-pill affect periods?\nThe progestogen in the mini-pill binds to receptors in the endometrium, much the same way as it does with the combined pill. The big difference, however, is you are much less in control of your breakthrough bleeding. You need to take the mini-pill every day, with no breaks to prevent pregnancy. A break in taking the mini-pill will result in a break in protection. Eek! Bleeding patterns can be very unpredictable in the first three months of using the progestogen-only pill, following this periods may be lighter, but may also be irregular or more frequent. Conversely, for some, they may stop altogether. \nA survey carried out by The Lowdown found 47% of women experienced a stop to their periods whilst taking the progestogen-only pill, compared to only 7% of women on the combined pill. One user of The Lowdown wrote:\n“I have been taking this pill for 5 years every day. When I first started this pill, I had a light period consecutively for the first 3 months, but I haven’t had a period, pains, or cramps since. Sometimes I get the odd spotting.”\nThe pill as a treatment for heavy periods\nEvidence consistently shows that the use of combined hormonal contraceptives results in lighter periods. The combined pill, the contraceptive patch, and the vaginal ring can all be used to help manage heavy periods and period pain. \nThere is less evidence to suggest their efficacy in the management of period pain, but it may be beneficial to use combined hormonal contraceptives continuously, avoiding withdrawal bleeds, with studies showing an advantage over the more traditional cyclical use (with breaks) in the short term.\nThe coil and heavy periods\nThe most effective treatment for heavy periods is the hormonal coil (IUS), commonly known as the Mirena coil. \nThe IUS releases progestogen into the uterus, thinning the lining of the womb and keeping it thin whilst in place. Periods tend to become lighter, less frequent, and for some, may stop altogether. The benefits increase over time as the blood loss is reduced gradually, reaching a 97% reduction after 12 months of use. The majority of women also report the Mirena coil to be an effective treatment for period pains.\nThe copper IUD, however, may make periods heavier, longer, and potentially more painful. And for this reason, the copper coil is best avoided for those already experiencing heavy and/or painful periods.\nHow the copper coil works is still a little bit of a mystery, but the copper released into the uterus is thought to cause mild inflammation. The effect of the copper is that the cervical mucus is altered, making it harder for the sperm to reach the egg, the egg and sperm cannot meet, and the implantation of a fertilised egg – in the unlikely event this should happen –  would also be inhibited.\nCan the implant and injection help with heavy periods?\nThe contraceptive implant and the contraceptive injection both work by releasing progestogen into the bloodstream. They can help reduce painful, heavy periods, but irregular bleeding is a possible side-effect. \n66% of The Lowdown users currently using the injection experienced a stop to their periods, whilst 13% found them to be irregular. Nearly half of those using the implant had irregular periods compared to a third whose periods stopped entirely.\nThere are so many options available if you’re struggling with painful and heavy periods, and thankfully, suffering in silence doesn’t have to be one of them.

And why not add your own review to the mix, to help others on their contraceptive journeys?

        "Title": "Hirsutism: how contraception can help with excess hair growth",
        "Content": "\nWatching any razor or hair removal advert would have you believe that we should exist with Barbie doll smooth skin, where any hint of stubble calls for imminent removal faster than you can shout ‘Brazilian Wax.’ \nWe still remember the PE room chatter, feeling mortified at a frighteningly young age about leg hair, or god forbid some armpit fuzz. Growing up against this backdrop, it’s hard to see what is normal and what isn’t…\nIn this piece we explore hirsutism and the various treatment options, including the combined pill.\n If you think you’ll find this blog useful, make sure you don’t miss out on anymore by subscribing to our newsletter:\n\nHirsutism: what is it?\nAffecting around 5-10% of women, hirsutism is where coarse terminal hairs appear in a male-type distribution (like the face, back or stomach). Terminal hairs include pubic hairs and eyebrows (different to the softer, shorter vellus hairs that appear over the body).\nHypertrichosis (generalised hair increase) has other causes and isn’t discussed within this piece. \nThere are ways to diagnose hirsutism. After observing whether the hair growth is in male pattern areas, tests are: \n\nFerriman-Gallwey scoring system: this looks at 9 key androgen sensitive areas which are each scored from 0 to 4 (excessive hair growth). A total score of 8 or more is used to determine hirsutism in black or white women of reproductive age. This score can be lower for some Asian and South American populations and higher for some Mediterrean, Middle Eastern or Hispanic populations. \nElevated Androgens: If associated with PCOS, a blood sample showing elevated androgens (e.g. testosterone) could be a marker of diagnosis. However, diagnosis of PCOS requires further tests including a pelvic ultrasound to detect ovarian cysts and investigation into menstrual irregularities.  \n\n\nWhat causes hirsutism?\nPolycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)\nHirsutism is most commonly associated with PCOS (there’ll be more on this later). Studies suggest 72-82% of all hirsutism cases are due to PCOS.\nIn PCOS, some women may have small cyst-like follicles on their ovaries. These immature follicles often fail to ovulate and can be caused by hormonal imbalances such as excess androgens e.g. testosterone. To find out more about PCOS, we have a brilliant talk by PCOS expert Professor Colin Duncan on our website. Watch the recording here and check out this brilliant blog on contraception and PCOS.\nIdiopathic Hirsutism (IH)\nSometimes hormone levels and ovarian function (e.g. ovulation and menstrual cycles) can be completely normal, this is known as Idiopathic Hirsutism with no other underlying cause identified. Less than 20% of cases of hirsutism are down to IH, but interestingly one half of women with mild hirsutism have IH (scores 8-15). \nOther causes: \n\nAndrogen secreting tumour: produces hormones such as testosterone\nAdrenal Hyperplasia: enlarged adrenal glands\nCushing’s syndrome: an excess of the hormone cortisol\nThyroid dysfunction: underactive thyroid gland\nCertain medications: including sodium valproate and anabolic steroids\n\nOkay, some of the above sound pretty sinister but just to reassure you that these are much less common – most likely causes are PCOS or IH. \nSome people may also experience hirsutism due to hormonal changes around the menopause. After the menopause, oestrogen levels fall to undetectable levels. The small amount of testosterone in the female body may therefore predispose some people to androgenic symptoms, especially acne, increased facial hair growth and male pattern baldness. \n\nWhat’s the deal: PCOS and body/facial hair growth\nSo, to understand this connection we need to think about normal hair growth. Our bodies are covered with hair follicles, containing vellus or terminal hairs. In women, vellus areas are the fine, soft hairs on your face or back. You might not be able to see them unless you look closely. Terminal hairs are darker and thicker (typically covering the face and body in men), but in women cover the scalp, pubic areas and armpits. \nAndrogens (produced by the ovaries) can be elevated in women with PCOS causing excessive hair growth. This makes sense as men have a higher level of androgens and much more terminal hair spread throughout their bodies. \nYour hair follicles may be sensitive to increased androgens which can be present with PCOS – this can cause the softer vellus hairs to change to thicker, faster growing terminal hairs. Usually, once a vellus hair has changed to a terminal hair it will not change back again. \nThe pill and hair growth\nNormal hair growth occurs in cycles, whilst some follicles grow, others rest or shed. When taking the contraceptive pill, the hormonal changes can synchronise these cycles. This can make it look like your hair is growing or shedding more than normal. Don’t worry though, these patterns seem to regulate after 6-12 months.  In fact, the pill is a popular treatment for hirsutism. \nRemember to log a review if you see any changes to body or facial hair growth whilst on different forms of hormonal contraception! We also have a fab blog specifically on how the pill can affect hair. \nDoes PCOS hair disappear?\nGiven the link to excess androgens, the more that can be done (including lifestyle changes), to normalise testosterone levels, the more likely improvement is. Medications such as the combined pill or topical creams can be super effective in managing excess hair. \nIf overweight, losing weight can help as the hormonal imbalance in PCOS improves. \nDoes chin hair mean PCOS? \nPlucking the odd straggly chin hair is normal and nothing to worry about – particularly if it’s finer hair. However, if you notice that there are repeated, thick, dark hairs, this could be due to the hormone imbalances seen in PCOS. However, diagnosing PCOS requires other tests and hallmarks. Remember some hair growth can be unexplained (evidence suggests it is genetic), so chin hairs alone are not enough to determine PCOS. \nNatural treatments for excess hair\nIt is perfectly fine to use regular hair removal methods such as shaving and bleaching to manage excess hair. Waxing is not recommended as it can cause skin damage and ingrown hairs. However, a few longer-lasting non-medical solutions are:\n\nLaser hair removal: this inhibits hair follicle growth. Most effective with dark hair and fair skin – but repeated sessions are needed. Also, it can induce terminal hairs to minimise into vellus hairs, so any hair within that site should appear thinner and lighter. Plus, it’s less painful than electrolysis!\nElectrolysis: Disrupts hair growth using heat or chemical energy. Usually more effective than laser hair removal but can cause scarring.\n\nMedical treatments for excess hair: \n\nThe combined pill: Progestogen inhibits the ovarian production of androgens and oestrogen inhibits Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG), a hormone that controls testosterone production, to prevent excess hair growth.\nEflornithine: This prescription cream can be applied to the skin twice a day and works best on facial hair growth.\nAnti-androgen medications:\n\nSpironolactone: This blocks androgen receptors and can be used alongside the combined pill.\nFinasteride: This drug influences enzymes that affect testosterone. However, it cannot be used for women who may want to get pregnant.\n\n\n\n\nEmma is a Pharmacology & Physiology graduate with a huge passion for women’s health.

        "Title": "Ovulation pain: what&#8217;s normal and what&#8217;s not",
        "Content": "\nYou’d think that cramps once a month would be enough, so it can come as a surprise when we’re keeled over two weeks after our period with no clue as to what could be causing the pain!\nFor some women, ovulation pain is short-lived or unnoticeable, but for others, it may be a longer-lasting discomfort that is more severe in nature. Ovulation pain is completely normal. But there may be situations where it is more acute and should be assessed by a doctor. \nHere we give the lowdown on ovulation pain and how to recognise what is normal and what’s not. \n✅ If you think you’ll enjoy this blog, make sure to check out our newsletter for more:\n\nWhat is ovulation pain? \nOvulation pain, also known as mittelschmerz (German for middle pain) is when some women get a one-sided pain in the lower part of their abdomen when they ovulate. This pain will occur about 14 days before your period starts and is when an ovary releases an egg during the menstrual cycle. \nWhy do you get ovulation pain?\nNobody is quite certain about why women experience ovulation pain, but there is a theory that it is because of the egg breaking through the ovary wall. When this happens a small amount of fluid or sometimes blood is released, which in turn irritates nearby nerves causing a woman to experience pain. \nSo, is it normal?\nIt is completely normal to have ovulation pain and is one of the symptoms of a woman’s periods. Women can experience the pain differently with some having it last only a few minutes, whilst others may find it can last up to a couple of days. If you do experience pain that is very severe, then this is not normal, and we would advise you to make an appointment with your doctor or talk to one of our own doctors at The Lowdown. \nHow many days after your period do you ovulate?\nYou will usually ovulate about 12 to 14 days before your next period starts. This is when a woman is at her most fertile. If you have regular cycles it may be possible to calculate how many days after your period starts you will likely ovulate.\nWhat does ovulation pain feel like?\nOvulation pain can often feel like a dull cramp, or some women may find it feels like a sharp and sudden twinge. For some people, this feels like period pains. A woman will typically feel ovulation pain in their lower abdomen and they may feel ovulation pain on the right side or ovulation pain on the left side depending on which ovary is releasing the egg. \n\nHow long do ovulation pains last?\nHow long the ovulation pains last depends on the person. For some women, it may be a pain that lasts a couple of minutes or shorter, whilst others may experience ovulation pain for up to two days. \nHow can I control ovulation pain?\nIf you are looking for ways to help reduce the pain from ovulation then we would recommend using a Myoovi. It works using transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), which helps with pain relief. By following the Myoovi link on our website you can grab a great discount on the product!\nOvulation pain and bleeding\nA woman may experience bleeding alongside ovulation pain. Don’t worry – this is totally normal! Check out our blog on ovulation bleeding and spotting to find out more\nIs bloating a sign of ovulation?\nA woman may experience bloating whilst they are ovulating as the change in hormones during this time can result in water retention. Bloating related to ovulation may last for around three days but also can last up to seven days after the egg is released. \nOvulation pain and the menopause\nMenopause is defined as when a woman stops having periods. It is due to a natural decline in oestrogen levels as you get older. Menopause normally occurs between the age of 45 and 55. During menopause, your ovaries will stop producing as much oestrogen and will no longer release an egg each month. You will therefore no longer be able to get pregnant. If you are no longer releasing an egg each month you will not experience ovulation pain. \nOvulation pain and fertility \nOvulation pain happens when an egg is being released, which is normally about 14 days before a woman’s period starts. This is when a woman is most likely to get pregnant, so therefore ovulation pain can be an indication of when a woman is in her fertile window.\n\nAre you fertile when you feel ovulation pain? \nAs ovulation pain occurs when your ovaries release an egg, it is considered to be a time when you are your most fertile. \nIs it too late to conceive after ovulation pain?\nThere is a window of about 12 – 24 hours after ovulation when a woman is able to get pregnant, but after this, the egg will have left the fallopian tube and a woman will not be able to get pregnant in that menstrual cycle. \nHow long are you fertile after ovulation pain?\nFollowing ovulation, the released egg hangs around for up to 12-24 hours. This is because once the egg has been released – which is what we think causes ovulation pain – the egg will only stay in the fallopian tube for a short time. Once the egg has left the fallopian tube then a woman will not be able to get pregnant in that menstrual cycle. \nOvulation pain with endometriosis\nEndometriosis is an inflammatory condition where tissue that is similar to the lining of the womb starts to grow in other areas such as the ovaries or fallopian tubes. Symptoms of endometriosis include pelvic pain, pain during or after sex, or severe period pains. If a woman has endometriosis she may find that ovulation pain is more severe. The Myoovi is recommended again for people who experience ovulation with endometriosis. \nIf you need any more information about Endometriosis, you can click here. Alternatively, if you’d like to know more about contraception options available, click here.\n\nOvulation pain – when to see a doctor?\nWhilst ovulation pain is normal, there are some cases where ovulation pain may be considered more severe or come with other symptoms such as heavy bleeding. If your ovulation pain increases over time or gets to the point where it interferes with daily functioning then we recommend that you book an appointment with your doctor. It is recommended to keep a diary of when the pain is occurring during your menstrual cycle and whether the pain is temporary or long-lasting. \nIf you would like to simply book an appointment for an ultrasound or MRI to determine whether you may have endometriosis, by using scan.com you are able to easily book in somewhere local to you whilst also skipping the NHS waitlist.\nHow will a doctor diagnose ovulation pain (mittelschmerz)?\nTo help in diagnosing ovulation pain, a doctor will ask for a detailed account of your medical history, with a focus on your menstrual cycle. They may also perform a pelvic exam to check for any underlying conditions that could be causing the discomfort instead of ovulation pain. \nWe hope you’ve found this a useful guide to ovulation pain, with some idea of what’s normal and when to seek medical advice! And as always if you’re not sure, speak to your GP. \nHatty is a freelance digital marketing consultant with over 10 years experience. You can view Hatty’s personal portfolio here.",

        "Title": "I&#8217;m pregnant! Now what? What to do when your contraception fails",
        "Content": "\n\nModern contraception is really effective, some methods are over 99% effective, meaning less than one woman in 100 will get pregnant in a year of using that method. But the ONLY 100% effective method is abstinence so as long as sex exists, unintended pregnancy will too. \nLet’s face it, life sometimes throws unexpected things our way. So it’s not unusual to miss a pill, forget when your next injection is due or be under stress that affects your fertility tracking. This can often have no consequence, but even if you are using your contraception perfectly, there will be rare cases when unintended pregnancies occur.\nHere is an ‘everything you need to know’ guide to support you, or a friend who has experienced an unintended pregnancy.\nWhat to do when you find out you’re pregnant…\nFirstly, take a deep breath and know that you are not alone. Unintended pregnancy is common and around half of women are actually using contraception when they accidentally fall pregnant. It might be worth speaking to someone you trust and sharing your feelings, and remember, you are not to blame, your body is a fertile being trying to populate the planet.\nWhat are my options?\nI’m shocked and surprised but also pleased!\nThis might be unplanned but you are delighted! In that case, CONGRATULATIONS. Please start taking your pregnancy vitamins – folic acid and vitamin D and/or use ScreenMe to have a vaginal health swab test\nThese are our Amazon affiliate links for supplements our doctors recommend – we earn a small commission too ❤️\nThey can also be bought from any pharmacy (the separate vitamins are much cheaper than the expensive pregnancy ones and just as effective). \nHave a read about the dietary and exercise advice from the NHS here, and consider trying to stop smoking and drinking alcohol if this is relevant. If you know the date of your last period, use this to calculate how many weeks pregnant you are here. \nBook in with your community midwife via a phone call to your GP. Register quickly with a GP if you haven’t already got one – antenatal care is very important for your wellbeing and that of the growing pregnancy! You can also use scan.com if you want to skip the waiting lists for an ultrasound – it will only take a few minutes!\nI’m overwhelmed and don’t really know what I want….\nThis is completely understandable, and please don’t rush into any decisions. If you are thinking through your options, consider following the advice above and starting pregnancy vitamins until you have weighed up your options and decided if this is a pregnancy you want to continue with or not.\nMany people find it difficult to speak to their family, but there are plenty of places you can find support. We recommend using a counselling service that is non-judgemental, impartial and has no agenda other than to support your decision making. \nIf you live in the UK, our recommendations are:\n\nThe British Pregnancy Advisory Service\nMSI Reproductive Choices\nNational Unplanned Pregnancy Advisory Service\nReferral through your local NHS abortion service which can arrange counselling\n\nI don’t think becoming a parent right now is the best decision for me….\nIf you do not want or cannot have a child at this moment, you have options including termination of pregnancy (abortion) or adoption after delivery.\nAdoption\nThis is where you deliver the baby but legally give up the right to be their parent after birth. Pregnant people may choose this option if they have passed the legal date for an abortion or they do not want an abortion due to personal or religious reasons. Adoption is arranged with the help of social workers. For more information please see here.\nAbortion or Termination of Pregnancy\n1 in 3 women in the UK will have an abortion before the age of 45.\nAbortions are common with more than 200,000 performed in England and Wales alone in 2020. Women, trans men, and non-binary people from all backgrounds, religions, races, marital groups and age groups undergo abortions, for a mixture of reasons including having an uintended pregnancy or a problem with the pregnancy. \nIn fact, while the teenage abortion rates are going down, the number of women choosing abortion over the age of 35 is increasing. This could be due to the increased difficulties in accessing contraception services over the pandemic, socio-economic factors, or the wider access and introduction of telemedical abortions. So if you choose this, please remember, you are NOT alone.\nIn the UK, we have the legal right to choose what we do with our bodies and at The Lowdown, we fully support this. You only have to watch Season 2 Episode 5 of Call the Midwife to realise how important access to safe, funded abortion care is. Worldwide, every minute of every day, 67 women resort to unsafe or ‘backstreet’ abortions, leaving them at risk of septicaemia, organ damage, infertility, and in some cases death. We are incredibly lucky to live in a country where women can avoid these risks and we want to work hard to further remove stigma surrounding abortion. \nYou have the RIGHT to choose an abortion for a pregnancy if continuing will affect your mental or physical health, or that of existing children or the unborn child. \nHow do I arrange an abortion?\nThere are several options to book an abortion.\n\nCall your GP who can refer you to the local NHS abortion service \nVisit your local sexual health clinic who can also make this referral – check here for your nearest\nSelf refer to a private clinic or charity. 99% of women who do this will get the treatment paid for by the NHS, it doesn’t mean you have to foot the bill yourself. Private clinics and charities are government regulated, safe and confidential. They include:\n\nBritish Pregnancy Advisory Service\nMSI Reproductive Choices\nNational Unplanned Pregnancy Advisory Service\n\n\n\n \nHow long will it take to get an appointment?\nThis is a really common cause of anxiety for women. The guidance is that every person has an appointment to discuss their options within 1 week of referral and the abortion procedure within 2 weeks of referral (so 1 week later).\nWhat happens at an abortion appointment?\nTraditionally, appointments are always face to face in an NHS or private clinic. Here, you will be seen by a healthcare professional (usually a specialist nurse) who will spend time talking through your options and checking you are happy with your decision. You may be offered further counselling if you are still not sure, but this is NOT compulsory. A medical assessment will be carried out to check how many weeks pregnant you are. The assessment might involve:\n\nAn ultrasound scan to see how many weeks pregnant you are. This may need to be with a small probe inserted into your vagina if the pregnancy is very early. Ultrasounds are not needed for everyone and you do not have to see the scan if you do not want to\nA blood test to check your blood type\nSwabs to check for a sexually transmitted infection (STI).\n\nFollowing this, you and your healthcare professional will discuss the best option for your abortion procedure.\nMedical Abortion – What happens when you take the abortion pill?\n85% of women choose to have a medical abortion. A medical abortion is carried out using 2 tablets taken 24-48 hours apart.\n\nMifepristone is the first tablet which blocks the hormone progesterone. Progesterone is needed to keep the pregnancy growing, so the tablet stops the pregnancy’s growth.\nMisoprostol is the second tablet which opens the cervix (neck of the womb) and causes the womb to contract so the pregnancy is passed out of the vagina. If suitable, you can take this at home if you are less than 10 weeks pregnant, otherwise you will need to be in a clinic for this second stage. It’s a good idea to take some painkillers 10 minutes before the second tablet such as paracetamol and ibuprofen. We don’t recommend aspirin as this can make bleeding more heavy. The second tablet can be given inside the mouth to dissolve in the side of the cheeks or up inside the vagina. You might have fewer side effects if you use the vaginal method.\n\nYou should expect to start bleeding within 3 hours of taking the second tablet. If not, you may need more medication and this will be explained clearly before you start the treatment.\nYou’ll be advised to use sanitary towels only rather than tampons or a menstrual cup to reduce infection and track your bleeding.\nMost abortions are complete within 1-2 days and your bleeding should become lighter after the pregnancy has passed. However, sometimes the bleeding can go on for up to 2 weeks.\nWhat will the abortion look like?\nIf you are completing the abortion at home you might be worried about what to expect to come out. Usually, you will have large blood clots and what we call ‘pregnancy tissue’. This shouldn’t be larger than the size of a lemon. In most cases, you cannot see a recognisable foetus (very early baby) within this pregnancy tissue. \nAfterwards, you can either flush this down the toilet or wrap it in tissue and put it in a normal household bin inside a plastic bag. In the hospital, the pregnancy tissue will be collected and it is your choice whether you take this home, or leave at the hospital where it will usually be cremated.\nCan I have abortion pills at home?\nDuring the COVID pandemic, rules were quickly changed by the government to allow women to continue to get access to abortions. Telemedical appointments were introduced. These are where the initial medical assessment is completed through a telephone or video appointment instead of in person at a clinic. Then if you are less than 10 weeks pregnant and suitable for an at home abortion, the pills can be sent to an address chosen by you. You will still be checked up on by the clinic with another telephone appointment and support will still be available.\nThe new system has had brilliant feedback from women, who have found it easier to access an abortion. This is especially true if you live a long way from a clinic, have children to care for, or have reasons that mean you wouldn’t be safe to attend a clinic for an appointment.\nResearch studies have shown that it is SAFE to have an abortion at home. At home abortions can also be quicker, with waiting times reduced from 11 to 6 days in one research study. After the success of telemedical abortions through the pandemic, the devolved governments across the UK have allowed ‘at home abortions’ to continue, and The Lowdown fully supports this renewed commitment to expanding access to abortion care.\nSurgical Abortion\n15% of women choose a surgical abortion. The abortion is carried out by an experienced gynaecology doctor. Depending on how many weeks you are, you may be offered the procedure using local anaesthetic which could shorten how long you have to stay in the clinic. \nIf you are further on in the pregnancy (over 12 weeks), you will require medication before the procedure to help the neck of the womb open, and may be advised to have a general anaesthetic or stronger sedation. Either way, you can usually go home on the same day.\nWhat happens after a surgical abortion?\n\nIf you are breastfeeding, wait for 5 hours after taking the tablets before breastfeeding again as tiny amounts of the tablets might be found in the breast milk\nPregnancy sickness and nausea should stop within 1-2 days (very quickly!) but sore boobs may continue for up to 3 weeks\nIf you are over 10 weeks pregnant and your blood tests showed that your blood type is Rhesus D negative, you will require an injection to prevent rhesus disease\nIt’s advised to not have sex for 2 weeks after the procedure to avoid infection\nYou can go swimming as soon as the pregnancy has passed if you’d like\nYou should avoid alcohol for 24 hours after the abortion but drink plenty of water\nYour vagina will clean itself naturally using it’s own discharge, don’t use douches or intimate washes\nAfter 3 weeks, you should take a pregnancy test. If you do one too early, it might still be positive. If it’s positive after 3 weeks – call your clinic back.\n\nWhat to look out for after an abortion?\nThere are some rare risks associated with abortion, and you should be aware of the signs so you know when to get help.\n\nInfection (10%) can cause a fever, smelly vaginal discharge or ongoing pain and bleeding – ring your clinic for help if you experience any of these\nFailed abortion (<1%) is when the procedure hasn’t worked and you don’t pass the pregnancy – ring your clinic to discuss your next options\nHeavy bleeding that needs a blood transfusion (0.1%). If you are bleeding through a pad every 30 minutes, please ring your clinic for advice and help\nSurgical abortion also has a very small risk of damage to the cervix and womb (0.1%-0.4%).\n\nI’m under 16 will my parents find out?\nAccess to abortion services is completly confidential. Healthcare professionals will only share information about you if we have reason to be concerned that you, or anyone else is at risk of harm.\nIf you are under 16, understand all of the advice about abortion, its implications, and it is in your best interests to have treatment without your parents knowing, then we will not tell them. You will be asked if you would like to tell your parents, but if you don’t that is your choice.\nI have concerns about my safety if anyone finds out\nSadly, there is a higher risk of domestic violence against pregnant women and there are other circumstances where people may feel vulnerable requesting an abortion. If you are worried about your safety, please tell your healthcare provider. \nThe ‘at home abortion’ service allows you to access an abortion without needing to travel to a clinic, and the pills can be sent to a different address. During your telephone appointments, tell your healthcare provider you are worried about someone finding out and a safe word can be arranged to stop the telephone call if needed.\nContraception after an abortion\nYou are fertile almost immediately after an abortion, with 90% of women releasing an egg within 1 month of the procedure – so don’t forget to think about contraception going forward! This will be discussed at your appointment, and even if you are having an abortion at home, contraception can be delivered to your door.\nYou will be pleased to know that all forms of contraception can be started safely after an abortion. The progestogen-only pill, implant and injection can even be started when you have the first abortion pill (although having the injection can increase your risk of having a failed abortion). The combined pill, patch or ring can be started immediately after an abortion and even the copper or hormonal coil can be inserted after a pregnancy has passed (unless there is an infection). You don’t need to use any extra protection if contraception is started within 5 days of the abortion. If you have been using fertility awareness methods, be aware that they may not be as effective after an abortion while your cycle gets into a rhythm again, and your diaphgram size may have changed so it’s worth getting this checked again.\nNeed more advice after using a contraception method which has failed for you? Look at our website or use our Get Advice service for help finding something suitable.\nSo that’s a lot of information about what happens if your contraception fails but we hope you’ve found it useful.

        "Title": "Can you feel the IUS/IUD coil during sex?",
        "Content": "\n✅ If you think you’ll find this blog interesting, make sure to check out our newsletter for more:\n\nSo your partner claims they can feel your coil during sex. You may be tempted to freak out, and we understand. Our bodies are complex, finding reliable information on the internet can be confusing, and not every woman is comfortable getting deep with their provider during a face-to-face appointment. \nBut don’t panic! The Lowdown has got your back. We do all the dirty work (research, polls, etc.), and all you have to do is read on.\nRemind me how the coil/IUS/IUD works?\nA coil or IUD is a small, t-shaped piece of plastic device that is inserted into your uterus by a medical professional.\nThe hormonal coil/IUD (previously known as an IUS) gradually releases the hormone progestogen. This hormone prevents pregnancy by stopping the release of an egg every month, thickening the cervical fluid and making it more difficult for sperm to enter and fertilize an egg, along with keeping the lining of the uterus thin to prevent the implantation of a fertilised egg.\nThe copper coil (aka IUD) contains no hormones and, instead, has a copper wire wrapped around the plastic device. This prevents pregnancy by decreasing the motility of the sperm and stopping the sperm and egg from meeting.\nThe coils are popular choices of contraception. They are both low maintenance and over 99% effective in preventing pregnancy. After insertion, an IUD can remain in place for 3-10 years, depending on the type or brand. After this time it can simply be removed and replaced with a new one by a healthcare professional.\nFeeling the coil during sex\nYour partner will, most likely, not be affected by your coil during sex. If your partner does claim to feel something new during sex, they are most likely feeling the threads of your coil, not the device itself. For removal purposes, the coils have short strings that hang down 3-4 cm through the neck of the uterus (the cervix) into the vaginal canal.\nWhile it is entirely possible to feel these strings, it is more likely than not your partner won’t feel anything at all. A Lowdown poll of 744 users determined that 28% of partners have felt the coil during sex, while 72% of partners have not.\nThe threads are also usually made of thin, flexible plastic and it is extremely unlikely they will cause any pain or discomfort to your partner. A study in 2017 determined that only 3-9% of partners have experienced enough discomfort from the coil strings to cause them to discontinue sex. The threads may tickle or occasionally nudge the tip of a penis, especially soon after insertion. However, the threads tend to soften over time reducing this feeling.\nThese IUD threads are actually beneficial. Along with aiding in the removal process, they can be helpful in determining if the device is in place, and the medical professional who performed the insertion should teach you how to occasionally feel for these strings. While string checks are not necessary for safe and effective use of the coil, most prescribing information from the companies of these devices instructs providers to counsel women on checking their coil strings and to make an appointment with their doctor or nurse if the strings are continuously unable to be felt, and use condoms or another method in the meantime.\nVery occasionally the threads get lost. This is more commonly caused by the threads being pulled up inside into the cervix. They may notice this when you go to have the coil removed, and sometimes the threads can reappear naturally. Don’t hesitate to reach out to your care provider or make an appointment if you feel your threads are out of place or have disappeared.\nIf your partner feels a harder, more uncomfortable sensation like a matchstick against the tip of the penis, this may need checking out as it could represent movement of the coil.\nCan the coil fall out during sex?\nThis is another common concern about how an IUD may impact your sexual wellbeing. It is important to understand that your coil is placed inside your uterus, rather than at the top of your vagina, so it is very unlikely to fall out during sex.\nHowever, sometimes an IUD can fall out, be pushed out of the uterus, or move. This is termed expulsion and happens to 1 in 20 users but is most common in the first few weeks after getting the coil fitted or during a period. Sex is not necessarily a risk factor for the expulsion of your coil and is not something to worry about. Read more common questions about coil fittings in our blog here or check out our stories over on Instagram.\nYou may not know your coil has fallen out, which is why it is important to check your coil threads regularly. You should make an appointment with your provider if your coil strings feel longer, shorter, or if you or your partner feels the actual device. Remember to use condoms or avoid sex until then.\n\nHow else can the coil affect my sex life?\nChances are the coil will not physically affect sex with your partner. However,  contraception can have a different effect on every woman and may cause more changes in some women than others.\nAccording to some of our reviews on the IUS and IUD, both vaginal dryness and low libido may be a side effect, which may affect your comfort during sex or the desire to even have sex. However, these possible side effects were reported by only a small percentage of women who reviewed these contraception methods on our website. \nRead our users’ reviews of the IUS and the IUD.\nSo, what’s the moral of the story?\nDo not panic if your partner claims they can feel your coil during sex! There is nothing to be afraid of; lots of women report their partners being able to feel the strings to their coil initially and this tends to lessen over time. \nIf the strings are impacting sex with your partner, you can speak to your doctor or nurse, as sometimes these strings can be cut shorter. However, the chance your coil will physically affect your sex life with your partner is low, and the benefits of a highly effective, low-maintenance method may outweigh any cons. \nImportantly, if sex begins to hurt for you or for your partner, or you are worried your coil has become dislodged, avoid sex or use condoms and make an appointment with your doctor or nurse to make sure everything is a-okay.\n\nErin is an Associate Account Executive at BGB Group in New York City.

        "Content": "\nWhilst your GP should explore your medical history and help you choose a contraceptive option that is a best fit with your health, family medical history and lifestyle, it is always beneficial to understand what your options are. Our contraception pages and contraceptive articles give a detailed look at all types of contraceptives you can ask your GP for, whilst also giving further insights such as ‘what to expect at your coil fitting’ or ‘can your contraceptive affect your mood’.\nThroughout this article, we take a look at everything you need to know when discussing contraception with your GP. \nIf you are looking to explore your contraceptive options with a GP, then here at The Lowdown we offer a contraceptive consultation service with two of our in-house GPs. Our Dr. Fran and Dr. Mel have packets of experience in contraception and women’s health and can provide a virtual 20 minute appointment at a convenient time that suits you to discuss your contraceptive options.  \nAlternatively, you can take our contraception quiz to be recommended the best contraception for you specifically. You can also use the contraception comparison, to compare every method of contraception, in helping you choose which will be most effective for you. \n\nHow do I talk to my doctor about contraception?\nWhen talking to your GP about birth control it can be helpful to research your options prior to the appointment. Whilst your GP can talk you through each contraception type and will assess what is right for your lifestyle, your medical history and your personal preference, we’d recommend looking at each of our contraception pages such as the copper coil, hormonal coil or combined pill plus our contraception reviews to help inform you before you have your appointment. If you would prefer to speak to a female doctor for your consultation, then request this at the time of booking.   \nAt The Lowdown we offer a contraceptive consultation where you can book in time to discuss your contraception options. If you decide you want to try a contraceptive pill you can access this for free via the NHS or you can order your contraceptive pill directly through The Lowdown site.  \nWhat questions to ask your GP about contraception?\nWhilst your GP should run through all aspects of each contraceptive, you may find it helpful to come prepared with a list of questions to ask them. If you are interested in finding out more about a particular contraceptive before speaking with your GP, then read our contraceptive articles where we cover all the facts you need to know. Below are some questions you may want to ask your GP about each contraception option. \n\nHow effective is this method?\nHow long does it last? \nHow regularly does it need to be taken/changed?\nCan I use this method with my medical history or family history? \nWhat side effects might I experience? \nHow will it affect my periods?\nAre there any risks associated with this method?\nWill the contraception affect my weight/skin/moods?\nHow soon after starting will you be protected from pregnancy?\nAre there any types of medication that may make it less effective?\nHow soon after stopping the contraception could I get pregnant?\n\nCan a GP refuse to prescribe my normal contraception?\nYes, a GP can refuse to prescribe your normal contraception if they consider there to be risks involved.  You may have had changes in your lifestyle or health which will determine whether a particular contraceptive would now place you more at risk. In the 6 weeks after having a baby, the risk of having a blood clot in your legs or lungs is increased. As the combined pill may slightly increase your risk of blood clots, an alternative method should be considered during this time.  If you have taken up smoking since starting your contraception and you are over the age of 35, then combined hormonal contraception could be refused by your GP. \nDo you see a doctor or nurse about contraception?\nYou can see either a doctor or nurse about your contraception choices. Most GP practices will offer nurse clinics where you can discuss your contraception with a nurse and also if it is straightforward to get a renewal of your current contraceptive. The GP practice may however ask you to see a doctor.\nCan I get emergency contraception from my GP?\nYes, your GP or sexual health clinic can supply emergency contraception. If you require emergency contraception then it is important to contact your GP or sexual health clinic as soon as possible to get an appointment as you only have a small window in which to use it to prevent pregnancy. Levonelle, the emergency contraceptive pill should be taken within three days and ellaOne within five days of unprotected sex. Your GP practice may also offer an IUD (also known as the copper coil) which is the most effective way of preventing pregnancy. If not they can put you in contact with a local service providing emergency IUDs. The IUD can be fitted five days after unprotected sex. Our article on getting the coil fitted, explains everything you can expect. \nCan you get free contraception from your GP?\nYes, any contraception that is prescribed by your doctor will be free. In the case where you may not want to wait to see your GP, or to visit your pharmacy to pick up the prescription, then you can order directly through The Lowdown through our online contraception ordering service, where you can buy your combined pill, or progestogen-only pill (aka mini pill). One of our pharmacy clinicians will review your order and your medical history and the pill will be delivered directly to your door within a couple of days. \nCan a GP prescribe contraception to under 16s?\nYes, a GP can prescribe contraception to those under 16 if they feel that the patient is mature enough to make their own decisions and understand the implications of those decisions.  If you are under 16 and would like to explore your possibilities for contraception, then we recommend that you talk to your parents or an appropriate adult if you feel comfortable in doing so. As well as discussing contraception with your GP, there is the option of a sexual health clinic (use this handy sexual health clinic finder) or young people’s services.  \nWhere can I get contraception without seeing a doctor?\nUp until July 2021, you have traditionally only been able to buy the emergency contraceptive pill over the counter in the UK, but the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) announced that the desogestrel containing progestogen-only pills Lovima and Hana will also now be available to buy without a prescription over the counter from the pharmacy. For all other types of contraceptive pills in the UK, you will need a prescription.  \nWant to speak to an online doctor about your contraception?

        "Title": "How contraceptives can help with endometriosis",
        "Content": "\nBut many of us still don’t really understand what endometriosis is – and how to treat it. Our in-house GP and Medical Director, Dr Fran shares everything you need to know, including how contraception can help.\n If you think this blog will interest you, make sure to check out our newsletter for more:\n\nWhat is endometriosis?\nEndometriosis is a common health condition, which affects 1 in 10 women of child bearing age. That’s 1.5 million people in the UK.\nIn endometriosis, cells similar to those usually found in the lining of the womb, grow in other parts of the body. These are called “endometrial deposits” and they can be found on the ovaries, bladder, bowels, pelvic and abdominal walls and in rare cases, even places like the lining of the lung.\nAs your body moves through its natural menstrual cycle, the womb lining thickens to create a nice home for a potential fertilised egg, before shedding and bleeding if no pregnancy occurs. \nThe symptoms of endometriosis are caused by these endometrial cell deposits outside the womb responding to your menstrual cycle in the same way – thickening and then bleeding. \nAs this occurs in places where there is less space for the cells to thicken, and nowhere for blood to escape, this causes pain, chronic inflammation and scar tissue (also known as adhesions). This contributes to the wide range of symptoms people with endometriosis may suffer from.\nOkay… so what is adenomyosis?\nAdenomyosis is a condition where the tissue that lines the inside of the womb can be found deep in the muscle of the womb. This causes problems as it bleeds cyclically and causes pain within the muscle of the womb. It can affect up to 1 in 10 people with a uterus. Symptoms include heavy painful periods and heaviness or discomfort deep in the pelvis.\nWhat are the symptoms of endometriosis?\nThe symptoms are really variable for each woman, and not necessarily related to how severe or how many endometrial deposits there are. Symptoms can also be very vague and overlap with other common problems such as IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) or pelvic infections.\nThe signs that I look out for include the following:\n\nPainful periods which start from 1-2 days before bleeding and continue throughout the bleed. The pain can often be debilitating, meaning women miss school, university or work regularly during their period\nHeavy periods, long periods, spotting in between periods or losing old, dark blood before your period starts\nPain deep within your pelvis or abdomen during sex or internal medical examinations\nPain or bleeding when going to the toilet (bladder or bowels) while on your period\nDifficulty getting pregnant. Although it is important to remember that 70% of women with endometriosis fall pregnant naturally\nFatigue, lethargy and mood changes which are understandable when you read through the symptoms above!\n\n\nWhat causes endometriosis?\nIt is very frustrating for every endometriosis sufferer and those of us who treat it, that we don’t exactly know how or why the condition happens. There are theories, but nothing has been scientifically proven. \nOne theory called “Retrograde Menstruation” suggests that during a period some of the womb lining travels the wrong way up the fallopian tubes and ends up depositing in the pelvis or abdomen. Another called “Metaplasia” suggests that some cells in the body are able to change to cells found in the womb lining in response to inflammation or certain toxins. \nWe have seen some research that shows endometriosis can run in families and there could be a genetic factor. However, none of these have been proven and the real cause could perhaps be a combination of many different ideas. At The Lowdown, we’re hoping science can help us out and finally come up with an answer!\nHow is endometriosis diagnosed?\nThe average time it takes for a woman to receive a definitive diagnosis of endometriosis is 7 years from when symptoms begin. We completely understand this leaves women feeling fed up, exhausted and perhaps even losing trust with the healthcare system.\nThe length of time it takes to diagnose endometriosis could be partly due to the symptoms, which can be vague and similar to other common conditions, but also because there is no simple test. There is no blood test, no clear physical examination signs and even an internal ultrasound scan may only show endometriosis if it is severe enough to cause cysts on the ovaries.\nI think I have endometriosis – what next?\nIf having read everything so far you think you could have endometriosis, an important first step in the journey is to openly ask your GP or healthcare provider if they had considered that endometriosis could be a cause of your symptoms and start a discussion.\nThe “gold standard” for diagnosing endometriosis is via a laparoscopy. This is a small key hole operation in which a camera is inserted into the abdomen and pelvis to look for endometrial deposits. If these are found, they may be treated at the same time.\nHowever, this procedure does involve risks. You will require a general anaesthetic and abdominal surgery is invasive with risks including pain, infection, bleeding and damage to organs such as perforating the bladder or bowel walls. Most women are so fed up with their symptoms they are happy to take these risks for a diagnosis, other women prefer to try treatment options first. This is a personal decision, and I’d advise you to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of both options with your doctor.\nHow is endometriosis treated?\nFirstly, it’s important to know that endometriosis can actually get better of its own accord without treatment in some women – such a mysterious disease!\nHowever, as the symptoms can so greatly affect your quality of life, the majority of women opt for active treatment. \nTreatment options for endometriosis are:\n\nPain relief – endometriosis can be exceptionally painful and medications such as anti-inflammatories (such as ibuprofen) can help relieve this or TENS products such as Myoovi \nSupplements – nutrients found in supplements like Wild Nutrition can help overcome symptoms such as; tiredness & fatigue as well as act as hormone regulators\nSurgery – during a laparoscopy, endometrial deposits can be cut or burned away and any scar tissue that has formed can be removed\nHormonal treatment – this can include hormonal contraceptives (which can be prescribed by your GP), or hormonal injections to turn off your menstrual cycle called Gonadotrophin Releasing Hormone Agonists (these are only available from hospital specialists)\nPelvic physiotherapy can be magical and is not invasive. Expert women’s health physios, such as our resident Kathryn, can assess your areas of pain and suggest specific exercises to help ease it.\nComplementary therapies – never underestimate the power of a healthy lifestyle, diet and exercise for helping to relieve pain and improve your mood – some women also find treatments including acupuncture, reflexology and homeopathy helpful. The hormonal contraceptive option is where The Lowdown’s expertise lies. Many of our users suffer from endometriosis, and are using our platform to find the most suitable method for them.\n\nDoes the contraceptive pill help endometriosis?\nCombined hormonal contraceptives thin out the womb lining, prevent ovulation, lighten or even stop periods. This means that endometrial deposits can become smaller without the hormonal stimulation of the menstrual cycle. \nTaking the combined pill in a continuous method could offer the greatest relief in symptoms by minimising the number of bleeds you have a year. Find out more about continuous pill taking. These benefits often lead to an improvement in symptoms and can reduce inflammation and scar tissue.\n\nDoes the Mirena coil help endometriosis?\nYes it does too! The hormonal IUS also thins out the womb lining and typically your periods are 90% lighter. 20% of women who use the Mirena coil (a brand of hormonal IUS) will have no periods at all after 12 months, hopefully practically resolving those endometriosis symptoms experienced around period time.\nWhich is the best birth control for endometriosis?\nAny hormonal contraceptive can be beneficial for endometriosis.\nAt The Lowdown, we believe contraceptive choice should be individualised based on your preferences and desire to avoid certain side effects. But here are some facts that may help you make your decision.\n\nResearch has shown that combined hormonal contraceptives and the IUS can be used as treatment for endometriosis and are equally effective at improving symptoms \nThe progestogen-only pill, implant and injection such as Sayana Press also help symptoms, but aren’t considered the “first line treatment” as there has been less research into these methods\nScientific evidence demonstrates that combined hormonal contraception can prevent endometrial deposits from returning after surgical treatment\n\nThere is one rule I have for endometriosis sufferers, and that is to not use the copper coil (IUD). This is because its side effects include longer, heavier and more painful periods, and we don’t want bleeding from those endometrial deposits outside the womb to be longer, heavier and more painful!\nYou may choose to start hormonal contraception to relieve your symptoms even before a diagnosis is formally made, and this often happens in day to day life. \nIf you choose to wait for diagnosis and treatment via a laparoscopy, specialists recommend starting hormonal contraception as soon as possible after surgical treatment. Options such as the hormonal IUS could even be inserted at the time of your surgery while you are under anaesthetic if you discuss this beforehand.\nAs to which hormonal contraceptive is best for you, it really is your choice. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) also has a fantastic resource which I often share with patients to help you make a decision. \nYou can also go through our website, read our reviews or book in for individualised medical advice using our Speak to A Doctor service. \nEndometriosis can be a life changing diagnosis. Please remember you are not alone and there is a community out there to support you.

She is currently working as a salaried GP partner in Sheffield with an interest in complex medical patients and women’s health.

        "Content": "\nMaking the decision to come off contraception is a big one. And if you’re looking to start a family right away, it can bring the topic of fertility to the forefront of your mind. But how exactly does contraception impact a woman’s fertility? Let’s take a look.\n👀 If you think you’ll find this blog interesting, make sure to check out our newsletter for more:\n\nFamily planning: a phrase that conjures up the image of a 1950s housewife and her desire for 2.4 children with her darling husband living in an idyllic house in the country. Whilst this may inhabit the realms of truth, family planning and access to services supporting this are actually central to gender equality and women’s empowerment. It is defined by the World Health Organization as the process which allows “people to attain their desired number of children, if any, and to determine the spacing of their pregnancies. It is achieved through use of contraceptive methods and the treatment of infertility”¹, or put simply, controlling when pregnancy occurs. The ability to determine whether or not to become pregnant, and how many children to have, has long been recognised as a human right. \nFor many women not yet ready to start a family – and living in the harsh realities of the present day – this looks more like the active avoidance of pregnancy mixed with the occasional fear of missed pills, incorrect calculations of dates, and other mishaps where we may not have ‘planned’ things quite carefully enough!\nBut when that 180 flip in thinking hits, and our mindsets switch from ‘I hope I don’t get pregnant’ to ‘I want nothing more than to have a baby’, we might find ourselves questioning whether our thoughts and actions surrounding family planning should have come a little sooner.\nSo when exactly should you start thinking about your fertility? And should you be concerned about the impact the contraceptive pill may have?\nDoes being on the pill affect fertility?\nWhether you’re taking the combined pill back-to-back or taking a monthly break, there is no evidence to suggest the use of combined hormonal contraceptives has any long-term impact on fertility. Some may be concerned about the length of time they’ve been on the pill, but this, too, has no impact.\nIt is possible to get pregnant as soon as you stop taking the combined pill and begin to ovulate again (any time from 7 days after your last packet has finished). Studies show the majority of women will ovulate within a month of stopping the pill.² However, it is important to remember when you stop using the pill, your fertility will return to whatever is normal for you, i.e. whether you are able to get pregnant will be the same for you whether or not you have used contraception, bearing in mind any increase in age and the effect this will have.\nHere at The Lowdown, we conducted our very own survey to determine what happened to women’s periods after they stopped their method of contraception. We asked women using the combined pill, the progestogen-only pill, the implant, the hormonal coil and the copper coil:\n’How long did it take for your period cycle to return to normal after you stopped using this method of contraception?’ \nOf course, everyone’s ‘normal’ is different, but we asked women to consider their own personal experiences. Of those surveyed, the majority found a return to normal within 6 months, with The Faculty of Sexual & Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH) reporting studies that show 99% of women return to their normal cycle or get pregnant within 3 months.²\nA return to normal cycles is always reassuring, but it’s important to remember that periods do not necessarily equal fertility. But, more on that later.\nBut what about fertility after the contraceptive injection?\nWe also surveyed women who had previously used the contraceptive injection, asking them the same question about their menstrual cycle. This is where we found things took a little longer. Our results show it took up to 18 months in some cases for women to return to their normal menstrual cycles.\nA study carried out looking at the link between the use of contraceptives and a woman’s ability to become pregnant found the contraceptive injection did indeed result in the longest delay to the return of fertility.³ But why should this be the case?\nThe contraceptive injection works by stopping ovulation and commonly causes changes to bleeding patterns, including stopping periods which many find is a beneficial side-effect. One user of The Lowdown wrote:\n“Really recommend the injection. Loved that it stopped my periods completely. No effect on my mood which was great as other contraceptives I’ve used have made my mood really low. Really convenient only having to get it every 12 weeks.”\nDue to the link (known as the menstrual cycle!) between periods and ovulation – where the all-important egg is released in preparation for fertilisation – the delay in the return of your periods may be associated with a delay in the return of ovulation, and may result in a knock-on effect on your chances of conception.\nThis delay, however, is only short-term. And while you may be experiencing irregular cycles after stopping the injection, you may be ovulating. Over 80% of women trying to conceive may expect to become pregnant within 15 months of their last Depo-Provera injection and after 2 years there is no significant difference in pregnancy rates when compared with users of non-hormonal contraception.⁴\nWaiting for your fertility to return after stopping the injection can be a stressful experience, so if you’re planning a pregnancy in the next few years think about the options available to you, such as switching from the injection to another method in the meantime. \n\nHow long does it take to get pregnant after coming off the pill?\nIf only there was an easy answer! We know that there is no evidence to suggest that the combined pill results in long-term reduction in fertility. After an initial delay following discontinuation of the pill, most women will become pregnant within 3 menstrual cycles and pregnancy rates in the 1 to 2 years that follow are comparable with those who had previously used barrier methods or no method of contraception at all.²\nBut there are many factors that come into play when thinking about a woman’s ability to conceive. Age, genetic factors, lifestyle, and medical conditions such as PCOS are all factors that can influence the chances of conception. We also know that in around half of cases where couples struggle to get pregnant this is to do with the male partner.⁵\nMy periods haven’t yet returned. Can I still get pregnant?\nActually, yes! This is all down to the timing of ovulation. Occurring around 2 weeks before your period, it is possible for you to become pregnant on that first ovulation before your periods have returned. So, in theory, you could become pregnant after stopping your contraception without having had a period.\nThe same can be said for irregular cycles. Ovulation may still occur, just not in a particularly regular fashion. This means you are still able to get pregnant even if your cycle hasn’t yet returned to normal. But remember, irregular periods can be a sign of an underlying issue, one which may have been masked (or effectively treated) by the use of contraceptives. So, it’s important to discuss any concerns you have with your doctor.\nOn the flip-side of this, the return of periods are not necessarily an indicator of fertility. It is possible for a woman to have bleeding, like a period but for her not to ovulate. There are also other causes of fertility problems that are not to do with ovulation, including blocked or damaged fallopian tubes and endometriosis.\nTo find out more information on fertility, check out our free webinar. Our founder Alice talks to Consultant Gynaecologist and Subspecialist in Reproductive Medicine and Surgery, James Nicopoullos, alongside fertility advocate and IVF mum, Alice Rose. They delve deeper into the causes of infertility and the options available to those struggling to conceive.\nStart planning!\nIt may seem like a distant wish right now, but thinking about the future and your desire to have a family should be a factor when considering your contraception options, especially if the injection is a main contender. If you’re thinking about coming off contraception to try to conceive, know the time to get pregnant is impossible to predict and it could happen sooner or later than you think. Be prepared, think about how to optimise your health and start taking folic acid and vitamin D supplements before stopping contraception. \nThe supplements listed above are Amazon affiliate links our doctors recommend – we earn a small commission too ❤️\nThis blog can help you learn more about various contraception options, but it does not give medical advice.

        "Content": "\nBig thank you to @gynaegeek for letting us use her brilliant cervical ectropion diagram!⁠ \nWhat’s the lowdown?\n\n\n\nMy experience of cervical ectropion\nHave you ever been for a routine smear or gynae examination, and having gone through the drama of getting half naked and deep breathing through the embarrassment, been told that you have a “cervical ectropion”?\nDid those unknown words send shivers of anxiety through your body? Well, it did for me as a young medical student and hopefully, this will help calm some of your nerves.\nIt was after I had my first Mirena IUS coil fitted. I had found the procedure OK and after the first 2 months or so of slight anxiety and jawline acne, I was absolutely loving the endless possibilities of a period free life. I felt more comfortable and confident around sex until one drunken Saturday night after the deed, it looked as though a small animal had been sacrified on my sheets. There was blood everywhere.\nHaving learnt from lectures that bleeding = bad. I quickly took myself off to the GP. She promptly told me to wee on a stick before asking me to assume the position for a speculum examination and swabs. Thankfully, pregnancy was excluded which gave me a moment to allow the sweat to cool on my palms before she joyfully announced that I had a cervical ectropion. This was “a benign finding and nothing to worry about” so I was sent on my way.\nAt this point, I hadn’t reached the gynaecology phase of my university lectures so turned to Wikipedia and found very little information. So now, as a Medical Director of The Lowdown, here is what I wish I’d known then…\nWhat is a cervical ectropion?\n\nA cervical ectropion (sometimes called a cervical erosion) is a normal finding in young women of reproductive age. It is common and prevalent in between 17-50% of people with wombs including up to 80% of sexually active adolescents. They often cause no problems at all and can be found on routine smears. \nTo understand what an ectropion is, we need to talk about anatomy and pathology. The cervix is a tube-like structure at the top of the vagina connected to the uterus – we often refer to it as “the neck of the womb”.\nThe inside of the cervix is lined with a certain type of cell. This cell type is glandular which means it is soft, produces lots of mucus and bleeds more easily if it is hit by something (e.g. a penis). On the outside of the cervix, which your doctor can see during a smear test, the cells are harder, produce less mucus and are less likely to bleed. \nIn a cervical ectropion, the soft, red, mucous producing cells from the inside of the cervix, move onto the outside of the cervix. Here, you can see a redder, well defined ring around the cervix opening which is how healthcare professionals make the diagnosis.\nSymptoms of cervical ectropion or erosion\nNow we understand what a cervical ectropion is, the symptoms may not surprise you. Women may suffer from increased vaginal discharge (the most common symptom), bleeding after sex (in 5-25% of women with an ectropion), pain after sex or occasionally bleeding in between periods. \nPlease ALWAYS see you GP if you notice a change in your discharge, bleeding after sex or bleeding in between periods to confirm if a cervical ectropion is the cause.\nWhat causes a cervical ectropion or erosion?\nCervical ectropion is caused by hormonal changes. This is why they are more common in younger people, people going through puberty, pregnant women and those using certain contraceptives.\nHow is a cervical ectropion or erosion related to contraception?\nThe changes in the cells lining the cervix are driven by oestrogen and a change in the oestrogen/progesterone ratio in your body. Pregnancy and combined hormonal contraception can therefore increase the chance of a cervical ectropion. \nWe know that a number of our Lowdown community who have used our Get Advice service have suffered from symptoms related to cervical ectropion. These symptoms may affect your contraceptive choice and you may want to stop taking the combined pill.\nCervical Ectropion / Erosion, Fertility and Pregnancy\nHaving a cervical erosion does not affect your fertility, so you are just as likely to fall pregnant if you are trying to conceive. Once you are pregnant, the higher levels of oestrogen circulating in your body can cause cervical erosion so they are commonly seen in pregnant women. Remember, if you do have any bleeding in pregnancy, be sure to see a doctor for examination, even if you are known to have a cervical ectropion.\nCervical Ectropion / Erosion v Cancer\nYou may worry, but please don’t, there is no evidence that a cervical ectropion increases the risk of getting cervical cancer. Cervical ectropion and cervical cancer are completely separate conditions, with different causes and are not linked at all.\nWhat options are there for cervical ectropion treatment?\nFirstly, you don’t always need to treat a cervical ectropion. If the symptoms from the ectropion are really annoying, you may be advised to stop any combined hormonal contraception and offered to change to an alternative (eg progestogen only contraceptive or non-hormonal methods). If you are happy with your hormonal contraception or are not currently using any hormones, procedures may be carried out in a gynaecology clinic to treat the cervical ectropion. These include:\n\nDiathermy. This treatment uses an electrical current running through a small metal instrument to remove the ectropion cells on the cervix. It is usually carried out with local anaesthetic to numb the area.\nCryotherapy. A small thin instrument with liquid nitrogen on the tip is used to freeze away the cervical ectropion cells. This can be done without local anaesthetic and should not be painful. Some women describe some mild cramping pain and feeling warm throughout their body.\nSilver Nitrate. This is another substance which can be placed on a small thin stick and pressed against the cervical ectropion to remove the cells. It should not be painful but can feel either warm or cold.\n\nWhat happens during treatment for cervical ectropion?\nYou will be asked to lie on a bed and a speculum will be inserted to look at the cervix. This step is very similar to a cervical screening smear test.\nIf local anaesthetic is needed, this may sting as it starts to work. Any of the treatments above should not take any longer than 10 minutes.\nIf you are uncomfortable at any point, let a healthcare professional know.\nWhat happens after treatment?\nYou can leave the clinic 15 minutes after treatment, and you are able to drive if you would like to. For 2 days afterwards, you may experience period like cramping, light bleeding or watery discharge. If this continues or gets worse, or you develop a fever then see a doctor.\nYou should avoid using a tampon or penetrative sex for 4 weeks after treatment.\nOccasionally, a cervical ectropion may return. You are able to have another treatment but it is recommended to wait for at least 6 weeks between treatments.\nOther things I wish I’d known…\n\nIf left alone, cervical ectropions will disappear as you get older.\nCervical ectropion does not increase your risk of cervical cancer. At all. \nCervical ectropion might make you more susceptible to STIs including chlamydia. This is because the bug which causes chlamydia likes to infect the softer, glandular cells found within an ectropion. Some studies have found an increased risk of gonorrhoea and HIV infection, although this is still being debated within the research world. So, as always, you may consider getting regular STI checks and using condoms with new partners.\n\n  \nOne of The Lowdown’s fab Clinical Directors, Dr Frances Yarlett MBBCh (Hons) BSc (Hons) MRCP (2016) MRCGP DFSRH completed her medical training from Cardiff University in 2013.

        "Content": "\nThis is a huge step in the right direction. The progestogen-only pill is incredibly safe and effective – it can be used by most women irrespective of age, smoking status and many medical conditions. Getting your blood pressure and BMI checked is not necessary.\nWe have long advocated for this change and welcome any move from the UK Government to remove barriers to contraceptive access.\nWhat we think\nThe Lowdown wholeheartedly supports the change in legislation which will make the progestogen-only pill available over the counter, without a prescription.\nHowever, in making this change pharmacists and medical professionals need to be better trained to counsel women and help them recognise, understand and address their contraceptive side effects\nWe were shocked to find that in the Lovima Pharmacy Consultation Checklist for pharmacists, there was only mention of two side effects; bleeding and allergic reactions – and mention of very rare side effects thrombosis, liver problems and ectopic pregnancy.\nSide effects are the number one reason that women discontinue contraception, or take it incorrectly – and The Lowdown strongly believes that not forewarning women about these, and helping them manage them, is a huge mistake. \nThe Lowdown proposes that the pharmacist discusses the possible side effects and explains that a woman may experience them – ensures she understands this, and advises her to come back to the pharmacist if they need further help or the side effects become intolerable.\nWhy is this change happening?\nThis decision comes on the back of a lengthy consultation period from the Medicine & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) on the proposal to make progestogen-only pills available from pharmacies.\nThe MHRA sought views from patients, pharmacists, prescribers, and a wide range of organisations including the Royal College of Gynaecologists, Royal Pharmaceutical Society, Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare, and British Pregnancy Advisory Service.\nThe public consultation received almost 500 responses, with over 80% being in favour of the reclassification.\nWhy can’t women just get it from their GP?\nOver the past few years, budget cuts to sexual health services have meant that women are finding it increasingly difficult to access their contraceptive of choice.\nAccording to the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare, more than 8 million women of reproductive age are now living in an area where their local councils have reduced funding for these services.\nThis means that women are facing clinic closures, or longer waiting times, fewer appointments, and reduced staff or opening hours. This, combined with the backlog created from the pandemic has meant that women are increasingly losing their reproductive autonomy.\nBritish Pregnancy Advisory Service, the UK’s largest abortion provider, told The Independent they provided the progestogen-only contraceptive pill to almost 10,000 women undergoing an abortion between May and October last year.\nAll Party Parliamentary Group on Sexual and Reproductive Health in the UK  – Report:\n\nAlmost half of councils have reduced the number of sites delivering contraceptive services in at least one year since 2015, whilst 13% of councils have reduced the number of sites over multiple years.16 \n11% of councils reduced the number of contracts with GPs to fit LARC in 2018/19.17 \nSRH contraceptive services are being commissioned with a reduced service offer. This can lead to reduced access to different methods of contraception or discrepancies based on age, or residency \n41% of GPs in England reported an increased number of appointments for contraceptive advice.18 \n\n\nIs this just in England?\nAlthough healthcare is a devolved matter across the UK, this legislation will enable all British pharmacies to sell progestogen-only pills without a prescription. This means that it should be available in England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.\nWhat pill is it?\nThe progestogen-only contraceptive pills that will be sold over the counter are Lovima 75 microgram film-coated tablets, and Hana 75 microgram film-coated tablets.  You can buy Hana online as well as Lovima here at The Lowdown.\nThese pills contain exactly the same ingredients as Cerazette, Cerelle, Zelleta, Desogestrel, Aizea, Desomono and Desorex. More information on brands available can be found on The Lowdown’s website here.\nBoth of these contain desogestrel and can be taken without having your blood pressure or BMI checked – irrespective of age, smoking status, and many other medical conditions that may need to be considered when prescribing different types of pill, such as the combined pill.\nWhy is it paid?\nThe UK Government provides free access to prescribed contraception through NHS prescriptions. As this pill is not prescribed, a small fee is incurred for the user. \nIt’s just like choosing to buy emergency contraception from the pharmacy. You can get it for free via your GP or for a small fee at a pharmacy.\nHow much does it cost?\nThe progestogen-only pills Lovima and Hana will be available for as little as £7.50 for a one month supply.\nThe Lowdown will start providing Lovima and Hana through our online ordering service in due course, and in the meantime you can buy other brands of the same pill through us.\nCan I still get it for free?\nYou can still get the progestogen-only pill for free via an NHS prescription obtained through your GP or sexual health clinic.\n",

        "Content": "\nIn this guide we’ll look at blood and discharge of a spectrum of colours and consistencies, particularly in relation to ovulation. Throughout this whistle-stop tour of bodily fluids, we’ll look at the signs to watch out for, what the different symptoms could mean, and when to call the GP. \n✅ If you think you’ll find this blog interesting, check out our newsletter for more:\n\nWhat is ovulation?\nThe beginning and end of your menstrual cycle is marked by your period. Somewhere in the middle is ovulation (in a 28 day cycle it’s roughly on day 14). It really isn’t an exact science though – research shows variance in ovulation date and cycle length which is only going to get more compelling as we accrue data from menstrual tracking apps. Now where were we… \nIn a nutshell, ovulation is when a mature egg is released from one of your ovaries into the fallopian tubes. In general, the 5 days before and 2 days after ovulation occurs is your ‘fertile window’ if you’re trying to get pregnant. You can read more about ovulation and the hormonal changes of the menstrual cycle in our guide. \nWhat is ovulation bleeding? \nSome women experience light bleeding or spotting around ovulation: during, after and the days before. This can be totally normal and studies have shown that mid-cycle spotting may affect around 4.8% of women. The figures vary however, as another study of women exclusively not on oral contraceptives showed a 13.3% rate of spotting mid cycle. \nWhat causes ovulation bleeding and spotting?\nGenerally, the thinking is that the rapid drop in oestrogen around ovulation causes spotting mid cycle. However, evidence from other studies shows that there can be higher oestrogen levels around ovulation and during the luteal phase, as well as higher luteal progesterone and LH levels. (See our menstrual cycle guide for a refresher of some of those terms). \nBasically, during ovulation there is a cascade of hormonal changes which occur and this is likely behind ovulation bleeding. \nHow do I spot (excuse the pun) ovulation bleeding and how long does it last?\nOvulation bleeding varies from pink to a light red. The flow is extremely light (enough to maybe need a pantiliner, or even a pair of period pants from WUKA or Modibodi, but we aren’t talking pad levels). You might not even realise that you’re spotting until you go to the toilet and see blood on the tissue, or pinkish toned vaginal discharge. \nStudies show that spotting lasts 1-2 days and doesn’t seem to impact ovulation.\nLooking at your discharge throughout the month (I mean, what else is there to do these days), can be a nifty way to predict ovulation and whether it coincides with bleeding. Ovulation discharge is stretchy and raw egg-white like, peaking 1-2 days before ovulation, when oestrogen is highest.\nOther signs to look out for:\n\nOvulation pain ‘mittelschmerz’\n\n\n\n\n‘middle pain’ in German – fun fact\nA cramp felt in the lower abdomen (either side) lasting a few days around the time of ovulation (find out more about ovulation pain and cramping)\n\n\n\n\nBasal Body Temperature (BBT)\n\n\nIncreases slightly around ovulation with rising progesterone\nTrack BBT to see if bleeding coincides with the temperature rise \n\n\n\nShould I be alarmed about ovulation spotting?\nFor starters, don’t panic if you experience bleeding during or before ovulation. For some women, this is the normal physiological response that their body has to hormonal changes. And, generally, spotting between periods is fairly common, affecting up to 13% of those menstruating. \nBut, like with everything else, it’s important to visit your GP to confirm that the bleeding is not caused by something else (especially if it’s a new change to your bleeding pattern).\n\nOther causes of bleeding during ovulation\nSome women experience intermenstrual bleeding (basically any other bleeding between your period), or post-coital bleeding (this occurs after sex). \nReasons for these types of bleeding are:\nContraception\nAll forms of hormonal contraception, including the combined and mini pill can be associated with irregular bleeding and spotting. We’re not exactly sure why, but evidence suggests it could be changes to the structure of the womb lining and its blood vessels, in response to the hormones in contraceptives. \nBleeding patterns differ widely e.g. 20% of women experience irregular bleeding on the combined pill within the first 3 months which tends to then settle. With the mini pill, the bleeding seems to be more unpredictable and unlikely to lessen with time.\nSexually Transmitted Infections\nCertain STI’s such as chlamydia or gonorrhoea can cause bleeding between periods. It is important to be regularly tested, as if left untreated these STI’s can develop into pelvic inflammatory disease (an upper genital tract infection with symptoms including bleeding, pain, abnormal discharge and fever). \nImplantation bleeding and pregnancy\nHistorically, studies suggested that implantation can cause light pink or brown spotting as the fertilised egg comes into contact with the blood cells of the uterine lining (6-12 days after ovulation). Many women do not experience implantation bleeding, and some studies have shown no link between implantation and bleeding – so the picture is unclear. \nHowever, bleeding in early pregnancy is common, with 10-15% of women reporting it within the first 16 weeks. One study found that implantation bleeding was uncommon and it was more likely that women experienced 1 to 2 days of light bleeding around the time when their period would have been (around 5 days after implantation).\nCervical changes\nUp to 9% of women experience bleeding after sex. This can be associated with changes to the cervix due to: \n\nPolyp: Benign, red and ‘bulb shaped’ cervical growths that can cause bleeding after sex. They can be spotted during your smear test and removed if causing nuisance symptoms.\nCervical Ectropion (AKA erosion): A normal variation commonly in women of reproductive age, where softer cells which more easily bleed move to the outside of the cervix (they can also lead to increased vaginal discharge). Dr Fran’s cervical ectropion guide is a treasure trove of info. \nPre-cancerous changes: The Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) is extremely common in sexually active adults. The presence of these cell changes does not mean that you’re going to get cervical cancer, but it is important that they are monitored and appropriately treated (i.e. by removal of the cells). Find out more in our guide to HPV.\n\nSome of the above sounds pretty scary, but don’t panic. These changes can be identified on examination by your doctor or when you have your smear test – so please don’t put the appointment off when you get your letter through. No one will give a jot about your pubic hair or how you smell ‘down there’ and it’s over in a flash (then you can treat yourself to something nice). Just do it. \nUterine bleeding\nThis is typically bleeding from the womb lining, and women tend to experience intermenstrual bleeding. There is a 30% likelihood of having post-coital bleeds too. Causes include polyps, fibroids (benign growths) and adenomyosis (thickening of the uterine tissue). These can often be identified by an ultrasound scan of the uterus.\nOther causes include hormone imbalances where you aren’t ovulating properly (such as polycystic ovary syndrome) or thyroid dysfunction. If the cause is identified your GP can discuss treatment options with you, but sometimes there isn’t an obvious cause.\nThe important point is if you notice changes to your bleeding pattern, consider doing a pregnancy test (you can order 2 Clearblue tests from our Amazon affiliate link) and getting an STI check up, and check your last smear test is in date. If changes to your bleeding pattern persist for longer than three months, are bothersome or are associated with other symptoms, then contact your GP. \n\nMoving onto vaginal discharge – is it normal?\nCreamy, thick, sticky? Getting to know your discharge can provide insights as to what’s going on in your cycle. It is 100% normal for women of reproductive age to have discharge, it is meant to keep the vagina lubricated, a dry vagina would be very uncomfortable! Normal vaginal discharge will decline around the menopause, as oestrogen levels drop, and vaginal dryness is a recognised symptom of the menopause. \nNormal discharge is white or clear and ‘non-offensive’ in smell (i.e. it’s not a bottle of Chanel no.5, but equally shouldn’t have a fishy or foul odour). Depending on your phase of the menstrual cycle, texture, quantity, and even smell, can change, most notably with the stretchy and slippery discharge leading up to and around ovulation. To get an idea of stretchiness, you should be able to slowly part your index finger and thumb, with the discharge able to stretch and expand in between. \nHow does the pill affect discharge?\nAll hormonal methods of contraception, including the combined and mini pills rely on the action of synthetic hormones, which thicken cervical mucus as a barrier to sperm penetration and increase vaginal discharge. Cervical ectropion can cause vaginal discharge, and this is also more common with use of combined contraception. Whichever pill type you’re on, it is completely normal to have increased discharge quantity or thickness. \nAnd finally, when is discharge a sign of something else?\nFirst up, any changes to colour, smell, quantity or texture of discharge are worth further investigation. You might also experience symptoms such as a burning sensation when weeing, itching and pelvic pain.\nChanges to vaginal discharge may be due to:\n\nBacterial Vaginosis (BV)– caused by normal bacteria that live in the vagina, can cause watery discharge with a fishy smell \nThrush – caused by a yeast called candida, can cause characteristic white ‘cottage cheese’ discharge, often with an itchy, red vulva (the area around the outside of the vagina)\n\nIf you’ve had thrush or BV before you may be able to recognise the symptoms. Most cases get better within a few days but you can also seek advice and over the counter treatments from your pharmacist, or your GP/sexual health clinic if needed.\nIn some cases vaginal discharge is due to an infection: \n\nCervicitis –  an inflamed cervix which can be caused by chlamydia or gonorrhea. \nTrichomoniasis – a parasitic STI which can lead to green or yellow discharge \n\nYour GP or sexual health clinic can diagnose the cause by listening to your symptoms, examining you and sending swabs from the vagina to the lab to be tested.\n\nEmma is a Pharmacology & Physiology graduate with a huge passion for women’s health.

        "Title": "Can The Contraceptive Pill Cause Hair Loss?",
        "Content": "\n✅ If you think you’ll find this blog interesting, you can check out our newsletter for more:\n\nWhat is hair loss?\nRemoving small bundles of hair from the plughole post-shower or cutting long strands free from the hoover may be a common occurrence for a lot of us. The regularity at which we carry out this somewhat icky chore may not be that surprising when you consider we all lose between 50 and 100 hairs a day. But for some, hair loss can happen on a much more severe – and distressing – level.\nAlopecia is the medical term given to describe hair loss. It is a general term used to cover all types of hair loss; from diffuse thinning, where there is a general loss of hair across the whole scalp, to localised hair loss, a condition only affecting specific patches.\nFinding hair on your pillow or noticing a bald patch can be emotional, to say the least. But hair loss is not usually a sign of anything serious, although it can be an indicator of an underlying issue. Causes can be wide-ranging, from hormonal imbalances, vitamin deficiencies, illness, medications or stress. Pinpointing the cause is crucial to receiving the right treatment, which is why a diagnosis from your GP is so important.\nNow let’s take a look at the phases of hair growth, the science behind the contraceptive pill and hair loss, and how some contraceptives could actually do the exact opposite – hello long, luscious locks!\n\nWhat are the stages of hair growth?\nThe hair growth cycle involves four phases:\n\nAnagen, or growth phase\nCatagen phase\nTelogen, or dormant phase\nExogen phase\n\nIn the first phase of the growth cycle, hair will grow approximately 1cm a month for around 3 to 5 years. The length of the phase varies between individuals and for different areas of the body. Eyebrow hairs will have a much shorter anagen phase, for example, hence why they don’t grow as long as the hair on your head!\nNext, we move to the catagen phase. This only lasts around 10 days; hair growth slows, the follicle shrinks, and the hair detaches from the follicle, although it remains on the scalp.\nThe telogen phase lasts a little longer, at around 3 months. The hair no longer continues to grow, but a new hair will start to form in the follicle.\nThe final phase involves the shedding of the hair and continues for between 2 and 5 months. This is the phase in which 50-100 hairs a day will fall out!\n\nHair loss and stress on the body \nWhen a trigger such as childbirth, illness, or a major trauma occurs, an increased number of hairs move from the growing phase to the telogen phase resulting in an increase in hairs shed over this time. This is called telogen effluvium. Hair will generally appear thinner with less volume and is most commonly seen in women 1-3 months after giving birth. Hair will grow back and will return to its pre-baby thickness after a few months, but contact your doctor if your hair continues to thin. \nOther common triggers of telogen effluvium include significant weight loss and extreme dieting, or starting new medication, however no cause is found in around a third of people diagnosed with telogen effluvium. Hair volume will gradually return to normal after a few months but can recur if the underlying trigger returns or is not treated.\n\nWhat are androgens?\nAndrogens are hormones typically associated with men, with testosterone, perhaps, the most famous of the androgens. So, why are we talking about them in relation to female contraception? Despite their well-known relationship with the male body, androgens are also produced in lower quantities and play a crucial role in the female body.\nPCOS and hair loss\nThe most common form of alopecia in women is female pattern hair loss (FPHL). Due to both genetic and hormonal influences, affected follicles produce hairs that become shorter and smaller, and lighter in colour. Ultimately, these follicles completely shrink and no longer produce hairs.\nPolycystic ovary syndrome can give rise to elevated androgen levels and can result in FPHL. Whilst there is currently no cure for PCOS, symptoms, such as hair loss, can benefit from treatments from your healthcare professional.\n\nWhat does all this have to do with the pill?\nThe combined contraceptive pill contains artificial versions of oestrogen and progesterone. The synthetic form of progesterone is called progestin. This has the ability to be androgenic, meaning it can create an androgenic response, triggering symptoms such as hair loss, hirsutism (abnormal hair growth) and acne or oily skin to name a few.\nAndrogens play a major role in the regulation of hair follicles; in puberty, they trigger pubic hair growth in both men and women. But, due to their ability to alter the growth phase of a hair and the length of time the hair is in this phase, the progestin in the pill, and its androgenic response, may have the potential to cause hair loss.\n\nDo all birth control pills cause hair loss?\nBecause progestin is the possible culprit, the progestogen-only pill (aka mini-pill), as well as the combined contraceptive pill, both have the potential to cause hair loss or thinning as a side effect.\nBut it’s not necessarily that simple. Hormonal contraceptives can often be talked about collectively, but they can still vary hugely in terms of their side effects due to their differing active ingredients, and in this case, their androgenic effects.\nOne user of The Lowdown left a review of her experience with the mini pill, Cerazette, and hair thinning: \n“Slightly more hair loss from my head but not hugely noticeable or impactful. Just more falls out when I brush it”\nOne Lowdown user told us about her experience with the Microgynon contraceptive pill, and hair loss: \n“Really good with mood and balancing side effects. Only negative was skin and hair loss. My hair thinned to less than half the volume it was before so I am coming off it to go on something else. My skin was ok but more spotty than my previous pill.” \nThe Lowdown’s guide to androgens explains the complexities regarding data on androgenic activity. Whilst we know the potential effects of androgens in the body, a lot more research is needed to determine a greater understanding of the role hormonal contraceptives may play in causing hair loss.\n\nHow to stop hair loss from birth control\nWhilst hair loss could be considered a side effect of contraceptives, the benefits in preventing pregnancy outweigh the risk of hair loss for most individuals. But this doesn’t take away from the devastating effect of hair loss for people. Ideally, if you have a personal or family history of hair loss then try a contraceptive with a lowest or even anti-androgenic effect or a non-hormonal method like the copper coil. See our guide on androgens which explains this in more detail.\nHair loss recovery after stopping birth control – what treatments are there?\nThankfully, hair loss caused by contraceptives is usually temporary but may take a few months to improve again after stopping your birth control method. This is because of the length of time it takes for hair cycles to move into growth phase.\nIf the hair loss doesn’t stop after a few months then a medication call minoxidil 2% or Regaine can be used. In the UK this can be bought from the pharmacy or online. Minoxidil helps to move the hair follicles into the growth phase more quickly and may take several months to notice an improvement.\n\nCan the contraceptive pill be good for hair loss?\nThere is no doubt hormones play a vital role in the hair growth cycle and the follicle structure. We’ve looked at the possible effects of progestin, but combined hormonal contraception contains another component: oestrogen. This is also known to impact hair growth and is usually credited with the changes experienced in pregnancy. During this time, hair can be thicker and fuller due to an extension of the growth phase. Combine this with a reduction in hair shedding and an increase in hair diameter and many women will notice more voluminous hair whilst pregnant.\nMenopause can also have an impact on a woman’s hair growth. With reduced levels of oestrogen and a change in oestrogen and androgen production, women may experience female pattern hair loss during this time.\nDoes this mean, then, that the oestrogen in our contraceptives could have beneficial effects on our hair? Possibly. Some women do find their hair appears thicker whilst using combined contraception. Women may also therefore experience some ‘hair loss’ after stopping this birth control method as their hair returns to normal. \nOne The Lowdown user wrote of her experience with Lucette: \n“My skin is clear, and I have not put on any weight which is great. I think this pill tricks your body into thinking it’s pregnant, so makes your hair nice and shiny, boobs grow etc. The down side is the slight loss of sex drive and I would sometimes get upset over nothing.”\nHormonal changes are complex and as such can make pinpointing exact causes difficult. Oestrogen is thought to work by extending the hair growth phase whilst also reducing androgens and thereby their ability to cause hair loss. The combined contraceptive pill is therefore particularly useful for helping treat hair loss and thinning associated with PCOS. \nFor some women, they may take birth control pills to help with excessive hair growth. Find out more about contraception and hirsutism. \n\nMore research is needed into contraception and hair\nUnfortunately, and maybe not surprisingly, this women’s health issue needs more research. The psychological and emotional impacts of hair loss on a woman can be devastating, and the link between hormonal contraception and the hair growth cycle should be explored further.\nDiscovering contraceptive side effects experienced by others can be hugely beneficial in making the right choice for you, and The Lowdown is a great place to access this information. Read reviews submitted by our incredible community or book an appointment with our women’s health service, where our friendly female GPs are available to discuss your concerns and queries. \nIf you’ve noticed changes to your hair whilst using contraception please leave a review!

        "Title": "My experience of removing the IUD (during the pandemic)",
        "Content": "\nDisclaimer: This blog has not been medically reviewed. The views expressed here are those of the writer and do not necessarily reflect those of The Lowdown or our medical team. For information about your contraception or the different methods available please check out our contraception pages.\nAfter almost four years of being friends (and sometimes enemies) with my copper coil (IUD), earlier this year I decided it was time to part ways. The Lowdown has some brilliant articles on the pros and cons of the copper coil if that’s what you’re interested in; this piece is not intended to focus on that aspect of the IUD. However while researching its removal I found very little. I did find out how it was removed technically speaking, but women hadn’t seemed to talk about their actual experience of it so I wanted to share mine.\nBooking an appointment for coil removal\nI started looking for an appointment around March 2021 with the added worry that Coronavirus and my country’s lockdown would make it near impossible, given that it wasn’t a medical emergency. The first hurdle was just finding a place as the clinic where I got my coil fitted had since closed down. I had discussed by intention to remove my coil with my GP who apologetically told me I had to book this independently. I did ask for numbers to call, but again this was something I had to find myself.\nIt seems like a small frustration, but having some solid numbers would have saved me about an hour of my time as I realised googling this wasn’t so simple. A ‘Sexual Health Clinic’ search on the NHS website has a long and promising list of options, but some are only for certain age groups, HIV/AIDS specialists, for pregnancy advice only, closed/restricted due to the pandemic or just didn’t have anyone IUD trained in the first place.\nWhen I managed to find a clinic that was able to help, I understandably had to answer a series of questions over the phone. Most of them were straightforward such as my age and when my coil was inserted. However, I was asked “what contraception are you going to use afterwards?” which struck me as unnecessary and a bit intrusive. It implied that I definitely needed something else – but what if I wanted to become pregnant, had started a same-sex relationship, didn’t plan to be sexually active, etc.? Plus it came with an element of guilt as though I was making the wrong decision for myself and hadn’t fully thought it through. I was also reminded not to have unprotected sex in the 7 days prior to removal, as I could then become pregnant. Important information to have, but again phrased with the assumption pregnancy was to be avoided.\nI was offered a booking just twelve days later! Hairdressing appointments (once possible again) took longer than this so I was very happy. I would be on my period at that time, but I was told that didn’t matter.\n\nThe IUD removal experience\nThe clinic was adhering to Covid regulations which meant I had to arrive alone at a very specific time, get temperature checked, wear a mask and social distance. I was led to a sparse waiting room and then called by the nurse, and didn’t have to wait long at all. The nurse took the time to ask me about my experience on the coil, the reason I wanted it removed and explained the removal procedure – a much better experience than during my phone call – and it really made a difference. The nurse’s empathy and willingness to explain everything made me feel much more relaxed.\nI was directed to remove the bottom half of my clothes and lie on the bed in exactly the same way as getting a smear test – flat on my back near the end of the bed, knees up and feet wide. There was a paper towel to place over my stomach and up my thighs meaning I couldn’t see what was happening. The nurse had left to change some clothes and now returned to sit at the end of the bed. It was a strange sight being attended to while half-naked by a person in full PPE.\nThe minimal technical information I had read about IUD removal played out word for word with a little extra as I was on my period. Using a speculum to hold open the vagina (again, exactly the same way as a smear test) the nurse first removed some of the clumps of blood that was “blocking the view”, then held the two strings that hung from the coil. I was asked to cough and it came out, just like that. I didn’t feel a thing other than the uncomfortable speculum that whole time. I even had to ask if that was it. Once pulled, the T-shaped coil folds up on itself so it can easily come out. Once the speculum was taken out, there was no lingering pain, just the excess lube that had helped the speculum go in. I was given tissue to wipe it up, space to get changed back and I was free to go.\nWARNING: graphic image of an IUD / menstrual blood\nBefore I went, I asked to get a photo of the coil. I had been using it for almost four years but had never seen it, so now was my chance. I’ve proudly attached the photo below (as if it were a cake I baked haha). I was on my period so it was covered in blood, but it’s purely period blood and nothing to do with the coil removal itself. I was also offered some free condoms in case I planned to be sexually active and advice on different contraceptive methods going forwards – but thankfully, this time they weren’t forced on me.\nNote: I was on my period during my coil removal so the blood is purely menstrual – not from the removal process!\nGiven that inserting the IUD was more tedious and (for me) was quite painful, I was bracing for some more pain and had never looked forward to the day when it had to be removed. So I was really surprised at just how easy it was. Maybe the reason there weren’t many detailed accounts of IUD removal was because the technical explanation truly covered it all. Perhaps if you’re dreading the day yours will need to be removed, or you’re putting it off, consider that the worse part (getting it in the first place) is behind you.\n",

        "Title": "Headaches, Migraines and The Pill &#8211; FAQ Guide",
        "Content": "\n✔️ If you think you’ll find this blog informative, make sure to check out our newsletter for more:\n\nHeadaches, migraines and the contraceptive pill…\nA common side effect of the contraceptive pill can be headaches, with up to one third of women experiencing migraines.\nMigraines are a type of primary headache disorder which is suffered each day by around 6 million people in the UK, with an estimated 5-25% being women. In fact from puberty onwards, women are much more prone to migraines than men. This typically continues apart from improvements that can be seen during pregnancy and after the menopause (well there’s got to be some silver linings!). \nThis might provide a clue to the connection that has been identified between hormonal fluctuations and onset of migraine – which is exactly what we’re going to explore here. \nRead on for a deep dive into the symptoms, treatments and contraceptive options for migraines or headaches.\nFirst things first… headache or migraine – what’s the difference? \nOften following an evening of pinot grigio comes the banging head and throbbing temples. But what exactly defines a headache? There are many types of headache, with the most common being tension headaches. Symptoms wise, this can feel like a constant dull ache, which may include neck pain and a feeling of pressure behind the eyes. Real nice. \nHowever, as this is The Lowdown we’re here to focus on headaches, migraines and the pill. Hormonal headaches can be caused by fluctuations in hormones such as oestrogen, throughout the menstrual cycle. If you track three or more cycles and notice these headaches occuring in a regular pattern throughout certain times of the month, chances are it could be triggered by hormonal fluctuations in your menstrual cycle. \nThe NHS defines migraine headaches as a ‘moderate or severe headache felt as a throbbing pain on one side of the head’, although there can be variations on this. Typical associated symptoms include nausea and light and sound sensitivity. You can also think of the throbbing headache as being a symptom of migraine, as the migraine itself can incorporate lots of other things including vision changes, dizziness or nausea. In fact, you might not even experience a headache at all.  \nWhat symptoms can migraines cause?\nThere are a couple of classifications of migraines; migraine with aura and guess what – migraine without aura. Aura is a term used to describe any sort of neurological disturbance, which can appear before the headache or other symptoms of a migraine. Around 10-30% of migraine sufferers experience these symptoms. Often visual, these include flashing lights, coloured spots or zig zags in the field of vision. This can be extremely frightening the first time it happens, but typically subside within an hour. Other neurological symptoms such as weakness on one side, dizziness or vertigo are common too. \nWhy do I get migraines anyway?\nThere are so many alleged triggers for migraines, from chocolate to the weather! Changes in female sex hormones such as oestrogen and progestrone are also linked to the onset of migraines. Sufferers may have noticed that migraine symptoms seem to be triggered at the same time each month, coinciding with different points of the menstrual cycle. Research suggests that this could be due to the drop in oestrogen just before your period and the release of prostaglandins (which cause uterine contractions) at this time. Oh, and naturally, if you then start taking a form of contraception such as the pill, migraine symptoms might change or worsen as those hormones are affected.\nDiagnosing a migraine headache\nIf only it was as easy as a blood test…(said no one, ever). \nTo diagnose migraines, your GP needs to build up a record of frequency, symptoms and patterns associated with onset. During your first appointment, a physical examination may also take place, including blood pressure, vision and coordination tests. Depending on severity and complexity, diagnosis may also involve a referral to a specialist neurologist.\nHeadache diaries to track your menstrual cycle\nYou might want to think about noting down your symptoms, each time you get them. This can really help clinicians to build a picture of how your migraines present, and ensure they can give you the best advice on treatment options. There’s a whole host of useful information that you can begin to track including\n\nTime and date\nLength of attack\nWhat triggered it\nSymptoms\nPainkillers taken (which ones, how much and when)\n\nIt would also be handy to note down where in your menstrual cycle the migraine was, as this can provide insight into whether there is a possible hormonal link.\n\nThe pill, migraines and headaches: let’s discuss…\nCan the contraceptive pill cause headaches and migraines?\nIf you’ve ever read the back of the pill packet, headaches are listed as a side effect, and although in many cases they tend to lessen over time, studies suggest headaches can be one of the leading reasons for pill discontinuation. However our bodies work in mysterious ways and headaches may also decrease on the pill. Different dosages and hormones can also vary in terms of migraine triggers and the type of migraine or headache – so basically a total minefield! You may also experience worsening headaches or migraines during your pill free week on the combined pill, owing to that drop in oestrogen. \nMigraines and the pill – is it safe to take?\nIf you suffer from migraines with aura, then the combined pill (which contains oestrogen and progestogen) is unsuitable, due to a very small increased risk of ischaemic stroke. This risk was identified through studies in the 1970s, when much higher doses of oestrogen were used in pill formulations.\nAlthough there can be differences of opinion in the risk versus benefits – it is important to discuss with your GP if you wish to be prescribed a pill and suffer from migraines. Your doctor will normally advise against the combined pill if you experience aura symptoms with migraines. In some cases it may be fine to be prescribed the combined pill if you experience migraines without aura. \nOf our Lowdown community, 55% experienced headaches and 27% experienced migraines on the combined pill – the highest prevalence amongst all contraception types that we have reviewed. \nCan the mini pill give me headaches or migraines?\nThe mini pill and progestogen only methods of contraception are safe for use for those with migraines both with and without auras, however headaches are still a recognised side effect of progestogen-only contraception. This type of contraception can also be associated with more irregular bleeding – which might be something to think about, depending on your reasons (other than contraception) for taking the pill.\nWhat about headaches with the implant and injection?\nThe injection and implant forms of contraception do not contain oestrogen and are similarly formulated from progestogen so are safe to take if you have experienced migraine with (or without) aura. \n54% of Lowdown reviewers experienced headaches on the mini pill, compared to 28% of reviewers reporting migraines – so no real difference at all when compared to the combined pill. The figures are pretty similar to the injection (48% – headaches / 25% – migraines) and the implant (45% – headaches / 25% – migraines). \n\nHeadache and migraine friendly contraceptive options\nThere are a few options which showed much lower headache and migraine prevalence among The Lowdown community. \nHormonal coil: 33% headache, 17% migraine\nCopper coil: 19% headache, 11% migraine\nNatural cycles: 9% headache, 2% migraine\nMale condom: 0% headache, 0% migraine\nNot to keep banging on about it, but side effects vary hugely and you might find you’re the total opposite to the numbers above. (Oh, and if you are – please let us know by submitting a review as it’s super insightful). \n\nContinuous pill taking – no more migraines!\nNormally with the combined pill, there’s 21 days of taking the pill, followed by a 7 day break.  However, taking your pill non-stop could be the answer to keeping those migraines at bay. Skipping the 7 pill free days, and maintaining oestrogen levels has been shown to be effective in studies (wahoo!) as well as potentially helping with other PMS (pre-menstrual syndrome) symptoms. This could be something to discuss with your GP if you are experiencing headaches or migraines during your pill-free breaks. \nI’m getting migraines / headaches – help!\nWhether or not you’re taking the pill, over the counter painkillers to manage the onset of headaches or migraine could be the answer. However, if this has not been effective your GP will be able to look at other treatments including anti-sickness drugs or medicines called triptans (that specifically target migraines).  \nThere are other recommendations that could keep life more pain-free:\n\nFood glorious food: maintaining your blood sugar levels by eating regular snacks and meals – as skipping meals can trigger migraines\nCatching some zzzz’s: make sure you have a consistent night time routine and enough sleep each night\nCalm and collected: stress is another trigger, so it might be useful to develop an exercise routine or mindfulness strategies such as yoga.\n\n\n\n\nEmma is a Pharmacology & Physiology graduate with a huge passion for women’s health.

        "Title": "COVID-19, the vaccine, fertility and periods &#8211; your questions answered",
        "Content": "\nWhat’s the lowdown?\n\n\n \nRead on to discover more about the facts and research currently being done on the COVID-19 vaccine and fertility, as well as the COVID-19 vaccine and periods … and to hear some of our user’s own experiences!\nCOVID-19 vaccine and fertility\nDoes the COVID-19 vaccine affect fertility?\nThe answer to this question from the experts is a resounding no. \nThe President of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, Edward Morris, says “there’s absolutely no scientific evidence to suggest that any of the COVID-19 vaccines affects fertility, for men or women, or any plausible biological reason that it would”. \nMost young women of childbearing age will have had 23 vaccinations by the age of 20 and there is no effect on fertility, so why should the COVID-19 vaccines be different?\nWhere did the rumour come from?\nEarly conspiracy theories circulated online suggested that the COVID-19 vaccine could disrupt the formation of the placenta and therefore affect fertility. A research group has addressed this rumour and its potential origins. \nWe know the COVID-19 vaccines target the “spike protein” found on the outside of the COVID-19 virus. By neutralising this spike protein, the virus is unable to enter our cells to replicate and cause further infection.\nThe anti-vaxxer community claims there is an alleged similarity between the spike protein and a protein called syncytin-1 that embryos need to form a placenta. Their concerns are that this similarity causes the body to form an immune response against the placenta as well as the COVID-19 spike proteins.\nThe diagram below shows the amino-acid sequence (which is basically a map) of each protein, these have been taken from the original study paper itself (doi:10.3390/biology10030238). The similarity between them is highlighted in yellow.\n1. Human Syncytin-1 Protein\n\n2. COVID-19 Spike Protein COVID-19 Spike Protein\nKloc M, Uosef A, Kubiak JZ, Ghobrial RM. Exaptation of Retroviral Syncytin for Development of Syncytialized Placenta, Its Limited Homology to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein and Arguments against Disturbing Narrative in the Context of COVID-19 Vaccination. Biology (Basel). 2021;10(3):238. Published 2021 Mar 19. doi:10.3390/biology10030238\nAs you can see……there really isn’t much similarity. It is likely that multiple proteins in the body would have this small identical sequence to the COVID-19 vaccine and there is no evidence of an immune response against other proteins. And now there is actual science completely disproving this theory (doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.23.21257686).\nWhat research has been conducted to date?\nResearch groups have started where they usually do, in rats. \nIn one lab study, female rats were injected with the full adult dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine three weeks before being introduced to some lovely male rats. 95% of the rats fell pregnant after, quite amazingly, three days. \nThis is encouraging as animal and rat studies are considered the best tools available to predict potential problems in humans. It is difficult to design clinical trials looking at fertility in humans. \nIt is rather unethical to force human women to get pregnant after their vaccinations. So instead, we have to look at data in real time as it happens, which thankfully NHS England have provided us with.\nDr Vicki Male, reproductive immunologist at Imperial College London reported to NHS England that “In the clinical trials, participants were asked to use reliable contraception, but nevertheless, 57 of them became pregnant by accident. These pregnancies occurred equally in the vaccinated, and the unvaccinated groups, telling us that being vaccinated doesn’t reduce your chances of getting pregnant”. These women were all meant to be using reliable contraception but obviously hadn’t found The Lowdown yet… \nDr Male adds “In the US, at the end of March, 4804 post-vaccination pregnancies have been reported to the CDC although this is going to be an underestimate of the global total, because this is only Americans”. \nIn men, studies have looked at the quality of sperm before and after vaccination with the Pfizer vaccine, and vaccination makes no difference to the quality of your sperm. However, infection with COVID-19 can have a negative effect on this. \nFinally, the COVID-19 vaccines are not known to cause any harm to, or affect the success of fertility treatments. Equal numbers of pregnancies have been counted in IVF cycles in both vaccinated and unvaccinated couples. \nNot only is there no scientific evidence linking the COVID-19 vaccines with fertility problems, the research so far is very reassuring and provides evidence to the contrary.\nWhat do I do if I have concerns about the vaccine and fertility?\nWe advise you to avoid reading stories on social media that don’t have scientific references to support their claims. \nWe would suggest searching for information from reliable sources including the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecologists, the Royal College of Midwives, or the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in the USA. \nIf you feel you need to speak to a healthcare professional about fertility concerns, speak to your GP or one of The Lowdown women’s health team.  Remember that most couples don’t get pregnant in the first month of trying to conceive, but 85% of couples do within a year.\n\nCOVID-19 infection and periods\nDoes having COVID impact your periods?\nMany women have been reporting changes to their periods following infection with COVID-19. This is of course only women who knew they had COVID-19, as one third of women still have absolutely no symptoms despite being infected and may therefore not get tested. \nOne Lowdown user reports:\n“Covid has completely changed my period. From how long it lasts, to the intensity of my cramps (mine have lessened thankfully), to the colour. Some months I’m 3-5 days early, others I’m 3-5 days late, occasionally on time. I thought as I continued to improve in my other long-hauler symptoms, this would balance out as well, but it has not. It’s almost as if I’m starting my period for the first time all over again.”\nMenstrual irregularities in 237 women (of child bearing age) who had confirmed COVID-19 have been investigated by scientists in China. 20% of these women reported lighter periods, while 5% experienced heavier periods. One fifth of women experienced longer cycles, and this occurred in women with both mild or severe COVID-19 infection.\nOn follow up, 99% of the women’s menstrual changes had returned to normal within 2 months, so any changes are likely to be short lived. One 44 year old woman didn’t have a period for 4 months after COVID-19, but we don’t yet know whether age will have an impact on these changes. The length between periods also changes in the perimenopause (the time around and leading up to the menopause).\nIt is really important to remember that changes in the menstrual cycle are common after any severe illness and are related to the stress the body is under. However, clearly more research is needed to understand the true effects of COVID-19 on our periods.\nCOVID-19 vaccine and periods\nDoes having the COVID-19 vaccine impact your periods?\nNo previous vaccination has had as much media interest as the COVID-19 vaccines. Side effects and adverse reactions are identified by patients and healthcare professionals who report them via the MHRA’s Yellow Card scheme.\nDue to the intense media scrutiny of the world wide COVID-19 vaccination programme, more women may be anticipating and therefore noticing menstrual irregularities, which are normally very common. Menstrual irregularities have also been reported after other widely used vaccinations including HPV (human papillomavirus) and flu.\nSome women have reported heavier and more frequent bleeding after the vaccination. This seems to be more common with the AstraZeneca vaccine than with the Pfizer vaccine. There are plausible reasons why there may be a link. \nA potential hypothesis for this is that an autoimmune reaction against platelets (now listed as a common side effect of the COVID-19 AstraZeneca vaccination) causes heavier bleeding. This is because platelets are needed to clot our blood, and lower platelets could mean heavier bleeding.\nDr Pat O’Brien, Vice President at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said:\n“It’s important to remember these side effects are mild and should not deter women from having the vaccine when they are called. Many women will experience a temporary change in their periods from time to time during their lives. And right now, many women in their 30s are having the COVID vaccine. So it seems inevitable that in some women these two events will coincide by chance. If, however, these changes persist, or you have any new vaginal bleeding after the menopause, you should see your doctor.\nWe also want to stress that these perceived changes in menstrual cycle after having the COVID-19 vaccine should not be confused with an impact on fertility and the ability to have children. There is no evidence to suggest that COVID-19 vaccines will affect fertility.”\nSo… what next?\nWe believe the lack of information on this topic highlights the gender bias in clinical research trials towards men over women. We’d like to see menstrual irregularities investigated as part of clinical trials so women can be made aware of potential side effects, like changes to bleeding patterns, and so they can be prepared rather than anxious or worried. \nIf we have learnt anything from The Lowdown community it is that women and their periods should not be ignored! Women would much rather be well-informed and empowered to anticipate and manage the side effects of life-saving vaccines, just like we are doing with contraceptive methods here at The Lowdown. \nThe Lowdown are planning to conduct our own poll of our 20,000+ users for more stories about periods and the COVID-19 vaccination. Keep an eye on our Instagram feed for more information, and please let us know if and how your periods have been affected!\nOne of The Lowdown’s fab Clinical Directors, Dr Frances Yarlett MBBCh (Hons) BSc (Hons) MRCP (2016) MRCGP DFSRH completed her medical training from Cardiff University in 2013. She is currently working as a salaried GP partner in Sheffield with an interest in complex medical patients and women’s health. Fran is really passionate about patient choice and wants to empower women to take control of their bodies and contraception needs.\n",

        "Title": "Changing your contraception: how to switch methods",
        "Content": "\nUsing contraception can be like a long-term relationship; with so many different options, it’s only natural to be curious about what else might be out there. There is a wide array of available methods designed to meet the needs of different women.\nEvery woman is different and just because your contraception may be working doesn’t necessarily mean it’s working for you.\nWhy should you change contraception?\nThere are a number of reasons why someone might decide to try a new form of contraception. \nSide effects\nSome women may experience adverse side effects whilst using a specific form of contraception. These adverse symptoms may be physical or emotional and typically include acne, weight gain, headaches, breast tenderness, irregular bleeding, painful periods, depressed or anxious mood, or other complaints. \nReliability\nWomen may also make a switch for reasons of reliability, ease of use, or control of bleeding patterns. For example, a woman may decide to switch to an IUS (also known as the intrauterine system or hormonal coil) if she finds herself forgetting to take the pill some days. But just to be clear, there is absolutely no necessity to change your form of contraception if you are happy with it or you think the benefits outweigh any downsides. \nOne thing to note is that it usually takes your body 3 to 6 months to adjust to a new method of contraception. For some women this adjustment can be accompanied by uncomfortable side effects, similar to those above. If you’re still experiencing unwanted or unmanageable side effects after this amount of time, it may be time to speak to your healthcare provider about how to manage these or consider making a switch. And, of course, If you do experience any side-effects you are concerned about before the 3 to 6 month mark, reach out to your healthcare provider.\nIf you have read this far and are still interested in potentially trying out a new form of contraception, here is your go-to guide for what to expect when switching contraception.\nWhat to consider when changing contraception\nThere are some logistics to consider when switching your form of contraception from one method to another. Timing is a key factor and the reality is it may take some time to actually make the switch. Most contraception requires a prescription, acquired either during a visit to your GP or from a sexual health clinic, both of which may require an appointment.\n\n \n\nThe impact of Covid\nThe coronavirus pandemic has made things even more difficult. You may be thinking “you’re telling me this virus is affecting my sexual health too?!” Unfortunately, it may be. If you’re considering switching, you may need to be proactive and plan ahead. Restrictions around face-to-face appointments may delay your access to different forms of contraception which require an in-person fitting or removal, such as an IUS or the implant.\nData from NHS digital showed that between April and September 2020 44% of sexual health clinic appointments were non-face to face compared to only 3% the year before, and fewer women were getting methods such as the coils, implant or injection. \nCheck with your provider if virtual appointments are an option. If certain clinical measurements, such as blood pressure and weight, are up to date and stable, it may be possible to issue an electronic prescription to your pharmacy for the combined pill, patch or ring. Switching brands of the combined pill may also therefore be possible following a virtual appointment. If a face-to-face consultation is necessary you may be invited for one. If this is not possible, you may be offered an alternative, such as the progestogen-only pills, until you are able to make an appointment with your provider in person. You can buy mini pills including Hana, Aizea, Cerazette and more a the Lowdown (you’ll need to fill in a few questions first!). \nBeginning most forms of contraception, such as the pill or the patch, do not require any downtime after. However, an IUS or the implant requires a physical insertion or placement, which may be accompanied by some immediate short-term side effects and is a factor to consider when planning your switch. For IUS insertion, the most common immediate side effect is uterine cramping, with around 65% of our reviewers reporting pain. Similarly, tenderness or slight bruising has been reported following insertion of the implant. Every woman will have a different experience and it is important to listen to your body and do what feels best for you, even if this means taking the rest of the day a little more slowly than usual.\nHow to switch from one method of contraception to another\nWhen considering making a switch, we recommend speaking to your healthcare provider. These switches are all about timing and trying to figure out how best to switch between different methods can be confusing.\nThere are, indeed, correct ways to transition from one method of contraception to another, (depending on which methods you want to switch between and how reliably you’ve been using them) and doing so incorrectly may increase your risk for unplanned pregnancy so it’s best to discuss this with a healthcare professional.\nHow long does it take to adjust to a new contraception? \nFor most switches, barrier methods are used to maintain contraceptive cover to protect a woman from unintended pregnancy. This is because your new contraception may need some time to be able to provide its full protective effects. Most commonly this means using condoms during sex after beginning your new form of contraception, until you can rely on it for contraceptive cover.\nEnsuring you use your existing contraception method correctly and consistently before you switch is also important. For example, there is no need for extra protection when switching to a new brand of pill immediately after completing the entirety of the old pack, with no gaps in between. However, when switching from the combined pill to an IUS you may be advised you need to use extra protection such as condoms for 7 days after the IUS is fitted, depending on where in your pill pack you are.\nYou should reach out to either your GP or your local sexual health clinic to help guide you on your contraception-changing journey or chat to one of The Lowdown’s specialist doctors for contraception advice. \nContraception is still available free on the NHS, however, remember that COVID-19 restrictions may delay the transition, so speak to your healthcare provider about your options.\n  \nErin is an Associate Account Executive at BGB Group in New York City.

        "Content": "\nOn the 8th March 2021, the UK Government announced they were going to create their very first Women’s Health Strategy!\nThey launched a 14 call for evidence to help inform the priorities, content and actions that the strategy should focus on. The idea was to help them better understand women’s experiences of health, and the health and care system. And to help ensure they were listening to women as they set out a ‘ambitious and positive new agenda on women’s health, with women’s voices at the centre.’\nThe Government welcomed written submissions from individuals or organisations who have expertise in women’s health, such as researchers and third-sector organisations. Naturally, The Lowdown were incredibly excited to contribute, and share our thoughts on how reproductive and sexual healthcare needs to be improved 🔥\nWe posted a survey on our Instagram account @Get.the.lowdown and were blown away by the response. Our survey was widely shared and we received over 2,000 responses! The results make for a fascinating and depressing read.\nYou can download a full copy of the survey results and report we submitted to the Government below 👇\n————-\nThe Lowdown’s Women’s Health Strategy response (1)\n————-\nIf you’d like to find out more about our results, or have any feedback for us on our report – please don’t hesitate to get in touch.

        "Title": "IUS/IUD coil fitting: what to expect",
        "Content": "\nIf this blog sounds interesting to you, make sure to check out our newsletter for more!\n\nIf you have decided that the coil is the right contraception for you, then it may feel like there is a minefield of information when it comes to knowing what to expect from a copper or hormonal coil fitting. \nFirst thing’s first, brush up on the difference between the copper coil (IUD) and the hormonal coil (aka hormonal IUD or IUS) in our complete guide.\nWhat to know before your coil fitting\nWhere can I get the coil fitted near me?\nCoils are available from contraception clinics, some GP practices and sexual health clinics. This sexual health service locator can help you find where your closest service is to have the coil fitted.  \nWhen can I get my coil fitted?\nIf you are having the coil fitted, then many clinics will ask you to avoid sex from the first day of your last period (or for 3 weeks before if you’re not having regular periods) until the fitting and do a pregnancy test on the day to ensure there is no risk of pregnancy. This may not be necessary if you are using another form of contraception consistently and reliably but clinics may have their own protocols and should be able to advise you beforehand.  Both the copper and hormonal coil can be fitted at any time during your menstrual cycle. \nCan I have a coil fitted when pregnant?\nNo you cannot have a coil fitted when pregnant as you are at risk of miscarriage.  \nHow long after coil fitting are you protected from pregnancy?\nIf a hormonal coil is fitted in the first five days of your menstrual cycle you will be immediately protected from pregnancy. But if it is fitted at any other time in your cycle, then you will be advised to use another form of contraception such as condoms, or abstain from sex for seven days after fitting. If you switched from another contraceptive method, whether you need to use condoms for seven days after fitting will depend on the type of contraception you were using, if you were using it reliably, and if you’ve had sex in the last seven days, so discuss this with your healthcare professional. You may also find our blog on changing your contraception helpful. \nThe copper coil is effective at preventing pregnancy straight after it is fitted.\nCan I have the coil fitted as a form of emergency contraception?\nThe copper coil can work as a form of emergency contraception, meaning it can be fitted after sex to prevent pregnancy. In fact it is the most effective method of emergency contraception, more effective than the morning after pill.  The copper coil can be inserted up to five days after sex, or up to five days after the earliest time you could have ovulated (your healthcare professional can work this out with you). \nCan I ask for pain relief for my coil fitting?\nYes. Everyone should be offered pain relief during a coil fitting and the different options can be discussed with your clinician.\nOptions include:\n\nLocal anaesthetic spray which is applied to the cervix (the neck of the womb through which the coil is fitted) before the coil is inserted. It takes 3 minutes to work so there’s a slight delay or a chance to talk about the weather\nLocal anaesthetic cream (often called by brand name EMLA) can also be used on the cervix but takes 7 minutes to work so is a slightly longer delay – which may increase your nerves\nLocal anaesthetic injections can be placed in or around the cervix to reduce pain. However, having the injections themselves can be uncomfortable\nYou may be advised to take simple painkillers such a paracetamol or ibuprofen before and after the fitting which can also ease discomfort\n“Vocal local” is a phrase coined by the medical profession meaning that a relaxed environment with a chatty assistant to distract you from the procedure is also useful as a pain relief. This is why it is so important that you feel comfortable, in control and trust the person doing your procedure – as this has the ability to reduce the discomfort you may feel.\n\nThere has been lots of discussion in the media around the issue of pain relief offered during coil fittings. We at The Lowdown want women to know our data shows the hormonal and copper coils have the highest overall satisfaction rating of any method on our site (6,500+ reviews and counting) and once it’s fitted 54-61% of women report saying the coils are ‘very good’ or ‘excellent’ – which is over double the proportion that state that for the combined pill or mini pill.\n\nFor years The Lowdown have been telling women about the wonders of sprays, gels and anaesthetic injections – and trying to educate them that they can ask for these things during their appointment.\nAn old survey of UK clinicians reported that approximately one-quarter of health professionals who undertook the survey routinely used local anaesthetic for coil insertion, with around one-quarter of health professionals never, or rarely, offering it, and the remainder doing so sometimes. Following the media attention, recent guidance has changed.\nGuidelines from the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Health (last updated in 2023) now advise that EVERYBODY having a coil insertion should be offered pain relief, so don’t be afraid to advocate for yourself. \nCan I get the coil fitted on my period?\nYes, the coil can be fitted any time during your menstrual cycle. \nCan I have a coil fitted with thrush?\nYes, you can have a coil fitted if you have thrush. \nPreparing for your coil fitting\nPre-fit consultation\nBefore having the coil fitted, it’s important that you have a pre-fit consultation, this will help to determine which type of coil is suitable for you, or if you are changing the type of coil you currently have. This may be on the same day as your fitting or beforehand. This will be a chance for your doctor to describe the differences between the copper and hormonal coils and if there is a more suitable one for your medical history and requirements. This is also a great chance to voice any concerns you may have and ask any questions.  At this point you may be asked to have STI (sexually transmitted infection) screening for infections such as chlamydia.  You can have an STI and be symptomless. If you have a coil fitted when you have an STI this may lead to a pelvic infection which can be dangerous and cause symptoms such as pain, bleeding and a fever. If an STI is picked up on screening you will be offered treatment and your coil fitting can be scheduled once treatment is complete.  \nOn the day of your coil fitting\nHow to prepare on the day of your coil fitting?\nOn the day of your coil fitting some clinics recommend you take a painkiller about an hour before you are due to have the coil fitted. Despite being widely advised, there is no evidence it significantly helps reduce pain during insertion. It may however help to reduce pain or discomfort experienced after the insertion. Non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen may be best for this. Similarly, when The Lowdown interviewed Professor Guillebaud, he recommended using Naproxen, which you may be able to get on prescription beforehand.\nIt is recommended that you have your breakfast or lunch before the appointment as you would normally. Sometimes after the coil fitting you may feel nauseous, lightheaded or faint, and this can feel worse if you’ve not eaten.  \nWhat do you wear to a coil fitting?\nWe would recommend wearing loose, comfortable clothes to the fitting that are easy to change in and out of.\nWhat to expect at your coil fitting appointment\nBefore your coil is fitted, your GP or healthcare professional will have a short consultation with you and may ask you to do a pregnancy test. Often there will be an assistant in the room to help your doctor or nurse make sure they have everything they need, and to chat with you and help you during the procedure. \nYour doctor or nurse will then check your vagina to see the size and position of your womb, and use a speculum to see the cervix (the neck of the womb at the top of the vagina).  Local anaesthetic can be used at this point to help numb the cervix and make the coil fitting procedure less uncomfortable. During this time your vagina will be held open using the speculum. Once the local anaesthetic has had time to work, your doctor or nurse will use an instrument to hold the cervix so they can measure the length of the womb, and following this  the coil can be inserted into the womb. This may be uncomfortable but should only last a short time.  The tube used to insert the coil is removed and the coil is left in place. The coil has two threads that hang through the neck of the womb into the vagina. Your doctor or nurse may trim these for comfort. \nIt is important to be aware that all procedures like this can trigger what is known medically as a ‘vasovagal response’. This means your heart rate and blood pressure drop and you may feel nauseous, light-headed and even faint. If you feel like this, your doctor or nurse may check your heart rate and blood pressure. These symptoms don’t last long and your healthcare professional will be trained in how to manage this.\nCheck out The Lowdown’s interview on our Instagram Stories with Professor John Guillebaud (Emeritus Professor of Family Planning and Reproductive Health at University College London) on his advice on having a coil fitted.\nIt might help for you to read some reviews at The Lowdown, from people like you, who have gone through the same procedure you’re waiting for. \nYou can also listen to the Hormonal IUS episode of our podcast ‘The Lowdown on contraception where we speak to a GP who fits coils regularly and a Lowdown user who has a Mirena coil.\nOur very own Dr Fran also discusses her experience of having the mirena coil fitting in our Sunday Surgery on Instagram Stories.\n\nAfter your coil fitting\nPain after coil fitting, is this normal? \nHaving pain after your coil fitting is normal. Some women may experience cramping like pains, which are similar to as if you are on your period. You can take painkillers before having the coil fitted, or afterwards to ease any associated discomfort. \nHow long does the pain after a coil fitting last?\nIt is perfectly normal to have some cramping that lasts a few hours after the coil has been inserted. You may experience some mild cramping pain that is on and off in the first few weeks after having the coil inserted. \nSevere pain after coil fitting\nIf you have severe pain after having your coil fitted, or a pain that gets worse or lasts longer than three days then contact your GP or sexual health clinic immediately. \nHow do I know if the coil is fitted correctly?\nAt your coil fitting appointment the health professional will teach you how to feel if the coil is fitted correctly. The coil has two thin threads that will hang down through the neck of the womb into the top of your vagina. If you feel for these threads, you can feel that it is in place. It’s advised to check this regularly, i.e once a month after your period or at regular intervals if not experiencing monthly periods.  If your bleeding pattern changes from what might be expected or a period is missed when using the copper coil, you should consider doing a pregnancy test and returning to your healthcare professional to have your coil checked. You can buy 2 Clearblue tests from Amazon (affiliate link).\nWhat to do if my coil has moved?\nIf you can’t feel the two threads from your coil and you think it may have moved, then you should see a GP or nurse as soon as possible. If the coil has moved then you may not be protected from pregnancy so it is recommended that you use additional contraception such as condoms until the health professional has checked that the coil is back in place. \nHow long after the coil fitting can I exercise?\nThe NHS recommends that you wait up to 48 hours before exercising after having a coil fitted. \nSex after coil fitting – How long should I wait?\nYou should avoid having sex after a coil is inserted for 24 hours, to help the coil to settle. If the hormonal coil was fitted after day five of your menstrual cycle you will also need to use extra protection, such as condoms for seven days. \n\nHow long after having the coil fitted can I wear a tampon?\nThe advice on how long to wait before using a tampon after having a coil fitted varies and is based on reducing the risk of infection. It is sensible to avoid tampons for the first 24 to 48 hours and use sanitary towels for bleeding during this time, although some NHS clinics recommend avoiding tampons for the first 4 weeks after fitting. \nCan you use a menstrual cup after having a coil fitted?\nThe Mooncup manufacturer states that whilst many coil users are able to easily use a menstrual cup alongside their coil, there have been some cases when the coil has been dislodged. They recommend to ensure that you keep checking for the strings of the coils after each period, and to discuss with a medical professional if you think the coil has moved. \nBleeding after copper coil / IUD fitting \nYou may find that you bleed for a few days after a copper coil/IUD fitting.  It is normal to have light bleeding after a coil insertion, but it’s recommended to speak to  your doctor if you have heavy bleeding or worsening pain. \nWhat to expect from your periods with a copper coil or hormonal coil\nYou may find that after having a coil fitted that your periods change and you may also find that you get spotting that occurs in between periods. 51% of our contraceptive reviewers (data retrieved 21.05.24) stated that the copper coil gave them heavier periods, with 39% of The Lowdown reviewers stating that the hormonal coil stopped their periods. \nWhat are the risks of having a coil fitted?\n\nThere is a small risk of getting an infection after the coil is fitted. Seek medical advice if you have pain in your tummy, a high temperature or unusual discharge.\nThere is a risk that your body may expel the coil (1 in 20 cases). This occurs more commonly within the first few weeks of the coil being fitted. It is important you know how to check your coil is in place and if you can’t feel your threads use condoms and return to where your coil was fitted for it to be checked. \nIn very rare cases (1 in 1000 cases) the coil may perforate the uterine wall. This is very unlikely if you have an experienced doctor or nurse fit your coil, but if you have pain or cannot feel the threads make sure you seek medical advice. \n\nWhat are the side effects of having a coil fitted?\nCopper coil\n\nYour periods may become heavier, longer or more painful (63% of The Lowdown copper coil reviews stated heavier periods as a side effect)\nPeriod like cramps are another common side effect (79% of our copper coil reviewers had period like cramps varying in severity from “a bit” to “a lot”)\n\nHormonal coil\n\nYour periods may stop or you may have spotting in between periods\nMood swings\nBreast tenderness\nSkin problems\n28% of our hormonal coil reviewers stated loss of sex drive as a side effect (data retrieved 07.06.2023), 11% had an increased sex drive, whilst 47% had no change.\n\nTo find out the experiences of our reviewers of the copper coil and hormonal coil then read our IUD / copper coil reviews and IUS / hormonal coil reviews.

        "Title": "How the current healthcare system is failing women when it comes to their contraception",
        "Content": "\nWelcome – I’m Alice 👋\nI set up The Lowdown to help women sort out their contraception in 2019. We’ve collected over 5,000 real-person reviews on every method and brand in the UK – and thousands of women come to us every day.\nOur mission is to make contraception easier to choose, access and use for the 1 billion people who need it worldwide. We have big plans to use our unique dataset and growing community to transform this massively underserved area of women’s health. 🚀\nOver the last 5 years I’ve spoken to thousands of women about their contraception, and want to share some of what I’ve learnt in the hope to educate more people about what a mess it is, and why we desperately need change.\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry only funnels 2% of it’s annual revenue from contraceptives back into research and development 💰\nLet’s start off with the underlying problem: The contraceptive methods we have available to us simply aren’t good enough.\nThe Pharma industry does not want to invest more time and money into developing new ways to stop people from getting pregnant. The reasons behind this are complicated – but from what I’ve learnt, it’s a combination of things that are all to do with money:\n\nContraceptives are expensive and difficult to develop, trial and get regulated: It’s a risky business giving a healthy person a drug\nPharmas will never be able to sell contraceptives for the same price as life saving cancer drugs\nThey’re also scared about getting sued (lots of legal disputes involving contraceptives in the 80’s and 90’s)\nPharma have (unfounded) fears that any new male methods will erode the established female contraceptive market.\nThere’s a general perception that we have ‘enough’ options.\n\n\nAround 80% of us get unwanted side effects 🤷‍♀️\nSadly the impact of this lack of investment into contraception falls mainly on women.\nIn case you have been living on the moon since the 60’s: Contraception causes millions of people with vaginas unwanted side effects. These range from the irritating (breakthrough bleeding, headaches) to wellbeing impacting (mood changes, reduced sex drive) to life threatening (blood clots, increased risk of breast cancer). \nA wide range of clinical evidence points to the fact that 20-30% of us are dissatisfied with our contraception, and concerns about side effects are the number one reason why Western women stop using their method. Our research shows over half of women have had trouble trying to find a method that suits them. It’s a journey! \nThere are obviously fantastic benefits to contraception. But the pervasive narrative seems to be that we simply have to brush aside the bad bits and pay this price to not get pregnant. We’re riding a generational wave of women demanding more for their health, and I hope as part of that we can all have a more nuanced conversation about contraception. It can be both good and bad, and acknowledging this does not always result in women throwing out their contraception, causing unintended pregnancies. \n\nGetting good medical advice is difficult and takes time ⏰\nI have no idea how a GP or practice nurse can fit a proper contraception consultation into a 10 minute appointment. There are so many questions and options to run through, that it’s no surprise that 33% of Lowdown users don’t feel they have time during their appointment to discuss everything they want to with their Doctor.\nWhen we launched a virtual Ask a Doctor service we extended our appointment slots from 15 to 20 minutes, and they still can overrun, even without our Doctors writing prescriptions or dealing with multiple health concerns. \nYou’d never choose your mortgage in 10 minutes. And given that most women use contraception for longer than 30 years, we all need to work together to devise innovative but reliable ways to impart this complicated information to them – before, during or after appointments. The technology is out there, but given the personal and emotional nature of these decisions, many women will still want and need to have a conversation with a real human being. And it’s down to us to innovate on how this is delivered. \n\nWomen don’t feel listened to 👂\nThis is a big one. And I think it happens for a few reasons.\nOn one hand we have an incredibly busy healthcare professional who is trying to make sure they give a woman the best possible care, in a very short space of time. They need to ensure access to suitable, safe and reliable contraception but don’t have access to huge amount of reliable (or accepted) gold standard research linking contraception to non-threatening side effects like mood, sex drive, skin and other changes – and more importantly, what to do about managing these side effects.\nOn the other hand we have a woman who doesn’t want to get pregnant – but at a certain point, for some women, the side effects and repeated ‘trial and error’ or switching between methods and brands make them so miserable, they start to need help. Some of these side effects may not all be clinically proven, but for many women she feels like her contraception is impacting her in this way. And we need to respect that. \nI recognise that Doctors are disempowered, and faced with trying to make the best of a bad situation. And I think that often results in women not feeling listened to or in control. At The Lowdown we’ve realised that helping women feel listened to and understood, can sometimes be the treatment they’re looking for. \n\nWomen are starting to turn their back on hormones 🧬\nYou may have seen the stats showing the fall in use of oral contraceptives, and increase in LARC uptake over the last 10 years. The Hormonal IUS is the highest rated method of contraception at The Lowdown, with 60% of reviewers rating it ‘Very good’ or ‘Excellent’. \nBut there is also a much more impactful trend of women wanting to ‘free’ themselves from hormonal contraception, and not ‘liking the thought of hormones inside them’. This has picked up pace in the last 18 months, especially due to the multiple think pieces in the press last year to mark the 60th anniversary of the contraceptive pill. \nWhen it comes to contraceptive technology, I think we should all be aware that we’re heading well into the Trough of Disillusionment:\n\nThis means that investment will only continue if the surviving providers improve their products. And as per my first point, they’re not doing that.\nWhen we tell our users about the next generation of contraceptive products appearing, like the (now delayed) Ballerine IUB, we receive an overwhelming response. \n\n \n\nWomen want to talk, so it’s our job to connect them 💬\nThis is the crux of The Lowdown’s success, and something that I know lots of healthcare professionals get frustrated about; women arriving in clinics filled with misinformation or hearsay from their girlfriends. \n70% of women turn to Google when they have a problem or question about their contraception, and there are over half a million searches on this topic in the UK alone every month. I agree with the RCOG Better for women report that ‘the NHS website should become the world’s best source of information for girls, women and clinicians’, but we also need to look at where these women hang out and increasingly get their health advice – platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok. \nThis is why I set up The Lowdown – because I recognised that we need to challenge the way we think about women managing their health, and create a safe non-medical space where women feel supported and listened to. \n\nIf you’d like to find out more about us and our findings or plans, or have any feedback for me on how we can do better – please don’t hesitate to get in touch alice@thelowdown.com\n\nAs you’re here – checkout our reviews, read about the different types of contraception – or follow us @Get.the.lowdown\n  \nAlice set up The Lowdown in 2019 with a mission to help transform the minefield that is  contraception. She’s spent the last four years talking to thousands of women about this problem – and leads on the delivery of our product, brand and overall proposition.\n",

Women with COVID-19 disease are also 2-3 times more likely to have their babies early than women without COVID-19.\n\nPregnant women with underlying clinical conditions are at even higher risk of suffering serious complications from COVID-19.\nWhich vaccines are available to pregnant women?\nPregnant women are being offered the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, because they’ve been more widely used during pregnancy in other countries.\n\nMore than 90,000 pregnant women have been vaccinated in the United States with these vaccines,  with no specific concerns raised about safety so far.\n\nNone of the vaccines available in England contain live coronavirus, so they cannot infect you or your baby.\n\nThere is no evidence so far to suggest that any COVID-19 vaccines used in England are unsafe for pregnant women, and there is no evidence that they will cause any problems for women wanting to become pregnant in the future.\nI’m pregnant and have already had my first dose of AstraZeneca vaccine. Should I have my second dose?\nIt is recommended that women receive the same vaccine for both doses.\n\nIf you have already received a first dose of AstraZeneca vaccine and didn’t experience any serious side effects, then you should continue to receive a second dose.  Serious side effects from this vaccine are thankfully very rare and even less likely in the second dose.\nI’m breastfeeding, can I have the vaccine?\nIf you are breastfeeding, you can receive any of the COVID-19 vaccines available. You do not need to stop breastfeeding when you get a vaccine. None of the vaccines contain virus that can reproduce inside your body or spread to your breastmilk. You should be reassured that by receiving the vaccine, you are protecting yourself while continuing to provide your baby with the benefits of breastfeeding.\nWill the vaccine give me or my baby Covid-19?\nYou cannot get Covid-19 from the vaccines because they do not contain live coronavirus. There are no additional ingredients that are harmful to pregnant women or their babies in the vaccine.\nCan I try for a baby after being vaccinated?\nIf you are offered the vaccine while trying to conceive, this should not affect your decision about vaccination. There’s no need to avoid pregnancy after vaccination.\n\nThere is no evidence that the vaccines cause problems with fertility, or that they will cause any problems for women wanting to become pregnant now or in the future\nWhere can I find more information?\nFor more information, Public Health England have produced a helpful guide to COVID-19 vaccination for all women of childbearing age. This is available on their website.\n\nThe Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology and the Royal College of Midwives have also produced a decision aid here to help you decide whether to receive vaccination.\n\n\n\n",

        "Title": "A Guide to Androgens",
        "Content": "\nWhat are Androgens?\nAndrogens are a group of sex hormones generally associated with men, although some are also found naturally in women’s bodies in lower concentrations. Testosterone is the main hormone in this group.High levels of androgenic hormones in women can cause a hormonal imbalance, which can lead to a number of problems, such as acne, excess body hair and balding. These can also be symptoms of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), which is associated with high levels of androgens, as well as irregular periods and problems with insulin sensitivity.There is actually no androgenic progesterone, as natural progesterone (the kind that our bodies make) is anti-androgenic. There are no added androgenic effects of progesterone in your body, unless you are using birth control.\nHow are androgens related to my contraception?\nAll hormonal methods of contraception contain progestins, which is the word to describe synthetic forms of progesterone. Some methods, known as ‘combined’ methods, contain progestin in combination with oestrogen.Because they are similar to testosterone, some progestins can bind with the androgen receptors in our cells and either block or activate them. Androgenic progestin side effects include oily acne-prone skin, excessive hair growth (on places such as the face and the chest) and hair loss from the head.The most recent generations of progestins have been developed in an attempt to create progestins that do not have an androgenic effect1.  \nAndrogenic v anti-androgen birth control\nProgestins can be described as ‘androgenic’ or ‘anti-androgenic’ – but the reality is that they all fall somewhere between the two extremes. They can impact different side effects a person experiences on the type of birth control. Androgenic pill side effects may include acne, depression, hair growth or loss, whereas anti-androgenic pills may affect sex drive or cause nausea or headaches due to the relevant dominance of the oestrogen. The table below summarises how ‘androgenic’ the progestins used in contraception are…\n\n\n\nWe should treat this table with some caution. Much of the information available on androgenic activity is extrapolated from data obtained from experiments on rats and rabbits. It is also quite old. Much of the data is not for pre-menopausal women (users of contraception) as the focus in studies was on hormone therapy used to manage symptoms of the menopause. It is also hugely important to be aware that that the androgenic activity of different progestins changes according to individual, sex, whether or not the progestin is taken with an oestrogen and even the type of cell. Basically, it’s not very straightforward and knowing how this information affects you and your contraception is complex to say the least. If you are concerned about the possible androgenic effects of your birth control, or symptoms or side effects such as acne, hair growth or hair loss, then speak to a healthcare professional.\n",

        "Title": "Our most popular contraceptives: IUS v combination pill",
        "Content": "\nChoosing the right contraception for you is an important one and a decision, that we are sure you are aware of by now, can often take a while to figure out.\nBy highlighting how each method works, what the advantages and disadvantages are for both, and what our reviewers say, we hope it helps you get to the stage where you have found your perfect match that little bit quicker.\nIn this piece, The Lowdown brings you information, comparisons and reviews of the IUS (or coil) and the combination pill, as our users’ favourites.\nOf course, there are many different brands of each, and symptoms and experiences will vary, but we hope that this article brings you a generic round up of both to help you make a better decision on which may be the best one for you.\nAt a glance: the advantages and disadvantages\n\nIt is more than 99% effective at preventing pregnancy. This means that over the course of 1 year, less than 1 in 100 women will get pregnant whilst using it\nOnce it is in, you do not have to do anything until it needs to be replaced\nIt works for between 3 to 8 years, depending on the brand.\nPeriods usually become less painful, lighter and shorter and may become less frequent or stop altogether\nYour fertility returns to what is normal for you as soon as it is removed – meaning it is possible to get pregnant straight away\nIt is not affected by other medicines\nIt might be a good option if you cannot take the hormone oestrogen\nThe Mirena, Levosert and Benilexa coils can also be used as part of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which is used in the management of menopausal symptoms\nHormonal coils are the first line treatment for heavy periods and can be used to treat endometriosis and adenomyosis\n\nThe Combined Pill – Advantages\n\nWith perfect use (using the method correctly all the time) the pill is over 99% effective, and with typical use it is around 91% effective\nIt usually makes your periods regular, lighter and less painful\nYou have the choice to skip a monthly bleed by using continuous pill taking\nIt can improve acne\nIt can reduce symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS)\nIt can help manage symptoms associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), including acne, abnormal hair growth and irregular or no periods\nIt can reduce the risk of recurrent endometriosis after surgery\nIt reduces the risk of endometrial, ovarian and colorectal cancer\nYou have control over when to stop taking it (although it’s worth discussing with your healthcare professional if you wish to avoid pregnancy or switch methods)\nAs soon as you stop taking it your fertility will return to what is normal for you.\n\nThe IUS – Disadvantages\n\nYou will need an appointment with a doctor or nurse and will need to have a pelvic examination to have the IUS fitted\nThere is a small risk of infection when it is fitted and you may be advised to have a test for STIs beforehand\nThere is a very small risk of damage to the womb when your IUS is fitted (1 in 1000)\nThere is a small chance the IUS can move or be pushed out of the womb (1 in 20). After fitting, you will be taught how to check your coil threads to make sure it’s still in place\nIn the rare chance you do become pregnant while using the IUS, there is a small risk of an ectopic pregnancy (a pregnancy outside of the womb)\nYou may get period type pain and some light bleeding after it is fitted, which should improve\nSome women experience irregular bleeding or ‘spotting’, especially in the first 3-6 months which usually settles\nSome women experience headaches, acne and breast tenderness which usually improve after the first few months. Some women experience changes in libido and mood. \nRarely, women can develop small fluid filled cysts on their ovaries. These are usually harmless and resolve without treatment\nYou will need to have an appointment with a doctor or nurse for it to be removed – although this is quicker and easier than an insertion\nThe IUS does not protect you from sexually transmitted infections (STIs), so for this you need to use condoms as well.\n\nThe Combined Pill – Disadvantages\n\nYou must remember to take it every day, preferably at the same time\nMissing pills, vomiting or severe diarrhoea can make it less effective\nSome medicines can interact with the pill, meaning it might not work properly. If you are taking other medicines then you should check this with your doctor, nurse or pharmacist\nIrregular bleeding and spotting is common in the first few months of using the pill, but this usually settles\nSome women experience headaches, breast tenderness or nausea which usually improve after the first few months. Some women experience changes in libido and mood. \nIt can increase blood pressure\nThere is a small increased risk of developing a blood clot when taking the combined pill. This means a blood clot in the leg or lung, or a heart attack or stroke. These risks are very small and the pill is considered safe in most healthy women. \nThe pill can slightly increase the risk of developing breast and cervical cancer. This reduces with time after stopping the pill. And please remember to attend your cervical screening!\nThe pill does not protect you from sexually transmitted infections (STIs) so for this you need to use condoms as well.\n\nThe stats\nWhat do our reviewers say?\nOne difficult thing about contraception is that everyone can react differently to the same product, meaning it is tricky to get a good idea about what might be best for you. Here, we have collated user feedback so that you hopefully have a better idea of what the IUS and combined pill might mean for you.\nFor the IUS, the most common immediate side effect is cramping, with around 63% of reviewers reporting pain. For the combined pill, the most common immediate side effect is tender breasts with 53% of reviewers reporting a change.\nAlmost half (46%) of reviewers say the IUS stops their period completely, while 17% said their periods became irregular and 21% said they became lighter. For the combined pill, 46% experience lighter bleeds, with 14% reporting no change and 7% saying they were heavier.(from data taken on 21 May 2024)\nIUS (hormonal coil) reviews\nKyleena – ‘I feel like a different person’\n“I came off of Gederal 30/150 and got the hormonal coil, and can’t begin to explain how much better I feel, not to sound cliché but feel like a different person, I used to have anxiety over things I knew I sorta shouldn’t of had anxiety over and would wake up in the most foul mood for no reason whatsoever and now both those two things have completely gone. I also haven’t had a period yet and have had it for 4 months, only just a few random spots of blood on and off. My skin has also cleared up massively where as on the pill I was coming out in huge boil-like spots. The insertion is ever so slightly painful and I had bad cramps for about 2 days but now they’re gone too. I also noticed a huge difference in how hungry I’d get. On the pill I’d eat a big meal and fed hungry still so would really want to eat more and often did, however since being on the coil I’ve noticed that doesn’t happen anymore, like I’m only really hungry when I know I should be.”\nMirena – ‘I would highly recommend’\n“I have used the coil for best part of 20 years after my now 20 year old son was born. I would highly recommend, after trying the pill before this, hated that!”\nCombined pill reviews\nRigevidon – ‘Constantly in a bad mood’\nI have been taking this for a few weeks now and have already had a bad experience. I am constantly in a bad mood and my discharge has gotten much worse and my breasts are constantly tender.\nEloine – very happy”I have been taking the Eloine pill for 10 months now and it has been pretty good. Not much has really changed for me which is great. My periods are the same (if not lighter) , my skin has stayed clear and I haven’t lost or gained any weight. The only thing I have noticed a change in since taking Eloine is a slight increase in anxiety and being more emotional than I used to be. However, these aren’t too extreme and are manageable. Overall i’m very happy with the Eloine pill 😊”\nMillinette – ‘The best yet’\n“I have been on 4 type of birth control before this and this is the best yet. The effects I’ve experienced are minimal when on this pill. I in the first two weeks of taking it experienced some nausea and dizziness but nothing too extreme. I had a lot of problems previously with sex drive, headache and mood swings on other pills. This pill is 10/10 IMO.”\nThe IUS – how it works\nThe IUS – or the hormonal coil – is a small plastic device that is inserted into your womb by a doctor or nurse. It prevents pregnancy by releasing a synthetic form of the hormone progestogen, similar to the one produced by the ovaries. This makes the fluid at the cervix (neck of the womb) thicker and therefore harder for sperm to get through. It also thins the lining of the womb so a fertilised egg can’t implant and in some women stops them ovulating.\nThe insertion is a procedure that requires a pelvic exam and can be an uncomfortable procedure. Depending on the type of IUS, once it is in it can last between 3 to 8 years.\nIt can be fitted at any time during your menstrual cycle if you are definitely not pregnant. If fitted within the first 7 days of your cycle, you will be protected against pregnancy right away. If fitted at any other time, it is advised you use another form of contraception, such as condoms, for the next seven days.\nMost people with a uterus can use an IUS, including those who have never been pregnant. An IUS can also be fitted in the first 2 days after giving birth, (or after 4 weeks if not within 48 hours of birth) and immediately after an abortion.\nThe combined pill – how it works\nThe combined pill, the one usually referred to as just ‘the pill’, contains oestrogen and progestogen, similar to the hormones produced by the ovaries. The combined pill prevents pregnancy by stopping you ovulating (releasing an egg each month), thinning the lining of the womb and thickening the mucus in the neck of the womb, making it harder for sperm to reach an egg.\nTraditionally, combined pill packs contain 21 tablets which you take consistently before taking a 4 to 7 day break. During this pill break you might have a withdrawal bleed which can be caused by a drop in hormone levels. You might experience symptoms similar to your period, but it is usually a lot lighter and shorter.\nNowadays, you can also take the combined pill as a tailored regimen. This may include taking the pill for 21 days and stopping for 4 days, taking 2 or 3 packets back to back without a break, or taking the pill continuously without a break. For more information speak to your healthcare professional.\n",

        "Title": "My contraceptive experience: The injection and fertility",
        "Content": "\nAs a nurse, Shannon wants to help individuals make decisions about their health based on reliable and realistic information.  In order to do just that we wanted to share her story with you here, plus some insights from one of The Lowdown’s Clinical Directors, Dr Mel…\nShannon’s story\nI have used a range of contraception over the years. I have been with my husband since I was 15 years old and made the decision to start the pill. At 17 while on the pill I was given the beautiful surprise of my daughter who is now 10.\nFollowing the birth of my daughter I felt I needed something that was more convenient and less likely to be forgotten so that I could focus on getting my education and career back on track. The Depo injection seemed like a great choice for me, as I do not mind injections and the idea of a coil or implant did not appeal to me. I was asked if I was planning on having a baby in the next year and I of course quickly said NO. I was on this for around 4 years and I was then advised to take a break due to the risk of osteoporosis.** During the time I was having the injection I did not have a period.\nAlthough I was slightly grossed out by the idea of a contraceptive implant, I decided to try it. I had the implant inserted and can honestly say I soon forgot it was there! It was not painful when it was inserted or removed. I had this in for 3 years with no issues. I again did not have any periods during this time.\nI then decided to have a small break in between contraception to make sure I could still get a period! My period soon returned and was back to normal, this gave me the reassurance I needed and decided I was happy to go back on contraception.\nThis is when I came across the new Sayana Press. I honestly thought this was perfect. I was able to give myself the injection from the comfort of my own home every 3 months and only needed to attend the sexual health clinic once a year. They again asked me if I was planning to have a baby in the next year, I again quickly replied a firm NO.\n\nSo then comes the time when I had achieved everything I felt I needed to and the feeling suddenly hit me of how much I actually wanted another child. After having the talk with my husband we both agreed now was the right time and we were fully aware that it could take up to a year for my periods to get back to normal in order to begin trying. The reality of waiting for my body to go back to normal was a long, confusing and frustrating process.\nMy timeline: \n8th Sept 2019Last injection of sayana press25th Aug 2020First bleed 1 day small amount 2nd Sept 20201 day small amount6th Sept 20201 day small amount5th – 7th Dec 2020Normal bleed (previous periods before the injection would last around 3 days regular amount) 17th Dec – 18th Dec 2020Bleed small amount brown in colour20th – 27th Jan 2020Bleed regular to heavy amount\nI have taken numerous pregnancy tests over the past year just to be on the safe side, as I had symptoms of a period/pregnancy and could be extremely emotional at times (not like me at all).\nThe statement “are you planning to have a baby in the next year” or “it can take up to a year for your periods to return to normal” I feel is quite misleading. I feel this is misleading because this implies you will have some level of irregular period before it returns to normal in around a year’s time.\nIt is also important to remember that the year starts from when the therapeutic effect is over. It has been over a year since the therapeutic effect of the injection was over and my periods are nowhere near normal.\nI am 28 years old, am reasonably healthy, active and have a BMI of 24. Previously my periods were very regular and without complications.\nThe injection has definitely done what it was made to do, however I feel women who have not yet started a family or do feel they would like another child one day, should possibly see this option as a last resort and explore other options prior to starting the injection. I hope that by sharing my story, this will give other women a more realistic view of the injection and family planning.” \nA 2023 update from Shannon: \n“Hi, my name is Shannon and I previously wrote a review on the Sayana Press contraceptive injection. The reason I am now writing another review is because when I came off the injection, I was searching the internet like crazy trying to find other women’s experiences. I was disheartened when all I could find was either that they fell pregnant straight away or they just couldn’t fall pregnant. There was never any updates to say whether they actually managed to fall pregnant eventually. I don’t know about you but I don’t like ending stories on a sad note? So I thought I would give other women an update on my experience. As stated in my previous review, my last injection was on the 08/09/2019, therefore it would have stopped working around 15/12/2019. My periods didn’t really return to any normal pattern however….On the 27/08/22 I was surprised to find out I was pregnant. From my dates I would have fallen pregnant around July 2022 and I am now 27 weeks pregnant.We did not have any medical interventions in order to fall pregnant, it was a personal choice to let whatever happen, happen. And I feel extremely lucky that it did happen for us.” \nDr Mel’s comments\nUnfortunately Shannon’s experience highlights how a lack of accessible information and effective communication between health professionals and women who use contraception can lead to lots of anxiety for women, especially for those concerned about their fertility.\nWhilst other methods of contraception do not impact on your return to fertility after stopping, women starting or continuing on the progestogen-only injectables (both the Depo-Provera and Sayana Press) should be told there can be a delay in return of fertility up to one year after stopping. The contraceptive injection works mainly by stopping ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary ready for fertilisation). This advice is based on studies that looked at how long it took before ovulation and conception (falling pregnant) occurred after stopping the injection.1\nWhen we talk about a ‘return of fertility’ what we really mean is a return to a woman’s ‘usual’ fertility. This does not automatically mean that a year after stopping the injection a woman will be fertile or easily able to get pregnant. Her fertility will still depend on her age, genetics and any underlying medical problems. Women who have used contraception for most of their reproductive lives may not be aware of problems affecting their fertility, as contraceptive effects may mask symptoms such as irregular periods. For some women, it is only on stopping contraception, or trying to get pregnant, that they find out there may be an underlying issue.\nIn order to prevent pregnancy, the injection is usually given up to every 14 weeks. We know that even when it is administered every 16 weeks the rate of pregnancy is less than 1%.1 So in reality this does mean the potential delay of up to one year starts after deciding not to ‘renew’ the injection, or at least three to four months after the last injection was given. The time it takes is different in different women, and according to the manufacturer does not depend on how long you have been using the injection for.2,3 It is important to note that due to wide variation in return to fertility for individual women, women who do not wish to get pregnant on stopping the injection should be advised to start another contraceptive method before or at the time of their next scheduled injection.1\nSo what does this mean for your periods? Changes to your bleeding pattern is a common side effect with the contraceptive injection and it is normal for some women to have no periods whilst using it.1,2,3 This can be particularly useful for women who have heavy or painful periods.1 As periods and ovulation are linked, there is often a delay in return of periods for women after stopping the injection. However you can ovulate, and therefore get pregnant, without your periods being regular or ’normal’. It is not possible to tell you how long you should expect this to take, or what your bleeding pattern might be like, before your periods return to what is normal for you.\nShannon’s experience has shown that waiting for your fertility to return after stopping the injection can be a stressful experience. Irregular bleeding patterns after stopping the injection may not necessarily indicate whether you are ovulating or not. There is also no need to wait until your periods return to normal after stopping the injection before trying for a pregnancy. According to the manufacturer, over 80% of women trying to get pregnant conceived within 15 months of the last Depo-Provera injection.2 Similarly over 80% will get pregnant within a year of stopping Sayana Press.3 A study comparing how long it took to fall pregnant for women who stopped using the contraceptive injection compared to those who stopped using the non-hormonal copper coil showed that after 2 years there were no significant differences in pregnancy rates.1\nWhen thinking about whether to start, continue or stop the contraceptive injection, discuss any concerns or worries you may have with your healthcare professional. If you’re planning a pregnancy in the next few years, think about the options available to you, such as switching from the injection to another method that has a more easily reversible contraceptive effect. Ultimately, you need to understand the possible side effects of your method of contraception, and be able to discuss what this means for you with your doctor or nurse.\n** Progestogen-only injectable use is associated with a small loss of bone mineral density, which is usually recovered after discontinuation. Women using DMPA who wish to continue use should be reviewed every 2 years to assess individual situations, and to discuss the benefits and potential risks.1You can now buy the Sayana press injection directly from the Lowdown\nThis blog is a part of The Lowdown’s My Contraceptive Journey series.

        "Title": "The Hormonal Coil &#8211; all your questions answered",
        "Content": "\nThe Hormonal coil (aka the hormonal intrauterine device, intrauterine system or IUS) is women’s favourite method of contraception here at The Lowdown. The Hormonal coil (brands include Mirena, Levosert, Benilexa, Kyleena and Jaydess) tops our overall satisfaction ratings – with an average 3.6 out of 5.\nThe hormonal coil lasts 3 to 8 years depending on the brand, is very effective, and women are reporting lots of benefits. Lowdown data shows that it doesn’t seem to negatively impact mood or reduce women’s sex drive as much as other methods like the pill, implant and injection.\n47% of women at The Lowdown report that it caused their periods to stop (which many women like) – and it is successfully used by lots of women who suffer from heavy bleeding and conditions like endometriosis.👀 If you find this blog interesting, make sure to check out our newsletter:\nLowdown user reviews\n\n“I’ve been using the Mirena for 19 years. It’s brilliant, periods have stopped, there is the occasional spotting every 6-12 months. I don’t have to remember to take it each day. Myself and many of my female family members and friends are on it and all talk positively about it.”\n\n\n“I have used the coil for best part of 20 years after my now 20 year old son was born. I would highly recommend, after trying the pill before this, hated that!”\n\n\n“The day I had it fitted I had THE WORST cramps I have ever had but I did also have some post smear investigations done at the same time so they probably didn’t help. I had irregular bleeding for about 6 weeks due to having my implant removed and coming off the pill at the same time as having this fitted (hormones all over the place!) 3 months ish in and it’s the best thing I ever did! So side effects of the coil, no bleeding, no remembering to take anything and covered for years. Bonus I feel so much happier/positive, lost a bit of weigh (I do exercise a lot) and increased sex drive”\n\n\n“I know some women have amazing experiences with the mirena but I certainly was not one of them which is why I wanted to leave a review of my experiences. The actual insertion was not so bad but I ended up having to go back another day to get it put in knocked out as my cervix wouldn’t open. The first few months I got everything under the sun from constant UTI’s and brain fog, migraines, horrible moodiness, recurring thrush and cysts near my ovaries and irregular periods and pain throughout the whole month.\n\nWhat is the Mirena Coil?\nThe Mirena Coil is a brand of the hormonal coil. It is a small, T-shaped plastic device that is inserted into the uterus to act as contraception (but can also help manage heavy periods and be sued as part of HRT). It must be inserted by a trained healthcare provider and can last up to 8 years for contraception if under the age of 45 (over the age of 45 you can keep the coil in until you are 55). It can usually be easily removed at any time.\nHow does the Mirena Coil work?\nThe Mirena Coil, like other hormonal coils, prevents pregnancy by releasing the hormone progestogen into the womb. This works to thicken the cervical mucus, to prevent the sperm and egg from meeting, and to thin the lining of the womb so a fertilised egg cannot implant. It can also stop ovulation for some people, while for others it will continue as usual. \nThe progestogen released by the hormonal coil is thought to act “locally”, with lower levels of progestogen in the blood stream than other hormonal contraceptive methods. This means that it may be less likely to cause negative symptoms, for example mood swings. Although we know there are wide differences between users’ experiences, this could help explain why it’s one of the most popular forms of contraception amongst The Lowdown users.\nHow effective is it?\nThe hormonal coil is a very effective method of contraception, as it doesn’t rely on the individual remembering to take it or use it. \nThe hormonal coil is over 99% effective. Less than one user in 100 will get pregnant in one year. To put into context, if 100 sexually active women don’t use any contraception, 80-90 will get pregnant in a year.\nHow is the hormonal coil inserted?\nThe hormonal coil needs to be inserted by a trained healthcare provider. Before fitting, they will do a number of tests, including:\n\nChecking the size and position of your womb\nChecking for any possible STIs and treating with antibiotics if needed\n\nThe actual insertion takes between 15-20 minutes. The vagina will be held open with a small speculum, the same way as it is during a smear test, and the coil is inserted through the cervix (the neck of the womb) into the womb. The doctor or nurse may offer painkiller tablets or local anaesthetic to make the fitting more comfortable.\nThe hormonal coil has two threads which hang through the opening of the cervix into the vagina. Your doctor or nurse that does the fitting will explain to you how to feel for these threads and check the coil is in place. You should check the threads a few times during the first month and then at regular intervals, after your period or at least once a month.\nIf you are worried or cannot feel the threads, you should use additional contraception such as condoms and contact your doctor or nurse. They may suggest a check up and will consider the need for emergency contraception. Otherwise you will only need to go back when the coil needs to be replaced.\nHow long does it take the hormonal coil to prevent against pregnancy?\nThe hormonal coil can be fitted at any time during your cycle. If fitted in the first five days of your menstrual cycle you will be immediately protected from pregnancy. If fitted any other time, you will need to use extra protection (i.e condoms) for the first seven days. \nIf you have a short menstrual cycle, where your period normally comes every 23 days or less, check with your healthcare professional as you might ovulate early in your menstrual cycle. \nHow is the hormonal coil removed?\nThe hormonal coil can be removed at any time – but must be done by a doctor or nurse.\nThe procedure is usually simple and quicker than when inserted. It is removed by gently pulling on the threads, making the T shape fold up so it is easily pulled out of the womb.\nIf you have the coil removed but you don’t want to get pregnant, use additional contraception, such as condoms, for 7 days before you have it removed. Ideally if you have another form of contraception that you wish to switch to, speak to your doctor beforehand as you may be able to start this before your coil is removed. If you’re having the hormonal coil replaced, your doctor or nurse will normally recommend you still use condoms for 7 days before the removal. This is in case there is a problem with fitting the replacement coil, although this is rare.\nNormal fertility should return to your baseline once the coil has been removed.\nWhen should you seek advice from your doctor or nurse after fitting?\nInitially afterwards fitting, you may experience light bleeding and period-like cramps which you can take over the counter pain relief for. However if you experience severe or prolonged tummy pain, you feel unwell, especially with a fever, or you feel hot or clammy, you experience heavy bleeding or smelly discharge or you are concerned, please contact your doctor.\nAdvantages of the hormonal coil\n\nIt is effective for 3 to 8 years (depending on the brand)\nIt is one of the most effective forms of contraception available\nIt does not interrupt sex\nIt is safe to use whilst breastfeeding\nIt is not affected by other medicines or illnesses such as vomiting and diarrhoea\nYour periods may be less painful and become lighter, shorter, or stop completely\nIt is possible to get pregnant as soon as it is removed \nThere’s no evidence that a contraceptive coil will affect your weight or increase the risk of cervical cancer, cancer of the uterus or ovarian cancer\nIt is suitable for women who can’t use contraception containing oestrogen.\n\nSide effects of the Mirena coil\n\nIt may cause some irregular bleeding or spotting, which should settle down after the first 3-6 months. Your periods may stop altogether whilst using the hormonal coil, which may not be suitable for some women.\nIt can cause temporary side effects such as skin problems, headaches or breast tenderness\nIt can cause small fluid-filled cysts on your ovaries which often have no symptoms and disappear without treatment.\n\n\nRisks of the hormonal coil\n\nThere is a small risk of getting an infection after the coil is inserted, this could lead to a pelvic infection if not treated.\nThere is a small risk of the coil becoming pushed out or being displaced. This is more likely just after fitting and within the first 3 months (1 cases in 20). This is why it is important to check you can feel the coil threads in place\nThere is a very small risk of damage to the uterus (1-2 cases in 1000).\nIf you do become pregnant while you are using the coil (which is very rare) there is a small risk of ectopic pregnancy\nLastly, there may be an association between current or recent hormonal coil use and breast cancer, however, any potential increased risk appears to be small.\n\nIs it safe to use a menstrual cup with an IUS?\nThere hasn’t been a large number of research studies looking at coil and menstrual cup use, but some evidence suggests there might be a slightly increased risk of your coil coming out while using a menstrual cup. There doesn’t seem to be any increased risk of infection while using an IUS and menstrual cup.The moon cup manufacturers advise to wait 6 weeks after insertion of an IUS before using a moon cup. It is also advised that the cup be placed with an adequate seal low in the vagina. The seal needs to be broken first before the cup is removed to ensure your IUS is not dislodged. It is important to check your threads after your period, to ensure your IUS is not dislodged. If you have any concerns, speak to your GP or sexual health clinic.\nNon contraceptive benefits / uses\n\nIt can make your periods lighter, shorter and less painful or stop them altogether. For women who experience painful or heavy periods, and associated conditions such as iron deficiency anaemia, the benefits can be life-changing.\nIt may also be used to treat other conditions that your doctor or nurse may discuss, but these will be on an individual basis.\nThe Mirena coil can be used alongside oestrogen therapy as a component of hormone replacement therapy to treat symptoms of the menopause.\n\nDifferent types of IUS\nThere are five types of the IUS available in the UK – Mirena, Levosert, Benilexa, Jaydess and Kyleena. However, not all GP surgeries or sexual health clinics will offer all options. This is normally dependent on the training of the practitioner and if the hormonal coil is being used to treat medical conditions, as well as to provide contraception. If the choice is available, this will be discussed with you during the appointment.\n",

        "Title": "Combined Pill VS Mini Pill",
        "Content": "\nThe two types of contraceptive pills, the combined pill and the mini pill (also known as the progestogen only pill or POP) are a popular form of contraception amongst many women.\nIn this blog, we give you the lowdown on the differences, side effects and our user experiences of both the contraceptive pills.👀 If you think you’ll find this blog interesting, make sure to check out our newsletter for more:\nWhat is the difference? \nCombined oral contraceptive pill: This contains artificial versions of hormones oestrogen and progesterone, which are produced naturally in the ovaries.\nProgestogen only pill: This contains a synthetic progestogen hormone, similar to the natural progesterone produced by the ovaries.\nPOPs are different to combined pills because they don’t contain the hormone oestrogen. These are available through your GP or sexual health clinic and you can also buy the mini pill or combined pill easily at The Lowdown. We have a range of mini pills on offer, including: \n\nDesomono pill\nDesogestrel\nHana contraceptive pill\nMicronor pill\nNoriday pill\nAizea pill\nFeanolla pill\nLovima pill\nNorgeston pill\nZelleta pill\n\n \n\nHow do they work? \nBoth the combined pill and POP are a small tablet you swallow daily.\nThe combined pill prevents pregnancy in three ways: by stopping ovulation, making the fluid in your cervix thicker (which makes it more difficult for sperm to enter the womb) and preventing the lining of your womb thickening enough for a fertilised egg to implant and grow in it.\nThe POP prevents pregnancy by making the fluid in your cervix thicker (which makes it more difficult for sperm to enter the womb), and preventing the lining of your womb thickening enough for a fertilised egg to implant and grow in it. POPs containing desogestrel can also stop ovulation.\nHow do you take each pill?\nCombined pill \n\nYou can start taking the pill at any point in your menstrual cycle if you are sure you are not pregnant\nThere is special advice if you have just had a baby, miscarriage or abortion\nIf you start up to and including the 5th day of your period you are protected against pregnancy immediately (if you have short menstrual cycles (less than 28 days) this may not be the case so get advice)\nIf you start at any other time in menstrual cycle use additional contraception such as condoms for first 7 days of pill taking\n The standard way of taking the combined pill is to take a pill every day for 21 days (the length of a packet) then have a 7 day break during which you will usually have a bleed like a period, before starting a new pack again\nYou can also take the combined pill as a tailored regimen. This may include taking the pill for 21 days and stopping for 4, taking 2 or 3 packets back to back without a break, or taking the pill continuously without a break. For more info on this check out our continuous pill taking blog. \n\n\nPOP\nFor the progestogen only pill the advice differs depending on type.  \nPOPs containing desogestrel, levonorgestrel or norethisterone:\n\nYou can start at any time in menstrual cycle if sure not pregnant\nIf you start taking the pill during the first 5 days of your period you are protected against pregnancy immediately (if you have short menstrual cycles (less than 28 days) this may not be the case so get advice)\nIf you start at any other time in your menstrual cycle use additional contraception such as condoms for the first 2 full days of pill taking\nYou should continue to take the pill every day, at the same time each day, with no breaks between packs\nFor POPs containing desogestrel you need to remember to take your pill within 12 hours of your usual time, for other POPs you have a 3 hour window to remember.\n\nPOPs containing drospirenone:\n\nYou can start at any time in menstrual cycle if sure not pregnant\nIf you start taking the pill on the first day of your period you are protected against pregnancy immediately (if you have short menstrual cycles (less than 28 days) this may not be the case so get advice)\nIf you start at any other time in your menstrual cycle use additional contraception such as condoms for the first 7 days of pill taking\nThe drospirenone pill comes in packets of 24 active pills and 4 placebo (sugar or dummy) pills \nYou should continue to take the pill every day, at the same time each day, with no breaks between packs\nFor POPs containing drospirenone you need to remember to take your pill within 24 hours of your usual time.\n\n \n\nWhat to do if you miss a pill?\nUse The Lowdown’s missed pill calculator to determine whether you may need to use additional contraception such as condoms and consider emergency contraception. The outcome will vary depending on which type of pill you’re taking, how many pills you miss and where in your packet you are.\nSide effects of the pill:\nCombined pill: \n\nHeadaches\nNausea\nMood swings\nChanges to libido (sex drive)\nEnlarged breasts and breast tenderness\nVaginal discharge\n \n\nThese are usually temporary and settle after the first few months. However if they continue or are bothering you speak to your doctor or nurse.\nPOP: \n\nSpots or acne\nIrregular bleeding or spotting\nTender and enlarged Breasts\nHeadaches\nMood changes\nChanges to libido (sex drive)\nNausea\nSmall fluid-filled sacs (cysts) on your ovaries that are usually harmless and disappear without treatment\n \n\nGenerally the POP is well tolerated. Side effects may improve after the first few months of taking it. If they continue or are bothering you speak to your doctor or nurse.\nAdvantages of the pill \nCombined pill: \n\nUsually makes your bleeds regular, lighter and less painful\nGives you the choice not to have a monthly bleed\nMay help with premenstrual symptoms\nImproves acne in some people\nMay reduce menopausal symptoms\nHelps with problems associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\nMay reduce the risk of recurrent endometriosis after surgery\nReduces the risk of cancer of the ovary, uterus, and colon\nMay reduce the risk of fibroids, ovarian cysts and non-cancerous breast disease\n \n\nPOP:\n\nPeriods may get lighter, less frequent or stop altogether\nUseful if you can’t take oestrogen, like in the combined pill, contraceptive patch or vaginal ring\nYou can use it at any age, but it’s especially useful if you are over 50, or smoke and are over 35 (when you are usually advised not to use the combined pill)\nMay help with premenstrual symptoms and painful periods\nYou can use it if you’re breastfeeding\n\nDisadvantages of the pill\nCombined pill:\n\nThere are some serious possible side effects:\n\nYou may get temporary side effects at first including headaches, nausea, breast tenderness and mood changes; if these don’t stop within a few months, discussing with your doctor or nurse and possibly changing the type of pill or contraception method may help\nThe pill doesn’t protect you from sexually transmitted infections, so you may need to use condoms as well\nBreakthrough bleeding (unexpected vaginal bleeding on pill taking days) and spotting is common in the first few months of use\nThe pill may increase your blood pressure\nTaking the pill is associated with an increased risk of some serious health conditions, such as blood clots and breast cancer\n \n\nPOP:  \nThere are no serious but some possible side effects:\n\nYour periods may change in a way that’s not acceptable to you (your periods may be lighter, more or less frequent, or may stop altogether, and you may get spotting between periods)\nThe POP doesn’t protect you against sexually transmitted infections, so you may need to use condoms as well\nYou may get some side effects when you first start taking the POP, such as spotty skin, breast tenderness and headaches. These may stop within a few months.\n\n \n\nLowdown Reviews \n‘Made my skin loads better. Did take around 6-8 months for my skin to improve though. The first week of taking the pill I became so emotionally sensitive, which is unlike me. But after a week I seemed to return to normal. I am pretty prone to thrush but I found it has increased my likelihood. Other than that I would recommend this pill’ – COMBINED PILL‘Been on it for a few years now. Highly recommend don’t have a period at all now.’ – POP\nWhere can you get the the combined pill or POP from? \nYou can get your contraception from your GP or sexual health clinic, or order your prescription from The Lowdown and have it delivered directly to your door! You will need to answer our short questionnaire about your medical and family history, and provide a recent blood pressure reading and weight measurement if you would like the combined pill. If you’re not currently on the contraceptive pill and would like to discuss your options, you can also book an appointment with one of our lovely GPs.\n",

        "Title": "Blood clots and birth control – what are the risks?",
        "Content": "\nDoctors use the blanket term venous thromboembolism (shortened to VTE) to refer to blood clots that form in deep veins (deep vein thrombosis) – often in the leg – and for blood clots that dislodge and travel to blood vessels elsewhere in the body – such as the lungs (pulmonary embolism)2.\nIf a blood clot blocks an artery it can prevent blood reaching important organs. In worst case scenarios this can result in long term, irreversible damage, or death.\nWhich all sounds pretty scary.\nWhat causes blood clots in birth control?\nMost forms of contraception use the hormones oestrogen and progestin, also known as progestogen. Hormones are chemicals produced by the body to regulate different processes, and researchers have known since the 1970s that there is a relationship between contraception containing synthetic oestrogen and blood clots.\nWhile the exact mechanism isn’t known, research suggests that oestrogen reduces the body’s ability to regulate clotting, making the blood less able to stop forming clots even when it’s not the right time or place.\nMore specifically, oestrogen appears to dull the body’s sensitivity to an enzyme (a protein that speeds up a biochemical process) called activated protein C (APC). APC downregulates clotting, which means it acts to slow or stop the blood clotting process in response to the body’s needs. With the body less sensitive to APC, the blood is less able to stop clotting.\nResearch studies have shown higher levels of APC resistance in people taking the combined pill compared to those who are not taking the pill3,4,5.\nBefore we continue, let’s take a moment to talk risk.\n\nWhat do we mean by increased risk?\nWhenever we read about increased risk, it’s important to know what the baseline risk is. In this case, the baseline risk is the risk of developing a blood clot if you are premenopausal, not pregnant, and not taking any form of birth control. If we tracked 10,000 such women for a whole year, we would expect between two and six of them to develop blood clots6. Put another way, that’s less than 0.1% per year. This baseline risk is so low that increasing it several times over will still result in a very small overall risk for most people.\nHowever, even a small risk can be a cause of concern if you have other risk factors for blood clots, such as a family history. That’s why it’s so important to let your healthcare professional know about your medical and family history before making decisions about your birth control.\nArmed with knowledge of the baseline risk, let’s look at different types of contraception.\n\nWhat is the increased risk of blood clots for different birth control methods?\nCombined oral contraceptives\n\n\nThe combined pill is made up of oestrogen and progestin.\nThe risk of developing blood clots when taking the combined pill is between 2 and 5 times higher than the risk of blood clots in women who do not take the pill7,8.\nProgestogens (also called progestins) are a synthetic hormone used in all hormonal contraceptives. There are several types of progestin that have slightly different chemical makeups, but they all work in similar ways.\nWe know that progestins on their own do not appear to increase the risk of blood clots, but research has shown that in the combined hormonal contraceptives, different types of progestin used alongside oestrogen seem to have different effects on blood clot risk.\n\nDifferent types of combined pill and blood clot risk\n\nA study from 20159 investigated this risk a little further, and found differences depending on the type of progestin used in the birth control pill.\nThis large Dutch study that looked at health data from thousands of women aged 15-49 across the Netherlands who had had a blood clot for the first time. They looked at the types of contraceptive they used, if any.\nThe research, which has been replicated, showed that different types of progestin used in the combined oral contraceptive pill seem to result in different risk levels for blood clots. It is not yet known why, but it may be to do with how some older progestins counteract the unwanted effects of oestrogen on the clotting process, while newer forms of progestins do not.\nYou can see below which types of progestin are associated with an increased risk of blood clots when used in the combined oral contraceptive pill, and which brands contain these different types. \nTaking a combined pill containing a type of progestin called levonorgestrel resulted in the lowest increase in blood clot risk, while pills containing cyproterone acetate present the biggest increase in risk.\nThe majority of women in the UK already take a combined pill containing the lower risk combination with levonorgestrel10, and pills with other types of progestin are usually only offered when additional health needs are present, such as severe acne.\nFor example, the Yasmin contraceptive pill has a slightly higher blood clot risk compared to other combined pills.\n\n  You can view each combined pill ingredients on our product pages. For example, the Microgynon contraceptive pill.\n\nThe patch and the vaginal ring\n\nMuch less research has been conducted into blood clot risk with the patch and vaginal ring.\nThe patch contains oestrogen. It does appear to increase blood clots risk, and a large Danish study14 found that this risk was just over twice the risk of the oral combined pill. \nThe vaginal ring also contains oestrogen, and research suggests it, too, increases blood clot risk15. In the same Danish study, researchers found the risk was just under two times the risk of the oral combined pill.\nThe NHS currently advises against use of the patch or the ring where a woman has a history of blood clots16,17.\nMore research is needed to understand more fully the risk of blood clots associated with both of these forms of contraceptive.\n\n\n\nProgestogen-only pill and the implant (Nexplanon)\n\nCurrent evidence suggests that progestogen-only pills (like the Hana mini pill)  does not increase the risk of blood clots in healthy women.\nThe progestogen only implant also does not increase the risk of blood clots in healthy women11,12,13. \nThis is why progestogen-only forms of hormonal contraception are often offered as an alternative to the combined pill for women with increased risk of blood clots.\n\n\nThe hormonal and copper coils\n\nThere is relatively little published research into the hormonal (progestin releasing) IUS or copper IUD and blood clot risk, but it is currently understood that neither increase the risk in healthy women18,19.\n\nThis table summarises the risk of blood clots for every method of contraception:\n\nStatistics taken from the following studies  1) Venous thrombosis in users of non-oral hormonal contraception: follow-up study, Denmark 2001-10 & 2) The epidemiology of venous thromboembolism\nShould you be worried about blood clots on the pill\n\nFor most women, the increase in the risk of blood clots from hormonal contraceptives doesn’t present a concern.\nBecause blood clots are a much higher risk during pregnancy – four to five times the baseline risk20,21 and even higher in the first 6 weeks after giving birth, the consensus in the medical profession is that taking the combined pill is safer than pregnancy.\nHowever, if you have a family history of blood clots or a condition that predisposes you to blood clots (such as sickle cell anaemia, or thrombophilia), it’s really important that your healthcare professional knows this before you decide on the best form of contraception. \n\n\nWhat are the signs of a blood clot?\n\nThrobbing or cramping pain in the leg or arm\nSwelling, redness and warmth in a leg or arm\nSudden breathlessness, sharp chest pain (may be worse when you breathe in) and a cough or coughing up blood\n\n\nFind out more about symptoms and what to do if you think you have a blood clot on the NHS website.\nIn summary\n\nBlood clotting is a vital process that prevents excessive bleeding, but if clots form when and where they are not supposed to, the results can be very dangerous.\nThe baseline risk of blood clots is so low that increasing it several times over will still result in a very small overall risk for most people.\nDifferent contraceptive methods have different risks for blood clots. Women taking the combined pill have between a 2 and 5 times higher risk of blood clots compared to women who do not take the pill. Progestogen-only methods do not increase the risk of blood clots.\nFor most women, a small increase in risk of blood clots isn’t a concern, but if you have a family or medical history that predisposes you to blood clots the combined risk becomes much higher.\nA contraceptive discussion with your GP or healthcare professional should always cover your family and medical history.\n\n\n",

        "Title": "Best contraception for PCOS &#8211; The Lowdown guide",
        "Content": "   \nPCOS is a fairly common condition affecting women of reproductive age.  Whilst PCOS cannot be cured, symptoms such as acne and irregular periods can often be managed with contraception. But which birth control is best for PCOS?\nWhat is PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome)?\nPolycystic Ovary Syndrome, also known as PCOS, is a condition that affects how a woman’s ovaries work. Its exact cause is unknown but it is thought to be related to an imbalance of hormones which means that an egg may not develop as it should. This can impact on ovulation and can cause irregular periods. Polycystic ovaries contain harmless follicles that are undeveloped sacs in which eggs develop. As these sacs are often unable to release an egg, ovulation may therefore not take place.\nWhat are PCOS symptoms?\nPCOS can come with a variety of symptoms which may vary from person to person. Not all women with PCOS will have all of the symptoms, and each symptom can vary from mild to severe. You can anonymously share your own personal PCOS experience with The Lowdown in this space. Using a Myoovi can help relieve any period pain that you may suffer with PCOS. The idea of this TENS machine is to instantly stop any cramps you may be having.\nIrregular periods including missed periods and no periods\n\nIncreased body hair usually around the stomach, chest, face or back (called hirsutism)\nAcne or oily skin\nDifficulty getting pregnant as a result of irregular ovulation or not ovulating\nHair loss – women may experience thinning of the hair on their head\nWeight gain\n\nYou should talk to your GP, or one of our amazing doctors at The Lowdown, if you have any of these symptoms and think you may have PCOS. Whilst PCOS cannot be cured, the symptoms of PCOS can be managed. Your GP will be able to recommend the best treatment options depending on your symptoms.\nBest contraception for PCOS\n\nThe combined pill\nThe hormonal coil (IUS)\n\nThe best pill for PCOS\nThe combined pill may be recommended as a form of contraception if you have PCOS and is a way to induce more regular periods. Progesterone tablets may also be used for 10-14 days of the cycle to help induce bleeds, to help reduce the risk of endometrial cancer which is associated with not having regular periods. The combined pill may also be recommended as a way to manage PCOS symptoms such as acne, hair loss and hirsutism.\nWhat about the vaginal ring and contraceptive patch?\nSimilar to the combined pill, the vaginal ring and contraceptive patch are methods which also contain oestrogen and progestogen. This means that although compared to the combined pill they may look different and how you use them is different, these three methods all act in the same way and have the same benefits for women with PCOS.\nThe hormonal coil (IUS) for PCOS \nThe hormonal coil may also be recommended as another method of contraception for someone with PCOS as it keeps the womb lining thin, reducing the risk of endometrial cancer, though it may not produce regular periods.\nCan your contraception make you gain weight if you have PCOS? \nWith PCOS there are some contraceptives that are more widely recognised as making users gain weight. Whilst the mini pill may also be an option for some women with PCOS, some of our mini pill reviews had personal experiences with the progesterone only pill that caused them to put on weight. Weight gain is a possible side effect for a minority of women of the contraceptive injection such as Sayana Press, so this form of contraception is not recommended if this is an issue. If users are already overweight then the combined pill may not be right for you and it is best to seek a your doctor’s advice.\nBest contraceptives for managing PCOS symptoms\nThe combined pill is usually prescribed as the best birth control for PCOS acne sufferers. Containing both oestrogen and progestogen, the combined pill can help oily skin and acne.\nIf you are struggling with hair loss or excessive hair growth (hirsutism) due to excessive androgens related to PCOS, your GP may also recommend the combined pill as a form of treatment.\nIt will vary from person-to-person as to which contraception is best for PCOS, so ensure you seek advice from a medical professional before choosing your method. \nHatty is a freelance digital marketing consultant with over 10 years experience.

        "Title": "Spotting on birth control &#8211; what does it mean?",
        "Content": "\n\nSpotting and irregular bleeding on contraception is a common experience – so firstly, don’t worry!\nIn this post we share all on what spotting and irregular bleeding is, what to look out for and when to see your doctor.✅ If you think you’ll find this blog useful, make sure to check out our newsletter:\nWhat is spotting?\nSpotting describes episodes of light bleeding (including light brown discharge) which you may experience between your regular menstrual periods. Doctors may refer to this as intermenstrual bleeding or as breakthrough bleeding if you are using contraception.We need to be aware of our bodies and pay close attention to any changes in normal bleeding patterns from month to month. Spotting can be normal when using contraception and certain factors, for example smoking, increase the risk of experiencing breakthrough bleeding. However there are some instances where you should get it checked out by a doctor. Luckily for us, contraception can often help to control irregular bleeding and if you want to know which birth control methods are best to avoid spotting, when you should be concerned about spotting and when to see a doctor – then keep reading!\nHow long does spotting last on birth control?\nSpotting on birth control, also known as breakthrough bleeding, typically occurs in the first six months of taking a new contraceptive. When starting a new method it can take time to regulate the menstrual cycle as the body needs to adjust to the new hormones. This can cause you to experience some spotting or bleeding between periods. With most methods this settles down after a few months but may persist for some contraception users.\nWhat can cause spotting on birth control?\nProgestogen in hormonal contraception leads to changes in the lining of the womb, called the endometrium. Progestogen may thin the endometrial lining, which can cause some bleeding. A thinner lining helps prevent pregnancy as a fertilised egg cannot implant into the womb lining. Other potential causes of spotting while on the pill are:\n\nForgetting to take a pill for a day or more\nInfection – sexually transmitted infections can lead to irritation and inflammation of the uterus or cervix which may cause bleeding\nTaking a new medication – some drugs can interfere with the effectiveness of birth control pills. You should always check with your doctor before taking a new medication\nVomiting or diarrhoea\nPregnancy – spotting while on birth control doesn’t always mean you’re pregnant, however pregnant women can experience implantation bleeding or spotting as a result of the implantation of a fertilised egg in the lining of the uterus.\n\n\nWhat types of birth control are most likely to cause spotting?\nBleeding patterns have been researched (which is unusual for contraception side effects!) and expected patterns for different hormonal options have been summarised by the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Health (FSRH) which we delve into below.¹ It’s also worth checking out our user reviews and seeing how our Lowdown reviewers reported changes to their periods with different contraceptive methods.Hormonal methods containing only progestogen are the most likely to cause spotting. These include:\n\nThe contraceptive implant\n\nThe implant can cause long bleeding episodes (over 14 days) in 20% of women and frequent bleeding aka spotting in around 10% of women. The bleeding pattern you have in the first 3 months of use, is generally a good predictor of what will happen for the duration of use.\n\nThe progestogen only pill (mini pills like Hana, Lovima, Desogestrel.)\n\nDesogestrel based mini pills have similar spotting rates to the implant and stop periods altogether in up to 30% of users.² However, the traditional mini pills which include Norgeston, Noriday and Micronor change bleeding patterns in around one third of users and are more likely to cause frequent or irregular bleeding than to stop periods altogether. \n\nThe contraceptive injection (such as Sayana Press)\n\nBleeding disturbances including spotting, prolonged (over 14 days) or heavy bleeding are common initially, but after 12 months of use half of users won’t have any bleeding at all!\n\nThe hormonal coil\n\nWith all types of hormonal coil, spotting is common in the first 3 to 6 months after insertion. However, after this the Mirena, Levosert or Benilexa coil can reduce blood loss by a huge 90% and around 40% of users will have no periods in the longterm.¹ ³ Lower dose hormonal coils including the Jaydess may not control bleeding or spotting as successfully, but 13% of users can still look forward to no periods.The copper coil does not contain hormones but may cause spotting especially in the first few months after fitting. Combined hormonal contraception containing oestrogen and progestogen (the combined pill, patch or ring) may cause spotting in the first 3 months of use in 20% of women. However, this often settles and users will then normally only experience bleeding when they choose to have a break of up to 7 days between packs. This is known as a ‘withdrawal bleed’.\nWhen should you be concerned about spotting? \nSpotting is normal when starting or changing contraception, however if it is still occurring after six months, or is new after you’ve been on your contraception with a stable bleeding pattern for a while, then this could mean an underlying issue. These could include:\n\nSTI’s, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea\nPelvic inflammatory disease (PID)\nCervical ectropion (a fragile area on the cervix which bleeds easily and is often made worsen by contraceptive pill)\nChanges to the cervix which might eventually lead to cancer\nInjury to the vagina, for example with sex\nVaginal dryness which might be due to hormonal changes\nPregnancy or pregnancy loss\n\nHow to stop spotting on birth control  \nTop tips to help reduce your irregular bleeding!\n\nEnsure you’re taking the pill at a similar time every day to help maintain consistent hormone levels in your body. Using apps and trying to get into a routine can help this.\nContinue to take your contraceptive pill regularly even if spotting does occur. If you’ve been taking the pill for less than six months, your body may not have had enough time to adjust fully \nCheck any other medications to ensure that they do not interfere with the effectiveness of the pill \nIf spotting is related to the implant and is problematic after 3 to 6 months then it is worth talking to your GP, practice nurse or local contraception clinic about adding in other medication to help\nIf you think vomiting or diarrhoea may be affecting your ability to absorb the pill, speak to your doctor about this\n\nThere are also certain treatment or medications that may help with bleeding, such as adding in extra hormones or changing how you use your contraceptive. These are best discussed with you healthcare professional.\nHow to manage spotting \nDeciding whether or not you should use a tampon or pad depends on how light or heavy the bleeding is and which you prefer to use. Alternatively, investing in some period pants (Modibodi or WUKA) could help you feel more secure throughout the day knowing that if you do spot it won’t be visible. With any spotting it is worth getting a self taken sexual health screen which you can access via your GP, sexual health clinic or online. This checks for chlamydia and gonorrhea which are common causes of spotting in younger women. Also, make sure you have had your cervical cancer screening if you are over 25.\nWhen to see a doctor… \nLike any medication, some people can use their contraception with no complications, however others may experience problems. You should speak to your doctor if any of the following occur:\n\nPersistent bleeding on a contraceptive method after 6 months of use\nNew bleeding or spotting or a change in bleeding pattern after you’ve been on your contraception for a while\nBleeding regularly after sex\nBlood and discharge especially if there is an offensive smell\nSpotting after a new change in sexual partner as this could suggest a sexually transmitted infection\nHeavy bleeding (soaking a pad or tampon hourly for more than two hours)\nIf you have other symptoms or are worried!\n\nIf you are still spotting after taking the pill or starting a new method of contraception for six months, speak to your doctor or nurse. They may suggest changing to another form of contraception, for example switching to a pill with a higher dose of oestrogen or one with a different progestogen formulation. \nThis blog can help you learn more about various contraception options, but it does not give medical advice. You should always speak to a nurse or doctor when making choices about contraception and before starting a new method.\nOne of The Lowdown’s fab Clinical Directors, Dr Frances Yarlett MBBCh (Hons) BSc (Hons) MRCP (2016) MRCGP DFSRH completed her medical training from Cardiff University in 2013. She is currently working as a salaried GP partner in Sheffield with an interest in complex medical patients and women’s health. Fran is really passionate about patient choice and wants to empower women to take control of their bodies and contraception needs.",

        "Title": "Antibiotics and The Pill: What’s The Truth?",
        "Content": "\nIt’s a tiny pill that packs a mighty contraceptive punch. But what happens when the pill and antibiotics interact? Let’s take a look at the effects of the antibiotics and birth control.\nThe routine nature of the pill means taking it daily can be a well-versed habit and a somewhat subconscious ritual. So much so that, if we find ourselves needing other medication, we often don’t even think of the pill as meds we are already taking. But it’s important to remember that just like any other drug, over the counter or prescription, there are always possibilities of interactions. Antibiotics are no exception and an unplanned pregnancy as a side effect is possibly one we’d rather avoid! So, it’s important to be clued up on the facts about antibiotics and birth control, and most importantly, the effects they can have on the pill’s ability to prevent pregnancy.\nWhat are antibiotics and why are they prescribed?\nAntibiotics are used in the treatment of bacterial infections. Generally speaking, they are prescribed for infections that are severe in nature, where there is a risk of more serious complications, in patients where symptoms are unlikely to improve on their own, or where there is a risk of infecting others. Antibiotics are not used to treat viral infections; for this they are ineffective.Antibiotics can be prescribed for many common conditions; persistent UTIs, acne, or genital herpes can all require their use. They can also be used as a preventative step where there is a future risk of infection. This can include certain types of surgery, such as the removal of the appendix or breast implant surgery, or a bite or wound that has a high chance of becoming infected. Less common illnesses, such as tuberculosis, will also use antibiotics in prevention and treatment.\nI’m taking antibiotics; will they affect my birth control pill?\nTo answer this we need to look a little more closely at the science. Rifampicin and rifabutin are two antibiotics known as enzyme-inducing antibiotics. This means they can increase the enzymes in your body. Subsequently, this increases the metabolism of oestrogens and progestogens, the hormones contained within the combined pill that work to prevent pregnancy. The result is a direct hit on its efficacy.All other antibiotics are non-enzyme-inducing, and these will not have any effect on the pill. There is no compromise in efficacy and no other precautions regarding contraception are required. The good news is most antibiotics commonly prescribed are non-enzyme-inducing, and your birth control pill will continue to work just fine. Phew!It is worth noting, however, that while these antibiotics may not directly impact the efficacy of the pill, other side effects may create issues. Antibiotics of any type can cause vomiting or severe diarrhoea. You may also be experiencing these symptoms due to the illness itself. If this happens, and you are sick within 2 hours of taking the pill, absorption of the contraceptive pill may be affected and it will be necessary to take another pill right away. Sickness or diarrhoea lasting more than 24 hours will impact the level of protection against pregnancy and it is important to remember the validity of the pill as a contraceptive cannot be guaranteed. Each day of sickness or diarrhoea should be counted as a missed pill day. If possible, try to continue to take your pills as normal and use condoms as an extra form of contraception.Whether you’re taking antibiotics or not, this information is important to remember. Vomiting with any cause, due to illness or as the result of an almighty hangover, can still impact the absorption of the pill!\nDo antibiotics affect the mini-pill?\nThe progestogen-only pill, or mini-pill, will be affected in the same way as the combined pill, as will the implant, patch and vaginal ring. Rifampicin or rifabutin – enzyme-inducing antibiotics – will compromise the efficacy of the mini-pill due to the increase in the metabolism of the progestogen. All other antibiotics (non-enzyme-inducing) will not affect the mini-pill.\nSo, my antibiotics are affecting my pill. What should I do?\nFirst off, don’t panic; there are multiple options available. Depending on personal preference and duration of the course of antibiotics, there are several choices. The progestogen-only injection, an intrauterine system (IUS), and an intrauterine device (IUD) are all unaffected by enzyme-inducing antibiotics. You can switch to one of these methods temporarily, or you may wish to make a change on a more permanent basis. The Lowdown’s contraception reviews are a great way to assess these alternatives and make an informed decision. With options to search for reviews based on side effects, both positive and negative, it’s an excellent way to access real-world responses to a variety of contraceptives. You can also find out more about switching contraception in this guide.Condoms are also an alternative that can be used alongside the pill. If you wish to continue using your current hormonal contraception and the course of antibiotics is less than 2 months, it is important to discuss this with your doctor. You may be advised to take the pill in a different way, whilst also using condoms.\nHow long do enzyme-inducing antibiotics affect the birth control pill?\nOnce you have completed the course of these antibiotics, you must continue to use an alternative contraceptive method for 28 days. You may wish to switch back to your previous method, but be sure to continue with a method unaffected by antibiotics for those full 4 weeks before doing so.\nCan you take the morning-after pill while on antibiotics?\nThe emergency contraceptive pills Levonelle and ellaOne both work to prevent pregnancy by stopping or delaying ovulation, the process in which an egg is released from the ovaries. For those taking commonly used antibiotics, the morning-after pills will work just fine. But, just as the combined pill, mini-pill and other hormonal contraceptives are affected by enzyme-inducing antibiotics, the morning-after pill will be, too. It’s not recommended that you use the morning-after pill if you are taking rifabutin or rifampicin, due to the impact on its ability to prevent pregnancy. There is, however, an alternative to the morning-after pill. An intrauterine device (IUD) can be used as a form of emergency contraception. This has no interaction with antibiotics and the IUD is actually more effective than emergency contraceptive pills, with less than 1% of women becoming pregnant whilst using the IUD.\nOne last thing about antibiotics and the birth control pill\nEnzyme-inducing antibiotics are not commonly prescribed. They are used in the treatment and prevention of tuberculosis and meningitis. Most antibiotics used for common conditions, such as chest infections or UTIs, will be non-enzyme-inducing and will therefore have no bearing on the efficacy of your contraception. Patient Information Leaflets (PIL) can be contradictory with their advice and may relay information that is outdated in regards to this issue. So, it’s important to remember which antibiotics will affect your birth control and the options available to you. If you are ever in doubt, speak with your doctor or pharmacist.\n",

        "Title": "Jaydess, Mirena, Kyleena, Benilexa or Levosert: which hormonal coil is best for me?",
        "Content": "\n\n\n \n If this blog sounds interesting, sign up to our newsletter for more:Despite it not being the most popular choice for your first method of contraception, many professionals would probably recommend the hormonal coil due to its effectiveness. When inserted, it is more than 99% effective plus you won’t have to think about it until it is removed. It’s also our highest rated method at The Lowdown.But which type of hormonal coil (aka intrauterine system or IUS) is best for you? In this blog, you’ll get the full lowdown on the Jaydess vs Mirena, the Kyleena vs Jaydess, the Levosert vs Mirena vs Benilexa and every other type of comparison possible.\nSo first up, what is the difference between the Mirena, Levosert, Benilexa, Kyleena and Jaydess coils?\nThe Jaydess, Kyleena, Mirena, Benilexa and Levosert coils all contain the hormone levonorgestrel (a form of progestogen). This is a synthetic form of the hormone progesterone, similar to the natural form produced by your ovaries. It helps to prevent pregnancy by thickening the cervical mucus – making it more difficult for sperm to move through the opening into the womb – and thinning the lining of the womb so a fertilised egg cannot implant and grow. The hormonal coil can also stop ovulation in some women.For contraception the Jaydess is licensed for use for up to three years, the Kyleena coil for up to 5 years; and Levosert, Benilexa and Mirena can be used for 8 years. If you have a Mirena, Benilexa or Levosert coil inserted over the age of 45, this can stay in for contraceptive use, for an entire 10 years until you are 55.Each coil is made from a small T-shaped frame. The Kyleena and Jaydess coils are slightly smaller than the Mirena, Benilexa and Levosert coils. The Kyleena and Jaydess both have a silver ring which means they can be identified more easily on ultrasound scans. If colour is your thing, whilst the Levosert, Benilexa and Kyleena have blue threads the Mirena and Jaydess have brown threads.For our friends across the pond, you can also choose the Skyla coil which is only available in the USA. It is most similar to Jaydess and can stay in for up to 3 years.\nMirenaLevosertBenilexaKyleenaJaydessSize (W x H)32 x 32 mm32 x 32 mm32 x 32 mm28 x 30 mm29 x 30 mmSize of inserter tube4.4 mm4.8 mm4.8 mm3.8 mm3.8 mmEffectiveness99%99%99%99%99%Licensed length of use8 years\n10 years if over 458 years\n10 years if over 458 years\n10 years if over 455 years3 yearsInitial dose of levonorgestrel hormone per 24h20mcg20.1mcg20.1mcg17.5mcg14mcgDose of levonorgestrel hormone per 24hr at end of coil’s license9mcg8.6mcg8.6mcg7.4mcg5mcgHelps withHeavy menstrual bleeding\nPeriod pain\nMenopause\nAdenomyosis\nEndometriosis\nHRTHeavy menstrual bleeding\nPeriod pain\nAdenomyosis\nEndometriosis\nHRTHeavy menstrual bleeding\nPeriod pain\nAdenomyosis\nEndometriosis\nHRTHeavy menstrual bleedingHeavy menstrual bleedingExpected number of users who will have spotting in the first 3 months51%51%51%57%39-55%Expected number of users who will have spotting after 3 months of use10%10%10%14%14-19%Expected number of users who will stop having periods by 1 year20%20%20%12%6-9%\nData sourced from FSRH and The Lowdown user reviews\nWhat are the benefits of the different hormonal coils?\nContraception aside, the Mirena, Benilexa and Levosert coils are also used in the management of heavy periods as they tend to make periods lighter. These 3 coils can also be used as part of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), a treatment used to manage the symptoms of menopause. The Mirena, Benilexa and Levosert coils may help to reduce pain associated periods, endometriosis and adenomyosis.There is some evidence that shows the Kyleena and Jaydess coils reduce menstrual bleeding but neither are currently licensed for the treatment of heavy periods. This may be because they have slightly lower levels of progestogen so the impact on heavy bleeding isn’t quite as substantial.\nHow are each of the hormonal coils fitted?\nA hormonal coil can be fitted at any time in your menstrual cycle as long as you are not pregnant or at risk of pregnancy. If it’s fitted in the first five days of your cycle, you will be protected against pregnancy right away. If fitted at any other time you should use additional contraception such as condoms for 7 days after fitting.Having an IUS fitted can be uncomfortable, and some people might find it painful, but you can have a local anaesthetic to help. Check out our full guide to coil fittings to find out more on what to expect and what pain relief options are available to you.The hormonal coils all have the same insertion process:\n\nAn appointment takes around 15 – 20 minutes and fitting the coil normally takes no longer than five\nThe vagina is held open – like it is during a smear test – and the coil is inserted through the cervix (the neck of the womb) and then into the womb\nYour doctor or nurse will teach you how to feel for the threads that extend from the coil, through the cervix and into the vagina (only a couple of centimetres!)\n\nChecking these threads regularly lets you know the coil is in place. If you can’t feel the threads the coil may not be in place and you may not be protected from pregnancy. In this case contact your nurse or doctor to see if you need emergency contraception and use an additional method such as condoms. Learn how to check for coil threads here.After a coil is inserted, you should take it easy, invest in a hot water bottle and use painkillers if you feel any discomfort.It is possible, but unlikely, to have an infection after getting the coil fitted. These occur most commonly around 3 weeks after the insertion. Symptoms include pain in your lower abdomen, a high temperature and a smelly discharge. In this case, contact your doctor urgently or return to the clinic where your coil was fitted for an assessment and antibiotic treatment. \nMirena vs Jaydess vs Kyleena vs Levosert vs Benilexa: side effects\nNow you know the technical ins and outs of the hormonal coils, it’s time to talk side effects. Scientifically speaking, each of the five brands has the same listed side effects. But what do the people who’ve had them say?Below we’ve included some stats from our 6,000+ Lowdown user reviews that share an insight into real people’s experiences of the hormonal coils. You can also check out our Hormonal IUS page to see our reviewer data in depth for yourself. If you’re interested in a particular brand of contraception, take a look at the Kyleena, Levosert and Jaydess side effects.\nThe IUS coil and acne\nFor the Jaydess coil, 45% of reviewers at the time of writing had no impact on their skin and for the Mirena, 43% said the same. 56% of respondents said the Kyleena coil increased their acne.\nThe IUS coil and moods\n47% of women said they felt no change in their moods when on the Jaydess, similar to 40% using the Kyleena and 44% with the Mirena. 33% of Levosert users also reported no change.\nThe IUS coil and periods\nA third (33%) of women said their periods stopped with the Jaydess coil, with a further 27% experiencing lighter bleeds. A higher 53% said the Mirena coil stopped theirs, with a reduced 15% experiencing irregular periods.With the Kyleena, 33% of women said their periods stopped completely. Whilst 40% of those with the Levosert reported lighter bleeds.\nThe IUS coil and sex drive\nWhat about your sex drive people? Well luckily, the majority of respondents felt there was no change in their sex drive – aka horniness – on all the coils. For Jaydess, 61% said there was no change to their libido and 45% said the same for Mirena.However, whilst two-fifths (45%) of Kyleena users said there was no change in their sex drive, a third (29%) said lost their sex drive. 29% said they felt a decrease in sex drive whilst using the Jaydess coil and again the same percentage (29%) agreed for the Mirena. It is however important to recognise the complex number of factors that can influence our libido – get the guide to contraception and sex drive here.\nThe IUS coil and weight gain\nIn terms of weight gain, over half (57%) of participants said there was no change on the Mirena, compared to 68% who said the same for the Jaydess. Likewise, the majority (61%) of reviewers said the same for the Kyleena coil. Good times.We’ve recently added the Skyla and Benilexa coils to our list of birth control methods at The Lowdown. If you’re a Skyla or Benilexa user, please leave a review of your experiences to help other women across the globe.\nWhat do the reviews say?\nBelow is a selection of our real-life user reviews for each brand of coil…\nJaydess reviews\n“My periods became very irregular- would stop for 3-4 months then be very light for 10 days or so which I found annoying. Other than that it was great! I asked for local anaesthetic when they put it in too which made it a lot less painful.”“I had the Jaydess inserted after a good experience with the Mirena coil. it was a huge mistake for me. I didn’t stop bleeding for 3 months and just generally felt awful. My gyno recommended taking it out as it turned out I had an infection that wouldn’t clear up with antibiotics and my vagina has never been the same since. It gets really dry, sensitive and I suffer from dermatitis/eczema. It also caused me to have a cyst which then burst and bled into itself. Once I had the Jaydess removed the infection cleared up as well as the cyst but I still suffer from awful eczema.”“Best contraception I’ve ever used. Minor side effects, lighter periods with very little pain, better skin, no weight gain, no worries – what’s not to love about it? Have mine in 2 years and will be getting a new one immediately after this one comes out.”Read more Jaydess coil reviews\nMirena reviews \n“Would have been great but pretty sure it’s the reason I have had chronic thrush!”“It was painful to put in, and I had cramping occasionally (a few times a month) for quite a while afterwards. I had 9 months of irregular bleeding (light spotting), but now no bleeding at all, and that is wonderful. No side effects at all apart from the bleeding initially. Amazing alternative to remembering pills.”“I got this when I was 25 y/o after 7 years of the implant on and off, which caused bleeding. I decided to get the Mirena because the other options were exhausted (I can’t take the pill for medical reasons). I can’t lie, getting it put in did hurt – a lot – but it hurt for about 20 seconds. Before anyone tells you how painful it is, it IS worth it. After having it put in, I was fine at first and then had mild bleeding and cramps for about a week. Since then, my periods have completely stopped. I occasionally have mild bleeding after sex but I think this is unrelated. I saw a doctor at the hospital recently and she saw my Mirena on a scan, she asked me about it and then said “The Mirena has changed my life” and I can’t disagree. I had it checked by a nurse about 3 months later because I was worried that it might have moved but all is good. I’m now 8 months in and it’s amazing – I get VERY occasional, VERY mild cramps but other than that, it’s changed my life.”Read more Mirena coil reviews\nKyleena reviews\n“I found fitting extremely painful, but the worst bit was very fast – so only intense pain for like 10 seconds. I had pretty heavy bleeding for a few days after fitting and then a more painful/heavy period the month after and then since that have basically not had a period. I didn’t notice any change in mood, but boobs have got bigger and I’ve put some weight on (although that could be due to lockdown!). I found I got cramping for about 6 weeks after fitting, not constant but they were very uncomfortable for the first few weeks. Overall really pleased with it, worth the discomfort at the start for what will hopefully be 5 years of not having to worry about contraception!”“All I will say with this one is give it 6 months to settle down! I had quite sore breasts on and off for the first 3 months and after the first 3 months developed quite bad acne. With an adjustment to my skin routine and 3 months of patience, it’s virtually back to normal! Get the odd cramp every now and then but virtually never have periods (and if I do, they’re very light and last 1-2 days) but has settled down massively. My sex drive also returned from 5 years on the combined pill and reduced my mood swings – overall I would recommend it despite the hiccups!”“The first month I got my coil fitted I experienced spotting every day. Three days before my period was due I had an ongoing headache that ended up me being sent home from work in tears So far I haven’t experienced any acne or mood changes but am still feeling sceptical.”Read more Kyleena reviews\nLevosert reviews\n“Really painful during insertion but settled within 2 days. Some cramps now and again and spots on my face have increased, also experienced some on my back which I’ve never had before. Some spotting and first few weeks had a light bleed. Now periods are a lot lighter. However, it can be felt slightly during sex.”“I’ve had the coil fitted for 2 months now. I had it fitted on my period which I think helped make the process relatively easy. Some cramping for a couple of days afterwards, but mostly no major symptoms. My first period was on time and very veryyyy light (pantiliner only). Second period came on time, but feels heavier this time – still considered light but need a pad now. Still adjusting to it all.”“After years of different methods, I chose the IUS after my third child as I wanted something long term without me having to remember something every day. Aside from increased acne, which has been a fair amount, I am happy with the IUS and would get it again. After speaking with the nurse practitioner, she assures me the acne will calm down.”Read more Levosert reviews\nSo which IUS is best for you?\nWe’re all different – which means there’s no simple answer to which is the best brand of coil for you.

        "Content": "\n\nFirstly, there are two types of contraceptive pill:\nCombined pill\n(Examples include Yasmin, Rigevidon and Levest)\nThe combined pill is a hormonal contraceptive pill taken daily, either with a break of up to a week every 3 weeks or continuously to avoid withdrawal bleeds. It contains the hormones oestrogen and progestogen.\nProgestogen-only pill (POP)\n(Examples include Aizea, Cerelle and Zelleta)\nThe progestogen-only pill is also a daily hormonal contraceptive, but unlike the combined pill, it only contains one hormone – progestogen – and packets are taken back to back with no breaks. \n\nHow effective is the birth control pill?\nWhen assessing how effective a contraceptive method is we look at typical and perfect use. At the Lowdown, we have created an easy guide on the clinical effectiveness of different contraceptives to help you to find the most effective option.  \nIf we look at 100 sexually active pill users for a year, with perfect use less than 1 will get pregnant. But if we look at typical use, around 7 will get pregnant during that year.\nSo in answer to the question… Yes, you can get pregnant on the birth control pill, even when using it perfectly.\nIn comparison to other contraceptives, the contraceptive pill is more effective than barrier methods like the condom or diaphragm but less effective than long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) such as the implant or the coil.\nWhat happens if you miss a pill?\nIf you miss a pill there are certain actions you must take. This gets a little bit complicated and depends on whether you are on the progestogen-only pill or the combined pill. It also depends on what type of each pill you are on too!\nThe Lowdown have created a one-of-a-kind missed pill calculator tool based on FSRH Guidance, which takes all the guesswork and panic out of missing a pill! It also offers clear advice on whether you should consider accessing emergency contraception. If you’re using the drospirenone POP, we’re working on incorporating this into our missed pill calculator but in the meantime check the manufacturer’s leaflet for advice. \n\nHow do I change the time I take my pill?\nIf you want to change the time you take your pill, we’ve written a handy guide about how to change the timing of your pill which explains the ‘safe windows’ for pill taking. This is helpful if you want to change time of day or are travelling to different time zones.\nWhat medications interfere with the pill?\nCertain types of medication can make the pill less effective. Certain antibiotics can affect the pill, such a rifampicin, and anti-fungal drugs, such as griseofulvin. Whilst on these medications you should use backup contraception as well for 48 after finishing the course. \nOther more long-term medications and supplements may also affect how well contraceptive pills work:\n\nEpilepsy drugs such as phenobarbital, phenytoin and carbamazepine\nAntiviral medications used to treat HIV \nSt. John’s Wort, which is a herbal remedy\n\nWhat can cause the birth control pill to be less effective?\nMissing days \nThe pill should be taken daily for it to be most effective and therefore if you miss a day, your hormone levels may not remain consistent enough to prevent pregnancy. If you struggle to remember to take a birth control pill every day, other contraceptive methods may suit you better – check out our reviews from users to see which one is best for you. \nNot taking the pill at the same time each day\nThe contraceptive pill is designed to be taken at or around the same time each day to ensure that it can maintain hormone levels. Certain traditional progestogen-only pills suchs as Noriday or Micronor have a strict 3 hour window to take the pill in each day, desogestrel containing POPs such as Cerelle or Cerazette have a 12 hour window to take it in, where as drospirenone containing POPs have a 24 hour window .\nNot starting a new pack straight away\nIf you are using the combined pill and having breaks, it is essential that you do not have longer than a 7 day break as this can lead to ovulation which in turn can lead to pregnancy. With the progestogen-only pill there needs to be no break at all between pill packets. For the drospirenone POP there are 24 active pills and 4 placebo (sugar or dummy) pills in each packet, meaning there’s a built in hormone free break.\nVomiting\nIf you happen to become ill when taking the pill and vomit, the pill may not be fully absorbed by the gut. If you do experience vomiting within 3 to 4 hours of taking your pill, you should take another birth control pill as soon as possible then take your next pill as usual. This also applies if you have severe watery diarrhoea soon after taking a pill. If the replacement pill is not taken within the safe window for that pill you may need to take extra precautions. Check out our missed pill calculator tool if you’re not sure.\nPoor absorption\nIf you have had an operation involving the gut such as bariatric surgery it may interfere with absorption of the contraceptive pill so other methods that don’t need to be absorbed through the stomach might be better. \nHow to help make the pill as effective as possible\n\nTry to find a habit or routine in your day where you can take your pill, for example whenever you brush your teeth before bed\nOrder your pill prescription early if you get it from your GP. Don’t leave it until the day that you need it as can’t always be processed\nReading the packaging and following the instructions carefully\nTry to take the pill at the same time every day\nUsing an app that tracks periods and provides pill reminders, check out MyPill® and MyOC.\nAlways get a new pill pack at least 1 week before the pill pack is due to run out\nAlways take missed pills as soon as possible and check up to date guidance from NHS or use our handy missed pill calculator\n\n\n \n\n\n\nMaddie is an English Language and Linguistics graduate who is passionate about writing.

        "Title": "The contraceptive implant: common side effects and reviews­",
        "Content": "\nThere are so many types of contraceptives it can be hard to know which one is best for you. Experiences differ from person to person and it’s always good to read real user experiences.\nIn this post, we’re looking at the contraceptive implant and sharing our data on the most common side effects as experienced by over 3000 real people.\nWhat is the birth control implant?\nThe contraceptive implant (Nexplanon implant) is a small soft flexible rod made out of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer (plastic) that goes under your skin. It releases a hormone called progestogen that works to prevent pregnancy. It lasts for three years before it should be replaced.\nHow does the contraceptive implant work?\nOnce placed under the skin of your upper arm by a doctor or nurse, it releases the hormone progestogen gradually into your bloodstream which works to prevent pregnancy in three ways: by stopping ovulation, making the fluid in your cervix thicker (making it more difficult from sperm to enter the womb), and preventing the lining of your womb thickening enough for an embryo to grow in it.\nHow effective is the contraceptive implant?\nIt is 99% effective, meaning that the chances of getting pregnant on the implant are fewer than 1 out of 100 women over the course of a year. \nWhat are the most common contraceptive implant side effects?\n\nSpots or acne\nTender breasts\nVaginal discharge\nHeadaches\nMood changes\nChanges in sex drive\n\nHowever these symptoms often settle after a few months.\nChanges in your periods are common. These can include spotting or irregular bleeding, prolonged bleeding or your periods may stop altogether. Around 20% of women can expect to have no periods and 30% of women less than 1 period a month.\nBecause of how it works the implant may actually help to reduce period pain, pain related to ovulation and heavy periods.\nWomen have also reported other possible side effects but the lack of research into this area means we don’t have scientific evidence that links these to the implant. For example there is no scientific evidence that the implant causes weight gain. Research does admit that women can put on weight while using the implant but this is thought to be due to natural weight gain as part of ageing that would happen normally without contraception.\nCheck out some of our user’s contraceptive implant reviews:\n\n“Excellent for the first 3 years, not having to think about it at all was the biggest selling point to me, but now after almost 6 years – with acne, weight gain and mood swings I’m wondering if it’s time to try something else.”\n\n\n“I really like the implant. Basically having no periods is great and cheap! Haven’t noticed any negative side effects. Getting it put in was easy, having it changed was a bit weird but fine. A tiny bit annoying there is 2 small scars on my arm now.”\n\n\n“After a year and a half of the implant, I’m getting recurrent thrush and my moods are frequently low. Periods finally started again but were very heavy and irregular. Sex drive is totally gone. Not fantastic but no acne and I got a year and a half without periods.”\n\nRemoval of the contraceptive implant\nTo remove the contraceptive implant you will need to go back to your heathcare provider – DO NOT attempt to take it out yourself.\nThe procedure is normally fairly simple and should only take a few minutes. As soon as it’s removed you won’t be protected from pregnancy. You will have a local anaesthetic injection, then the doctor or nurse will make a tiny cut in your skin and gently pull the implant out. They will put a dressing on the arm to keep it clean and dry and reduce any bruising.\nCheck out some of our reviews regarding the contraceptive implant removal:\n\n“My first implant insertion went well and better than expected. However, I went to have it renewed and they had to remove, create a new incision and insert into a new area. My arm looks awful and is very bruised. I expected a little but not as much as this. I won’t be getting this inserted again as the procedure is a little much for me. Although I will say as a contraceptive it has been effective and any side effects have been bearable.”“I really like the implant. Basically having no periods is great and cheap! Haven’t noticed any negative side effects. Getting it put in was easy, having it changed was a bit weird but fine. A tiny bit annoying there are two small scars on my arm now.”\n\n\n\nFaculty of Sexual and Reproductive Health (FSRH)\n\n\nFamily Planning Association (FPA)\n\n\nMaddie is an English Language and Linguistics graduate who is passionate about writing.

        "Title": "Is Microgynon the right pill for you?",
        "Content": "\n✅ If you think you’ll find this interesting, check our our newsletter for more!\nFinding the right contraceptive method for you can be challenging and it can feel confusing knowing where to start. Some women find the right contraceptive method straight away whilst others have to trial lots of different options to find the right match.Microgynon is one of the most well known brands of combined contraceptive pills but it has the same hormones as other contraceptives pills such as Rigevidon, Levest and Ovranette.  These combined pills tend to be the first type offered by healthcare professionals when starting a combined pill as they have lowest risk of blood clots.\nWhat is Microgynon?\nThe hormones in Microgynon, Rigevidon, Levest and Ovranette are oestrogen (ethinylestradiol) and progestogen (levonorgestrel). All combined pills prevent pregnancy by stopping ovulation, making the fluid in your cervix thicker and preventing the lining of your womb from thickening. Traditionally with Microgynon you take one pill a day for 21 days and then have a 7 day break. However you have the option to shorten or avoid the break and take your pill continuously. You can buy the Microgynon pill here at The Lowdown\nWhat is Microgynon ED?\nFor those who want to take a pill every day for ease, there is also a Microgynon 30 ED (every day) pill which consists of seven dummy pills, which are a different colour from the other 21. The dummy pills represent the break week when you have a withdrawal bleed.This makes it more difficult to use continuously or back to back  (you would have to omit the dummy pills) which is a useful way to avoid periods and period related problems.\nHow effective is Microgynon?\nWhen we look at how effective a contraceptive method is we look at typical and perfect use. At the Lowdown, we have come up with an easy guide about different contraceptives to help you to find the most effective option.  If we look at 100 sexually active women taking this type of pill for a year, with perfect use less than 1 will get pregnant but if we look at typical use 7 women will get pregnant during that year. It is important to think about how good you will be at remembering to take a pill every day when you are choosing which contraceptive method is best for you. There are now apps available to help you remember to take your pill. We recommend taking your pill when you do something routinely every day like brushing your teeth to help build the habit.\nSide effects of Microgynon\nAs with all contraceptive methods, women may experience a range of different side effects or none at all. The below side effects are some of the most frequently reported from users of Microgynon;\n\nTender breasts (52%)\nVaginal discharge (52%)\nEnlarged breasts (43%)\nPeriod like cramping (41%)\nVaginal dryness (38%)\n\nTake a look at our Microgynon side effects page to see what users of Microgynon said about changes to their mood, bleeding, sex drive, and weight. You can also check out our reviews page for stories about how other users got on with Microgynon.\nRisks of taking Microgynon\nOne rare but serious risk of the combined pill is blood clots, this includes deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. The risk of blood clots is highest when you first start a combined contraceptive, mainly as it might highlight an underlying blood clotting problem that you may have or be due to hormonal change to proteins in your blood.. It is also important that if you have a long period of immobility such as after a major operation or on a long-haul flight, be aware of increased risk of blood clots.While the risk is very low, look out for the symptoms of a blood clot. These include stabbing pains or swelling in one leg, pain on breathing or coughing, coughing up blood, sudden breathlessness or chest pain.The combined pill may also increase your blood pressure so you will need to have this checked before you are prescribed the pill and normally once a year whilst using it. Use of the combined pill is also associated with small increased risks of breast cancer and cervical cancer which reduce with time after stopping. For more information about the range of combined pills available have a look at our Lowdown page.\n",

        "Title": "How do I delay my period?",
        "Content": "\nEach month Mother Nature hands us a red notice to remind us that we’ve completed another month of not being pregnant. And whether you like it or not, she’ll be coming back for a while.\nWhether you’re off on holiday or you just can’t face the cramps that month, you may want to delay your period. Yes – it is possible!\nThis handy guide covers ways to adapt how you take the combined pill to avoid a period, as well as period-delaying medications and contraceptives that can stop or decrease heavy periods for most people.\n✅ If you think you’ll enjoy this blog, make sure to check out our newsletter for more:\n\nThe combined pill\nIf you take the combined contraceptive pill, you can delay your period by taking two packets back to back. However, how you do this will be determined by which pill you take – so be sure to check first!\nMonophasic 21-day pills (e.g. Microgynon, Cilest, Gedarel)\nYou take a combined pill for 21 days, followed by seven days without pills, and it’s within these seven days that you have a withdrawal bleed like a period. However to avoid having a bleed you can start a new packet of pills straight after you finish the last pill to miss out the seven day break. This is continuous or back-to-back pill taking and is a safe way to avoid a withdrawal bleed.\nEveryday Pill (ED) (e.g. Microgynon ED and Femodene ED)\nThese every day (ED) pills include 21 active pills and 7 pills are inactive (or dummy pills). To avoid the withdrawal bleed, miss out the dummy pills, and start the active pills in a new packet straight away.\nPhasic 21 day pills (e.g. Qlaira and Logyon)\nThe mix of hormones in each pill is different, depending on which phase you’re in. You need to take these pills in the correct order to have effective contraception. We don’t advise using these types of pill back-to-back.\nIt’s reassuring to know that taking your contraceptive pills as above will not affect how they work as contraceptives, so you will still be protected. In fact, taking your combined pill back to back may be more effective. If you are unsure which pill you are on, speak to your pharmacist or GP.\nPeriod delay tablets\nIf you are wanting to delay your period, and you are not on the combined contraceptive pill, then you will need to speak to your GP or pharmacist. They could prescribe you a medication called norethisterone which contains a synthetic progestogen hormone.\nYou will normally be prescribed one tablet three times a day of norethisterone, starting three days before you expect your period to begin and your period should arrive two to three days after you stop taking the medication. Sometimes your period may be heavier after delaying it using these types of tablets.\nNorethisterone is normally safe to take but for some people who have risk factors for deep vein thrombosis then an alternative called Provera (medroxyprogesterone) will be prescribed.  \nIt’s important to note that norethisterone does NOT act as a contraceptive when used in this way, so you will need to make sure you’re protected in other ways. \nSome side effects of norethisterone can include:\n\nBreast tenderness\nNausea\nHeadaches\nChanges in mood and sex drive\n\nWhich contraception can reduce periods or stop them?\nCertain forms of contraception, such as the injection or the hormonal coil, are known to make periods lighter or stop them altogether (of course, this isn’t the case for everyone). Some people find that their periods are lighter or stop altogether with the progestogen-only contraceptive pill or implant, but it can vary. Some people even have the opposite effect with spotting throughout their cycle.\nIf you want to delay your period each month, it might be worth looking into a different contraceptive that may do this.\n\n\nBNF.

        "Title": "Female sterilisation &#8211; fact vs fiction",
        "Content": "\nFemale sterilisation, which is also known as ‘having your tubes tied’, is a permanent surgical procedure to block or seal a woman’s fallopian tubes (which carry the egg from the ovaries to the womb). It works by preventing an egg from reaching the sperm. Eggs will still be released, but they’ll be absorbed naturally into the body.\nFemale sterilisation is normally done through the NHS. The procedure involves the surgeon making a small cut near your belly button (laproscopy) and inserting a long, thin instrument called a laparoscope that has a camera (to help the doctor see). The tubes are then blocked by applying clips or rings, or by tying, cutting or removing a small piece of the tube.\nIt’s important to know that sterilisation is incredibly difficult to reverse and this, as well as other more effective contraceptive options should be thoroughly considered beforehand. (Yes that’s right – the implant and the hormonal coil are both more effective than female sterilisation at preventing pregnancy. Check out our page on contraceptive effectiveness explained to find out more). If you have a partner it’s important you discuss your options beforehand and ideally you should both agree to the procedure. The male vasectomy is also an option to consider. This may be preferred as it’s simpler, safer and cheaper. This form of contraception is also 99% effective.\nFiction: sterilisation causes cancer\nIt’s often thought that sterilisation for women can cause cancer in the reproductive organs (uterus, cervix and ovaries) but…\nFact:\nFemale sterilisation does not increase the risk of cancer. Little research has been done to investigate the relationship between breast cancer and female sterilisation, but there is absolutely no evidence to support this.\nFiction: only certain women can undergo sterilisation\nSome women may avoid sterilisation as an option because they believe that only women of a certain age or that have a certain number of children can undergo female sterilisation.\nFact:\nAll women can have female sterilisation, no matter what age. However it should only be considered by women who do not want any more children or do not want children at all. Your GP may suggest you have counselling before coming to this decision and will want to be happy this decision is in your best interests.\nFiction: females no longer ovulate after sterilisation\nIt’s thought that female sterilisation prevents pregnancy either by stopping ovulation or by killing a woman’s egg.\nFact:\nIt does not in fact stop ovulation or harm a woman’s eggs. An egg will still be released each month, but will instead dissolve and be reabsorbed by the body (how clever!).\nFiction: women who have sterilisation lose their sex drive\nPeople often think that this procedure will cause a loss of sex drive.\nFact:\nAfter sterilisation nothing will change sexually in the female. The female will be able to have sex the same as before and may even find it more enjoyable as they don’t need to worry about pregnancy, condoms or other contraception. 67% of women who reviewed their sterilization journey on The Lowdown stated they experienced no change in their sex drive.\nFiction: ALL of a woman’s reproductive organs will be removed in the operation\nIt would be false to think that female sterilisation involves the removal of some or all of a female’s reproductive organs – some people even think this includes removal of the vagina itself (ouch!)\nFact:\nDuring the operation, ovaries, uterus and cervix all remain in the same place as they were before. The only organs affected are the Fallopian tubes, which are blocked or cut. \nFiction: there are lots of health risks and side effects when undergoing female sterilisation\nA common myth is that female sterilisation leads to major health risks or side effects, such as hysterectomy, poor health, pain and changes in menstrual bleeding or hormonal imbalances.\nFact:\nThere are no documented medical side effects after female sterilisation. The few surgical complications that do occur during or after sterilisation, such as a wound infection, can generally be kept to a minimum by good after care. Research has found no major changes in menstrual bleeding patterns after female sterilisation.  One of the Lowdown users reported that they ‘ have had no long-lasting effects.’\nWhilst there are still a lot of myths surrounding female sterilisation and what the procedure actually involves, this effective but permanent method of contraception is actually quite popular with The Lowdown community. If you’ve undergone female sterilisation we’ve love to hear from you!\n\nNHS UK\n\nMaddie is an English Language and Linguistics graduate who is passionate about writing.

        "Title": "Contraceptive implant &#8211; a guide to fitting and removal",
        "Content": "\nWith the contraceptive implant (Nexplanon) needing to be fitted under the skin in your arm, it can feel like one of the more daunting contraceptives to get on board with.\nBut whilst the implant may seem an initially uncomfortable way to protect yourself from pregnancy, it’s a highly effective (over 99%) long-term contraceptive solution which can be removed at any time if causing side effects (check out our reviewers’ real experiences and side effects). \nWith questions around the implant removal and fitting often front-of-mind when exploring this type of contraception, we’ve pulled together a detailed guide on what to expect for this procedure.\nThe contraceptive implant at a glance\n\nThe implant is a small matchstick sized rod that is inserted into the arm\nThe brand used in the UK is called Nexplanon\nThe implant works by steadily releasing the hormone progestogen into your bloodstream, which prevents the release of an egg each month. It also thickens the cervical mucus, preventing sperm from getting through, and thins the lining of the womb so a fertilised egg cannot implant into it\nThe implant is over 99% effective at preventing pregnancy. \nThe contraceptive implant only needs to be replaced every three years\nThe implant can be removed at any time if it is causing side effects\nIt is safe to use whilst breastfeeding\nWhere the implant is inserted it may feel bruised for a week or two after\nYou can resume daily activities immediately after the implant has been fitted\nThe implant may cause irregular bleeding, infrequent bleeding, spotting, prolonged periods or stop your periods altogether. The pattern of bleeding tends to settle down after 3 to 6 months\nThe implant can be fitted at any time during your cycle as long as you’re not pregnant. If fitted in the first 5 days of your cycle you are protected against pregnancy straight away. If fitted at any other time within your cycle you will need to use condoms for the first 7 days\nThe implant may cause side effects such as acne, breast tenderness, headaches and mood changes\nYou are no longer protected from pregnancy as soon as the implant is removed and your fertility will return to what is normal for you\n\nHaving the contraceptive implant fitted – your questions answered\nHow large is the contraceptive implant?\nThe implant is approximately 4cm long, which is roughly the size of a matchstick.\nWhere is the implant fitted on my body?\nThe contraceptive implant is fitted just under the skin on the inside of your upper arm. It will usually be inserted in your non-dominant arm (i.e. if you’re right handed it will be inserted in your left arm). \nWill it hurt when it’s inserted in my arm?\nBefore the contraceptive implant is fitted you will be given a local anaesthetic which will numb the area. The implant is then inserted under the skin.\nHow long will the Nexplanon implant take to be fitted?\nThe contraceptive implant is very quick to be fitted, and should only take a few minutes to be inserted. \nWill my arm hurt after the implant has been inserted?\nOnce the local anaesthetic has worn off you may experience some tenderness in your arm for a couple of days after. \nWill I need stitches in my arm after the implant has been inserted?\nNo stitches are required for this procedure. \nHow do I know that the Nexplanon implant has been inserted correctly?\nImmediately after insertion your healthcare provider will feel to check that it has been inserted correctly and teach you to do the same. If at any time following the insertion you cannot feel the implant, then contact your healthcare provider and use extra contraceptive precautions (such as condoms) until they have checked that it is in place. \nCan I have the implant fitted if I’m pregnant? \nThe contraceptive implant cannot be fitted if you are pregnant. Your healthcare professional may ask you to do a pregnancy test prior to insertion to ensure that you are not pregnant before your fitting. \nWill I need any aftercare?\nThe area of your arm where the implant is fitted will be covered with a dressing and a bandage. You should keep the site dry and clean for 24-48 hours post insertion. \nWill having the implant fitted affect my periods?\nYes, many women find a change in their periods once they have the implant fitted. This could include spotting or lighter periods, as well as irregular or infrequent bleeding. A common side effect is that your periods may stop altogether. This is not harmful and potentially very beneficial, especially if you have heavy or painful periods.\nCan I get my contraceptive implant fitted on the NHS?\nAbsolutely. You can have it fitted at contraceptive clinics, sexual health clinics, some GP surgeries, and some young people’s services. Find a sexual health clinic. \nIs it free to have the implant fitted?\nYes all NHS services that fit contraceptive implants will fit it for free.\nCan I have the implant fitted by a private clinic?\nYes, there are multiple private clinics offering implant fittings. The cost for the implant to be fitted is approximately £300, but will vary from clinic to clinic. \nContraceptive implant removal – your questions answered\nWhen can I have the implant removed?\nYou can have your implant removed at any time by a health professional. Your implant may be about to expire, you may be experiencing side effects, or you may wish to get pregnant. If you do not wish to get pregnant consider switching to another method of contraception before having your implant removed, or avoid unprotected sex in the 7 days before the implant is removed. Once the implant is removed you can get pregnant and your fertility will return to what is normal for you.\nIf I’m experiencing no implant side effects, how long until I need my contraception replaced?\nYour implant can stay in place in your arm for three years before it needs to be replaced. \nHow is the implant removed from my arm?\nThe healthcare professional will feel for your implant before they remove it. A local anaesthetic will then be administered, and a tiny cut will be made in your skin to pull the implant out.\nDoes implant removal hurt?\nRemoval will be relatively painless as your health professional will have administered a local anaesthetic. \nHow long does it take for the implant to be removed?\nIt usually only takes a few minutes for the implant to be removed by your healthcare professional. \nIs there a risk of infection after contraceptive implant removal?\nIn very rare cases the site of the implant may become infected. If the skin becomes red, painful or swollen or you feel unwell, contact your doctor. \nWill I experience any bruising on my arm after the removal?\nYou may experience slight bruising and tenderness after the removal. This should go down after a few days. \nWill I get a scar on my arm once the implant has been removed?\nIn most cases you will not be left with a noticeable scar. \nCan I get pregnant once the implant has been removed?\nYes your normal fertility will return on removal of the implant and it is possible to get pregnant as soon as the implant has been removed. If you do not wish to get pregnant we recommend using condoms or switching to another method of contraception. \nIs it dangerous if I go past the three year life span of my implant before getting it removed?\nIt is not dangerous to keep the implant in, but it will be less effective which will increase the risk of pregnancy. To maintain contraceptive cover you should have your implant replaced after three years. During the Covid-19 pandemic the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Health (FSRH) advised that whilst the risk of pregnancy during the fourth year of use appears to be very low, contraception cannot be guaranteed and women may wish to use additional contraceptive precautions until they are able to attend an appointment for their Nexplanon replacement.\nSide effects of the contraceptive implant (Nexplanon)\n\nLonger or shorter bleeding during your period\nLighter or infrequent periods\nSpotting between your periods\nIrregular periods (48% of our reviewers stated this as a side effect)\nNo periods at all \nMood changes\nWeight changes\nBreast tenderness\nHeadaches\nIncreased spots or acne\nChange in sex drive (53% of our reviewers stated a reduction in sex drive as a side effect)\n\nFor further information on side effects and risks, see our complete guide and reviews of the contraceptive implant.

        "Title": "Can precum cause pregnancy? What are the chances?",
        "Content": "\nYou’ve probably been taught to put a condom on a banana (or cucumber), what methods of contraception there are or what happens when we menstruate but getting pregnant from pre-cum? Not likely.If you’ve considered using the pull-out – or withdrawal method – as a form of contraception, then you might also want to think about the possibility of pre-cum entering the vagina. Here, The Lowdown answers the much confused question of whether you can get pregnant from pre-cum and how effective the use of the pull-out method is.👀 If you think you’ll find this blog interesting, make sure to check out our newsletter for more:\nCan you get pregnant from pre-cum – and what even is it?\nNow, pre-cum, or pre-ejaculation, is fluid that is discharged from a penis when it is aroused and usually occurs right before ejaculation. The fluid can act as a natural lubricant during sex.\nTo quickly answer the question you’ve all been waiting for – can pre-cum cause pregnancy? – the chances are very slim (touch wood, pun not intended). But if you don’t want to get pregnant – it’s best to avoid the risk during ovulation or any time during your cycle.\nPre-cum does not only occur in the moments just before orgasm. Some males might produce more pre-cum than others and at different times during penetrative sex.\nDoes pre-cum contain sperm cells? \nMany people also believe – and are told – that pre-cum does not contain any sperm. They are right but, before you get too excited, sperm has the potential to leak into pre-cum before it makes its way into the vagina, the cheeky bugger. Semen can linger in the urethra after ejaculation and mix with pre-cum while on its way out.\nIn a 2016 study conducted from the National Library of Medicine, 17% of sperm was found in pre-cum. Then in another study published in 2011, mobile sperm was found in 37% of pre-cum samples given by 27 men.\nCan I get pregnant even if I’m not ovulating? \nAgain, yes. Although pregnancy is most likely to occur during ovulation (which you can learn to track yourself using cycle apps), sperm can live inside your body for as long as five days. If it’s in the reproductive tract at ovulation, those guys might be able to fertilise an egg.\nWhat is the pull-out or withdrawal method?\nDoctors in the UK advise against the withdrawal method as a method of contraception on its own. The idea behind this method relies on the penis being all the way out of the vagina before ejaculation and ejaculation occurring away from the vagina or vulva.But this doesn’t take into account issues with achieving this or the existence of pre-cum. Some sources advise men pass urine before having sex to help flush out any leftover semen, but there is not evidence to support this practice.\nSo can you get pregnant from the pull out method?\nThe Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Health (FSRH) in the UK says data suggests that approximately 4-6% of women in the UK may be using the withdrawal method. Figures from the USA suggest that with perfect use, 4% of women will have an unintended pregnancy at 1 year; with typical use, this increases up to 22%. (1) This means more than 1 in 5 women using the withdrawal method would fall pregnant.\nMost other forms of long-acting contraception have failure rates of less than 1%, and with typical use, the combined and mini pills are around 91% effective (9 in 100 women will get pregnant over 1 year of use).\nAs the FSRH states, if practised correctly withdrawal may work for some couples, particularly as a backup to other methods of contraception.\nUltimately, using the pull-out method is for you to decide, but here are some pros and cons to help you make the decision.\nPros of the pull-out method:\n\nIt’s free\nIt does not contain any hormones. (Some women prefer using contraception that does not contain hormones as they could have a negative impact on their body – of course, some females find that hormonal contraception is actually better for them)\nThe withdrawal method has no side effects\nBy pulling out, other forms of birth control you may be using will be even more effective\n\n\nCons of the pull-out method: \n\nIt does not protect you from STIs (sexually transmitted diseases)\nIt relies on the male being able to accurately identify when to withdraw and acting on this. Many couples plan to pull out, but sometimes can forget in the heat of the moment\nIt’s not as effective as other available methods of contraception\nIt is not recommended by doctors as a method of contraception on its own (ie may be used in addition to another recommended method)\n\n\n\nWhat did The Lowdown reviewers have to say?\n“I have three planned children and have used the pull-out method since the birth of my first child 16 years ago. I get pregnant very easily, with each child of mine being conceived when my partner and I decided we wanted to try. It works well for us. But I do want to say that it’s really up to how good the man is in pulling out and timing. This may not be for everyone because of that.\n“It’s not the best”\n“The withdrawal method is great because it’s skin to skin and no hormones. But there’s always a higher change you might get pregnant with this method of contraception.”\n“Used this method of contraception prior to using the Natural Cycles app to plan a pregnancy. It was highly effective and [a] chosen method of contraception due to worries about side effects of combined pill. Sex drive increased dramatically, and mood became much more stable. Have returned to this method since having first child.”\n“Although it is frowned upon, it allows for an enjoyable experience in and out of the vagina. If you are sensible and your partner knows when he will cum and how to control himself, then it is a feasible method. We don’t use this method all the time though.”\n“I have been with my partner for over eight years… so we use the pull out method and have never had any pregnancy scares. We used to occasionally use condoms in the beginning but we had two instances of the condom breaking so don’t use them anymore.”\nIf you are thinking of using the withdrawal method as a form of contraception, then do talk to your nurse , doctor or sexual health specialist. We advise that before starting, switching or stopping any form of contraception, consider speaking with a healthcare professional. The Lowdown offers chats with a professional through the website.\nSophie is a Cardiff University- trained journalist who is passionate about sharing womens’ contraception stories in the hope that it will connect with others.You can find her on Twitter.\n",

        "Title": "The snip &#8211; a complete guide to getting a vasectomy",
        "Content": "\nWhilst the thought of a vasectomy might make most men wince; this male sterilisation technique is a highly effective and relatively painless way of providing permanent contraception.With very few side-effects and a surgery time that can be as quick as 15 minutes, getting the snip is an excellent long-term solution for couples looking to protect against pregnancy. ✅ If you think you’ll find this blog interesting, make sure to check out our newsletter for more:\n1. How does the snip work?\nA vasectomy is where the tubes (vas deferens) carrying the sperm from the man’s testicles to the penis are blocked or cut, (hence the slang term ‘getting the snip’) and then sealed to ensure that when a man ejaculates the semen has no sperm in it. There are two types of vasectomy procedures, the conventional vasectomy and the no-scalpel vasectomy.\nThe conventional vasectomy\nThe no-scalpel vasectomy\nAs the name suggests, this type of vasectomy doesn’t involve a scalpel. Instead the doctor will make a tiny puncture hole in the skin of your scrotum to be able to reach the tubes. The tubes are then closed in the same way as a conventional vasectomy.  This type of vasectomy is deemed to be less painful, and lead to less surgical complications.\n2. How long is a vasectomy procedure?\nThe vasectomy operation is very quick, and usually only takes around 15-30 minutes to perform.\n3. How do I get the snip?\nA vasectomy is available free of charge on the NHS, but it can involve a fairly long waiting list of several months depending on where you live. Your GP or local contraception clinic can provide more information. For men wishing to have the procedure carried out quickly, there is the option to go private, and price will vary depending on the clinic.\n4. Can you get a vasectomy on the NHS?\nYes, you can get a vasectomy on the NHS. Your GP will be able to refer you for the procedure, but there may be a waiting list of several months.\n5. Does a vasectomy hurt?\nAs the vasectomy is a relatively quick procedure it only requires a local anaesthetic which will numb you from any pain during the procedure. You will likely experience some pain, mild discomfort and swelling after the procedure.\n6. For how long will I be in pain after getting the snip?\nMost men experience pain and swelling and bruising of the scrotum for a couple of days post surgery. It is also common to have blood in your first few ejaculations but this is nothing to worry about. We would recommend organising someone to drive you home from the hospital post surgery to avoid any unnecessary strain or discomfort.  Urinating may feel slightly uncomfortable at the beginning but should ease off fairly quickly.\n7. Will I need to go back in for stitch removal post-surgery?\nStitches are not normally used. You may have some small sutures used to close the skin, but these are normally dissolvable. They may take 2-4 weeks to dissolve.\n8. How will I know if it’s worked?\nAbout twelve weeks after the vasectomy procedure, your doctor will ask you to produce a sample of semen. This will then be tested for sperm. Once it has been confirmed that your sample is sperm free, then the vasectomy is classed as being successful. If the sample isn’t sperm free, the doctor may require you to provide another sample after this. It is very important to keep using alternative forms of contraception until the vasectomy is classed as successful.\n9. How long after a vasectomy am I sterile?\nIt can take several months for semen to be sperm free after a vasectomy. Semen is typically tested by a doctor after three months and twelve ejactulations to check it’s sperm free. Some doctors may wish to test 6-12 weeks again after this to ensure sterility.\n10. How long before I can masturbate or have sex after getting the snip?\nDoctors recommend that you wait up to one week before having sex to allow for any discomfort to have passed. The first few ejaculations may seem uncomfortable at first, but this will soon pass. It’s very important to use alternative birth control when having sex during the first few months because a vasectomy does not work immediately and there would still be a risk of pregnancy.\n11. When can I go back to work?\nUsually you will be able to go back to work 1-2 days after your surgery if your work doesn’t involve heavy lifting or manual labour.\n12. How long after getting the snip can I play sports?\nIt’s important to not play sports for at least a week after a vasectomy, with some sports requiring even longer rest time to ensure proper healing. Light exercise such as walking can be resumed one week after surgery, but contact sports such as rugby or hockey should be kept away from for a month. Your doctor can advise you depending on which sports you play.\n13. Will getting the snip impact my erections?\nOne of the main worries for men after a vasectomy is that they may experience impotence and erectile dysfunction. However it is rare for this to be a side effect of having a vasectomy.\n14. Could being sterile affect me emotionally?\nHaving a vasectomy can be a big decision for many men, and one not to be taken lightly. Some men may find it a relief that they don’t need to worry about contraception any more or the risk of pregnancy. Others may worry that the option for more children has been taken away from them. We recommend speaking to your GP or a health clinician if you have any doubts or concerns about the vasectomy procedure that could affect you long term emotionally.\n15. Is the snip reversible?\nReversing a vasectomy is a more complicated procedure than the original operation and isn’t always guaranteed to work. A vasectomy is therefore considered a permanent form of contraception due to it not always being able to successfully be reversed. Therefore, before going through the process of getting the snip, it’s important to ensure that you are comfortable with the idea of not having more children. A vasectomy reversal is achieved by reconnecting the sperm carrying tubes which were blocked or cut in the original procedure.\nThe success of your vasectomy reversal will often depend on how long ago your procedure was performed.\n\n75% if you have your vasectomy reversed within 3 years\nup to 55% after 3 to 8 years\nbetween 40% and 45% after 9 to 14 years\n30% after 15 to 19 years\nless than 10% after 20 years\n\n16. Can you get a vasectomy reversal on the NHS?\nIt is not usually possible to get a reversal on the NHS. If it is available then be prepared to face a long waiting list. Reversals are available privately, though can cost in the thousands to perform.\n17. At what age can you get a vasectomy? \nLegally speaking, if you are over the age of 18 then you are eligible for the procedure without legal consent.  Doctors tend to advise against having a vasectomy under the age of 30, in case you change your mind in the future or meet a partner who would like to have children.\n18. Can having a vasectomy cause premature ejaculation?\nThere is no known correlation between premature ejaculation and a vasectomy.\n19. Can I get my partner pregnant after a vasectomy?\nAccording to the Family Planning Association, approximately 1 in 2000 male sterilisations fail.\nOnce it has been confirmed post-surgery that your semen is sperm free and the vasectomy was a success, there is almost a zero percent chance of getting your partner pregnant. If you have sex prior to your semen being classed as sperm-free then there is still a risk of pregnancy occurring. Therefore it’s important to use alternative contraception in the three months post-procedure.\n20. Can my partner and I use IVF to have children after my vasectomy?\nYes, IVF is still an option for your partner to get pregnant if you have undergone a vasectomy.  This is a particularly good option for men who have had their vasectomy performed many years ago and their is a lower success rate for a reversal. In this instance doctors would need to extract sperm directly from the testes via a needle inserted into the scrotum.\n21. Can I still get or pass on an STI after having a vasectomy?\nYes, having a vasectomy won’t protect you against getting or passing on a sexually transmitted disease. Semen can still carry a sexually transmitted disease even if it doesn’t carry sperm, so it’s important to keep using condoms if there is a risk of getting or spreading an STI.\n22. What are the side effects of getting a vasectomy? \n\nA collection of blood inside the scrotum (haematoma)\nHard lumps caused by sperm leaking from the tubes\nSurgical site infection\nLong term testicle pain\nThe vas deferens tube reconnect (but this is very rare)\n\n23. What are the pros and cons of a vasectomy?\n\nVasectomies are 99% effective\nVasectomies won’t affect your hormones or sex drive\nThey are a long term solution to contraception\nVasectomies don’t protect against STIs\nThey are complicated to reverse if you change your mind about having children\nThey are not immediately effective, and may take 2-3 months to protect against pregnancy\nYou may experience long term testicle pain in some rare cases\n\n24. Can I have the operation if I’m single?\nYes, you can certainly have the operation if you’re single. Any doctor performing the operation will want to ensure though that you have fully thought about the option of not having children in the future.\n25. How much does it cost to have a vasectomy?\nIf you have your vasectomy procedure on the NHS it will be free. If you perform the procedure privately the cost will vary depending at which clinic it is performed. In the case of going private, contact the clinic for more information. See our related articles, including the future of male contraception here.\n",

        "Title": "So you want to talk about&#8230; the vaginal ring",
        "Content": "\nWhat’s the lowdown?\n\n\n \n\nWhat is a vaginal ring?\nThe vaginal ring is made of a type of soft plastic unable to dissolve in the body. Once placed inside the vagina, it releases a dose of oestrogen and progestogen into the bloodstream in order to prevent pregnancy, similar to the combined pill and contraceptive patch. Around 5cm in diameter, it kind of resembles a glowstick. Obviously, without the glow (although that would be strangely awesome).\nAt the Lowdown, we have come up with an easy guide about different contraceptives to help you to find the most effective option. If we look at 100 sexually active women using the ring for a year, with perfect use less than 1 will get pregnant but if we look at typical use 7 women will get pregnant during that year.\nYou can start using the vaginal ring at any time in your cycle. If you start within the first 5 days of your period starting, you will be protected from pregnancy straight away (if you have a short cycle then speak to your doctor or nurse). Any other time in your cycle and you’ll need to use condoms or other contraception for seven days. \nIt can be left inside vagina for 21 days, after which you remove it and have a 7 day ring-free break, as you may do with the combined pill. It’s very common that during this break you may have a withdrawal bleed. Once your break is over, pop in a new ring for another 21 days. If you’re someone who forgets to take the pill often, then the ring could be a reliable option for you. We have also put together a handy guide about how to use combined contraception continuously and avoid having the 7 day break and associated bleeding.\nWhat’s the difference between the NuvaRing and the SyreniRing?\nThe SyreniRing and NuvaRing are practically identical; they both contain the same types and amounts of oestrogen and progestogen. The key difference between these vaginal rings is that the SyreniRing has a shelf life of two years, and doesn’t need to be refrigerated, which means you can be prescribed up to a year’s supply at once. The NuvaRing however, must be refrigerated before being dispensed, and then used within 4 months. Store your Nuvaring at room temperature, in a safe place away from sunlight.\nHow does the vaginal ring work?\nThe vaginal ring works to prevent pregnancy in three ways:\n\nPrimarily, it changes your body’s hormonal balance to stop ovulation (meaning you don’t produce an egg).\nIt causes the mucus in the neck of the womb (cervix) to thicken and form a mucus plug. This makes it difficult for sperm to get through to the womb (uterus) to fertilise an egg that may have been released.\nIt also makes the lining of the womb thinner, which reduces the chances of a fertilised egg becoming attached to the womb.\n\nWhere can I get a vaginal ring?\nOkay, so you’ve decided you want to try out the vaginal ring. It’s available at some GP practices, young peoples’ services, sexual health and contraception clinics. However it’s always best to check if this is something your local practice can offer ahead of making an appointment, and some clinics will only offer services up to a certain age.\nAt the appointment, your GP or healthcare professional will check your medical history, make sure you’re not pregnant and run blood pressure and weight checks to make sure you’re eligible for the vaginal ring.\nIf you already use the vaginal ring, you can also order the SyreniRing directly from The Lowdown.\nBear in mind that it may not be suitable for you if; you take medicines that could interact with the ring, have had a previous blood clot, high blood pressure, a high BMI, diabetes, or are over 35 and a smoker.\nHow to insert a vaginal ring\nNow, you’ve picked up your first vaginal ring and I bet you’re thinking, “how on earth do I get it in?!” The placement of the vaginal ring is similar to fitting a tampon or menstrual cup. It can be a bit fiddly at first, but once it’s in it should stay in place. \nHere’s how to insert a vaginal ring:\n\nFirst things first, wash your hands. Squeeze the ring between your thumb and gently insert it into your vagina. Push in until it feels comfortable and secure – similar to how a tampon feels – and should be far enough inside that you can’t feel it. According to the NHS, unlike the diaphragm or cap, the ring does not need to cover the entrance to the womb to work.\n\nYou can start using it at any time during your menstrual cycle providing you are not pregnant. If you fit it on the first 5 days of your cycle, you will be protected from pregnancy right away. If you fit it at any other time in your cycle then you will need to use condoms for seven days or avoid having penetrative sex. Them’s the rules.\nHow to remove a vaginal ring\nTo stop using your vaginal ring, simply remove it from your vagina. To remove it, place one finger into the vagina, hook the finger under the ring, and gently pull it out. Put it in the bag provided and throw it in the bin.\nIf the vaginal ring comes out and has been out for less than 48 hours, it can be washed in lukewarm water and reinserted with no additional contraception needed. See the NHS guide about what to do if it has been out for longer than 48 hours.\nPros and cons of the vaginal ring\nAdvantages\n\nThe vaginal ring should not interrupt sex\nIt’s easy to insert and remove – once you get the hang of it\nYou don’t have to think about it everyday\nIt’s still effective if you are sick or have diarrhoea\nIt may help with PMS symptoms\nBleeds can become lighter, more regular and less painful\nIt can have additional health benefits which include reducing the risk of ovarian, endometrial and bowel cancers as with all combined contraceptives\nIt has no long-term effect on your fertility\n\nDisadvantages\n\nIt may accidentally fall out during sex or at other times of the month if not properly inserted\nYou may not feel comfortable inserting or removing it\nFor the first few months, you might have some spotting or bleeding\nIt may cause temporary side effects which can include increased vaginal discharge, headaches, nausea, breast tenderness and mood changes\nSlight increased risk of developing blood clots in your veins and arteries\nIt does not protect you against STIs\nYou need to remember to change it every 21 days, and replace it after your break if you have one\nSome medicines might make it less effective\n\nWho should use the vaginal ring?\n\nThose wanting contraception that doesn’t need to be remembered every day\nIf you want your bleeds to be regular, lighter and less painful\nThose who want a form of contraception that isn’t affected by vomiting or diarrhoea\n\nWho shouldn’t use it?\n\nIf you have had a blood clot in a vein or artery\nIf you have had heart or circulatory problems, including high blood pressure\nIf you are 35 or older and smoke, or have stopped smoking in the past year\nIf you have had breast cancer in the past 5 years\n\n\nWhat does The Lowdown say?\nWhile the vaginal ring is one of the less popular methods of contraception on The Lowdown, we still have a great range of reviews on the vaginal ring. You can also see separate reviews on Syreniring and Nuvaring. Here is what a few of our reviewers have to say:\n“It’s a great contraception and it worked perfectly for the first two years, but I started having a lot of headaches and dark spots on my face after that.”\n“Loss of sex drive was the only side effect I had. But, the NuvaRing affects me much less than any other birth control I have tried.”\n“I absolutely loved the NuvaRing. As a college athlete, I had a busy schedule and my schedule varies a lot day-to-day, so being able to leave the ring in for three weeks at a time without worry was amazing. I didn’t experience any side effects beyond my normal period moodiness and cramps. I was able to leave the ring in during sex without too much interference and didn’t have any issues with discomfort. I developed a blood clot almost five years after being on the ring. It couldn’t be determined whether the clot was related to hormonal birth control or not…”\n“Pros: lighter periods, really regular. Cons: Breast pain, I felt discomfort every time I groped my breasts.”\n“This contraception is the best I have tried. I have been on the pill and patches before trying the ring and I would never go back now. For someone who is quite forgetful this is the best solution, it is as simple as putting in a non-applicator tampon, it stays there for three weeks – your partner will feel it during intercourse but I haven’t had any complaints!”\nOverall, the contraceptive vaginal ring is super simple and easy to use. It’s great for busy lifestyles, but you need to make sure you’re comfortable and confident inserting it yourself.\nNot sure if the vaginal ring is right for you? We’ve got thousands of reviews across all methods available in the UK, plus a handy guide on how to talk to your GP about contraception options. Alternatively, you can book an appointment with our medical team to discuss your options and get a personalised action plan.\n\nSophie is a Cardiff University- trained journalist who is passionate about sharing womens’ contraception stories in the hope that it will connect with others.You can find her on Twitter.",

        "Title": "Mirena coil removal &#8211; how long does it last and what happens next?",
        "Content": "\n✅ If this blog sounds interesting, you can sign up to our newsletter for months more: \nThe Mirena coil is a common method of contraception and is most loved for its effectiveness, convenience, longevity and role in treating heavy periods and other medical conditions. It appears that there’s always a lot of talk about how it goes in, but do we know how it comes out?\nThis post covers everything you need to know about coil removal, from what to expect, to possible side effects and even the ‘Mirena crash’. \nWhen to remove or replace the Mirena or hormonal coil\nThe most common reasons for having your hormonal coil removed or replaced include:\n\nif your coil is due to be replaced (after 8 years for Mirena, Levosert and Benliexa, 5 years for Kyleena and 3 years for Jaydess)\nyou wish to switch to another method of contraception\nyou’re not tolerating the side effects of the coil\nyou’re experiencing pain\nor you wish to become pregnant\n\nFor some women, having the coil removed may be recommended by their doctor. \nWhat to expect when having your coil removed\n\n\nCoil removal is a quick procedure that can happen at any time by a trained doctor or nurse, most commonly in a GP practice or sexual health clinic. \nYou will need to get undressed from the waist down and have a vaginal examination using a speculum, the same examination as when the coil is inserted. (Don’t worry, it’s simpler then having it fitted – read more on coil fittings).\nThe doctor will gently pull on the coil threads that should be easily visible in the vagina at the neck of the womb. The T-shaped coil then folds up and it can be pulled out of the womb. Often, the clinician may ask you to cough as this can help ease the coil out without much of a pull at all.\nSome coil removals can be more difficult, for example, if the threads are not easily visible. In these cases, clinicians have a very handy tool that can retrieve coil threads that have moved up into the cervix, but if this doesn’t work, you may need to be referred for an ultrasound scan or to a gynaecologist or contraception clinic.When the coil is out, it should be checked that it is all in tact, as very rarely a part of the coil may break off during removal, possibly when the cervical opening is very tight. If this happens, clinicians will arrange a scan and further removal.\nIf you don’t want to get pregnant, you’ll need to make sure you don’t have sex or will need to use condoms for seven days before you have the Mirena coil removed. This is advised even if you are having the coil replaced in case there is a problem with fitting a new coil. If you wish to switch to another method your healthcare professional may advise you to start this before you have your coil removed.\nMirena coil removal side effects\nAfter your Mirena coil removal, you may expect to experience mild pain, cramps or bleeding which should resolve within a few days. Some women also report feeling tired or having headaches although it’s uncertain whether these side effects are due to Mirena removal. \nIf any symptoms persist or you feel unwell please consult your GP or sexual health clinic. \nDepending on your reason for having the Mirena coil removed – and whether you switch to another contraceptive method – you may experience symptoms associated with a return of your normal menstrual cycle. This could include symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), or other underlying conditions previously treated by the action of the Mirena coil.\nIt is possible this may explain many of the varied symptoms some women report after Mirena coil removal. If you are concerned about the symptoms you are experiencing, or are worried about your health, please speak to your GP.\nCheck out our Mirena coil reviews to read about women’s experiences of having the Mirena coil removed. \nIs your Mirena coil running out?\nTo understand this commonly asked question, first we need to understand how the Mirena coil works…\nAfter it is inserted, the Mirena coil releases a hormone called levonorgestrel, much like progesterone which is normally produced by the female body. This works to prevent pregnancy by thinning the lining of your womb so it’s less likely to accept a fertilised egg (which often makes your periods lighter and sometimes disappear!).\nIt also thickens the mucus in your cervix. This makes it difficult for sperm to move through it and reach an egg. In some people, it stops the ovaries from releasing an egg (ovulation), but most women continue to ovulate.\nSo how long does the Mirena coil last?\nThe Mirena coil is able to be used for contraception for 8 years, however we know women often worry their Mirena coil may stop working before then or that its effects may be wearing off. According to the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Health (FSRH) in the UK, the Mirena coil releases approximately 20μg of levonorgestrel a day, reducing to below 9μg per day after 6-8 years. This is still an effective amount of progestogen for contraception, but may also explain why some users start to develop different side effects throughout their time using the coil.If your coil removal is overdue, you should consider additional contraceptive precautions (e.g. condoms or the progestogen-only pill which can be bought online) until the coil can be replaced.If you are over 45 years old at the time you have your Mirena coil fitted then you can rely on it for contraception, without getting it replaced, until you are 55 years old. However, if you are using your Mirena coil as part of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to manage menopausal symptoms, then this must be changed after 5 years (read more in our guide to Mirena and the menopause).If you’re not sure when to get your Mirena replaced or would like to find out more about getting it removed, speak to one of our friendly female doctors for expert advice on all things contraception.\nWhat about if my Mirena coil has moved out of place?\nSome studies have shown that the coil may not be not as effective if it has moved 2cm or more away from the top of the uterus. You can check its position by following our how-to guide to checking coil threads.Signs that your Mirena coil may have moved or come out include:\n\nYou can’t feel your coil strings\nThe strings feel much longer or shorter than usual\nYou can feel the plastic part of the coil\nYour partner can feel your coil during sex\nYou have pain in your pelvic area or lower tummy\nYour bleeding pattern has suddenly changed e.g. you previously had no periods now you are bleeding\nYour vaginal discharge has changed in smell or colour – this could be a sign of infection so visit your GP quickly\n\nIf you can’t feel your coil strings, or have any of the above symptoms, speak to your GP or go to your local sexual health clinic for an examination.\n‘Mirena crash’\nWhat is the ‘Mirena crash’?The ‘Mirena crash’ refers to symptoms some women have reported experiencing after having their Mirena coil removed. These include many varied symptoms including:\n\nmood changes\nfatigue\nreduced libido\nheadaches\ntender breasts\n\nFor some women, Mirena crash symptoms appear recurrently before each period, lasting for months. Some other women report symptoms ongoing for extended periods of time. There is no definition of this in medical literature and there is no scientific evidence for or research into this. If you are experiencing sore boobs, starflower oil is a little-known life saver when it comes to easing inflammation. Purchase from Amazon here (affiliate link!)\nWhen will your periods and fertility return after the Mirena?\nOne of the great benefits of the Mirena coil/IUS is that it thins the lining of your womb which makes periods lighter or disappear completely (good times for those with heavy periods). After removal, it can take time for this lining to build back up again.Our reviews show that after Mirena coil removal, the majority of women find their usual menstrual cycle returns within a few months (around 1 in 3 of our reviewers have their first period within a month!) If your periods do not return after 6 months of removal then we recommend seeking medical advice to investigate for an underlying cause, NOT due to having had the Mirena.\nHad your Mirena removed and still no period?\nAn important thing to remember is that you can get pregnant without having a period as the ovaries can still release an egg. A review of return to fertility after different contraception showed that the 1-year pregnancy rates for women were the same whether they had stopped using coils, implants and pills as well as barrier methods like condoms.The review also found that the pregnancy rates 1 year after IUS removal (including the Mirena) were between 79-96%, which is similar to that of stopping using condoms.

        "Title": "Everything you need to know &#8211; Progestogen-only pill (POP)",
        "Content": "\nHow effective is the progestogen-only pill?\nThe progestogen-only pill, better known as the progesterone only pill, mini pill or POP, is a form of contraceptive pill which contains synthetic progestogen, similar to progesterone naturally produced by the female body. It is often used by women who are unable to use combined contraception which contains oestrogen, such as if you are breastfeeding or have a history of migraines.\nDesigned to be taken at the same time every day, the mini pill is one of the more popular contraceptives with common brands including Lovima, Cerelle, Cerazette, Norgeston and Noriday.The progestogen-only pill is 99% effective if taken as directed at the same time each day. But, if this mini pill is taken in a ‘typical’ way, i.e not strictly at the same time each day, its effectiveness drops to 92-93%.\nHow does the progestogen-only pill work?\nIt prevents pregnancy by making the fluid in your cervix thicker (which makes it more difficult for sperm to enter the womb) and preventing the lining of your womb thickening enough for a fertilised egg to implant into it. The progestogen-only pills with desogestrel or drospirenone in them (so all of them except Micronor, Noriday and Norgeston) can also stop ovulation.\nHow do I get started on the progestogen-only pill?\nIf you get your pill via an NHS prescription through your GP, nurse or sexual health clinic, your doctor or nurse may check your medical history, any medicines you take and make sure that you’re not pregnant. You can also buy the progestogen-only pill through pharmacies – The Lowdown has its very own ordering service! Our pharmacists will check your medical history through our short online questionnaire.\nThere are two established types of progestogen-only pill:\n\nThree hour traditional progestogen-only pills (Norgeston, Noriday, Micronor) must be taken within three hours of the same time every day\nTwelve hour desogestrel progestogen-only pills (Cerazette, Lovima, Cerelle, Nacrez, Zelleta, Aizea, Desomono and Desorex) which must be taken within twelve hours of the same time every day\n\nDoesn’t interrupt sex\nCan use it when breastfeeding\nCan use at any age – even if you are over 50 or are over 35 and smoke (reasons you can’t taken oestrogen containing contraceptives)\nIt’s useful if you can’t take the hormone oestrogen, which is in the combined pill, contraceptive patch and vaginal ring\nIt can stop your periods or make them lighter, less frequent and less painful\nIt may help with the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome\n\nCons of the progestogen only pill\n\nVomiting and diarrhea will impact on how the pill is absorbed into your body. If you’re sick within 3 to 4 hours of taking the desogestrel or drospirenone POP (or 2 hours of taking the traditional POPs) you’ll need to take another pill straight away and the next pill at the usual time. \n\nWill the progestogen-only/mini pill affect my periods?\nThe progestogen-only pill can affect your periods. They may become lighter, less frequent or stop altogether, which may be beneficial. They may also become irregular or prolonged or you may experience spotting between periods.\nWho should use it?\n\ncan remember to take a pill regularly\ncan’t or don’t want to take oestrogen containing contraceptives\n\nWho shouldn’t use it?\n\nthink they might be pregnant\ndon’t want their periods to change\ntake other medicines that may affect the pill\nhave unexplained bleeding in between periods and sex\nhave had heart disease or a stroke, liver disease or breast cancer\n\nWhat if I miss taking a pill?\nMissing or forgetting to take a pill has happened to the best of us. Check out our missed pill calculator which will help you with what to do, depending on how many you’ve missed and where you are in your pill packet. We’ll update this with the drospirenone pill rules when this becomes available in the UK! If you have any doubt, then make sure you use alternative contraception such as a condom or don’t have sex until you’re protected and speak to your pharmacist.\nWhere can you get the progestogen-only pill?\nIn the UK, you should be able to get a free NHS prescription for the progestogen-only pill in most contraception clinics, sexual health clinics, GPs surgeries, and some young people’s services.The progestogen-only pills Lovima and Hana are available over the counter from the pharmacy (ie without a prescription). You can buy most brands of the progestogen-only pill through us at The Lowdown!\n",

        "Title": "Intrauterine device (IUD) &#8211; everything you need to know",
        "Content": "\n✔️If you think this blog sound informative, make sure to check out our newsletter for more:\nWhat is the IUD?\nThe intrauterine device (IUD), also known as the copper coil is a small T-shaped plastic and copper device that’s placed into your womb (uterus). Most copper coils are made of a T-shaped frame of polyethylene (plastic) and barium sulphate with copper wire wound around the vertical arm. It is a non-hormonal form of contraception. Getting pregnant with the copper IUD is unlikely as it is 99% effective.You can look through the contraception reviews at The Lowdown to see how people like you experienced having the IUD, or you can leave your own to guide others.\nHow does the IUD work? \nIt releases copper into your womb which prevents pregnancy by affecting sperm motility, preventing egg fertilisation and possibly preventing implantation. It can protect from pregnancy for 5 or 10 years, depending on the brand, which takes away the stress of having to keep track of what pills you’ve taken or what injections you’ve had.\nHow do I get started? \nTo get a coil fitted you will need to go to a GP surgery or sexual health clinic where certain staff are trained to fit them. You can contact your GP and ask if they fit coils, or search for clinics that fit coils here. Your doctor or nurse will do some tests to make sure that you can have the coil – like making sure that you’re not pregnant and checking for infections or STIs.\nThe coil can be fitted in the first five days or your menstrual cycle (day 1 is the first day of your period), or at any time during your cycle as long as you’re not pregnant or at risk of pregnancy from unprotected sex. Because of the way the copper coil works it can also be used as emergency contraception so this may be an option if you’ve had unprotected sex.It may also be easier to fit the coil at the start of your menstrual cycle during your period (although you may prefer to get it fitted when you’re not on your period).\nYour doctor or nurse will use a speculum (like when you have a smear test) to open up your vagina and then insert the coil through the cervix into the womb. This can be uncomfortable. There is an option to have a local anaesthetic to help with the pain and you may be advised to take painkillers, so make sure to discuss this with your doctor or nurse before the procedure.\nOnce the IUD has been fitted, it is effective straight away. You will be taught how to check the coil is in place by feeling for the threads. GP practices and sexual health clinics may offer you an appointment after 3 to 6 weeks to examine you to check the coil and make sure everything is ticking along smoothly. Be sure to alert your GP if you have any problems after this initial check, or if you want to have the IUD removed.\nThere is a small risk of an infection following IUD insertion which if left untreated may lead to a pelvic infection. You may have an infection if you:\n\nHave pain in your lower abdomen\nHave a high temperature\nHave an odour or increased unusual discharge\n \n\nSide effects of the copper IUD are that it can make your periods heavier, longer and more painful in the first 3-6 months after it is fitted and you may also get spotting or bleeding in-between periods. 61% of Lowdown users claimed it made their periods heavier. Treatment for heavy periods is available from your GP and can include non-hormonal medications such as tranexamic acid or mefenamic acid.  Some people claim the copper coil causes weight gain, but there is no evidence to support this and 76% of our users state that their weight had not changed.\nHow to tell if your IUD is still in place \nThe IUD has 2 thin threads which hang down slightly from your womb which you should be able to feel at the top of your vagina. Whoever fits your IUD will teach you how to feel for these threads. It’s recommended to check that the IUD is in place a few times in the first month, then at least after each period.\nIt’s unlikely that your IUD will come out, but it can happen in around 1 in 20 cases, and usually these happen within the first 3 months. If you are unable to feel the threads or think it may have moved, you may not be protected from pregnancy. If this happens use additional contraception, e.g. condoms, until your IUD has been checked by your doctor or nurse. Your partner should not be able to feel your IUD during sex but if they think they can you may want to see your GP or nurse for a check-up. Sometimes the threads can be trimmed and this may be more comfortable.\nWhat about the IUD removal? \nYour coil can be removed at any time by a trained doctor or nurse. It’s simpler than having it fitted – they will gently pull on the threads and the T shape folds up and it can be pulled out of the womb.\nIf you’re not having another coil put in and don’t want to get pregnant, you’ll need to make sure you don’t have sex seven days before you have it removed, or use condoms or another method.\nCheck out our survey results to see how long it took most women’s cycles to return to their definition of ‘normal’ and read up about other after-effects they’ve experienced.\nIUD vs IUS \nThe IUD (copper coil) and the IUS (hormonal coil) are very similar, however the one significant difference being HOW they prevent pregnancy. The IUD works by realising copper into the body to prevent pregnancy, whereas the IUS releases a hormone called progestogen into the body. The IUD may be favoured by women who want to avoid hormonal contraception. You can use our contraception comparison to further inform yourself.\nPros of the IUD \n\nProtects from pregnancy for 5 or 10 years\nOnce fitted, it is effective straight away\nMost women are able to use it\nThere are no hormonal side effects\nIt does not interrupt sex\nSafe to use whilst breast feeding\nNot affected by other medicines\n\nCons of the IUD\n\nSmall risk of infection after it’s been fitted. This may occur when harmless bacteria normally found in vagina are pushed inside the womb. Contact your doctor if you are worried you have an infection or experience unusual discharge, abdominal pain, or you develop a high temperature or chills\nAround 1 in 20 coils can fall out or be pushed out by the womb; this is most common in the first 3 months after getting it fitted, or during a period. If this happens, you are not protected from pregnancy and will need to use another form of contraception\nIf the coil doesn’t work and you get pregnant (which is very unlikely as the coil is more than 99% effective), there’s also a small increased risk of ectopic pregnancy – when the fertilised egg implants outside the womb, normally in the fallopian tubes. However, the overall risk of ectopic pregnancy is less in women using a coil than in women using no contraception at all.\nVery occasionally the threads get lost. This happens to about 1 in 100 women, and is more commonly caused by the threads being pulled up inside into the cervix. They may notice this when you go to have the coil removed, and sometimes the threads can reappear naturally. \nEven more occasionally (1 in 1000 chance) the coil may damage the wall of the womb. This is called ‘perforation’ and if this happens you won’t be protected against pregnancy and occasionally the coil will need to be removed by surgery.\n\nWho should use the IUD?\n\nwant a contraception that is long lasting\nwant a non-hormonal form of contraception\nare breast feeding or taking medicines that may affects some forms of hormonal contraception\n\n\nthink they might be pregnant\nhave an untreated STI or pelvic infection\nhave anatomical problems with their womb or cervix\nhave unexplained bleeding between periods or after sex\nhave a condition called Wilson’s disease which causes higher levels of copper in the blood stream\n\nWhere can I get the IUD?\nIn the UK, you are able to get the IUD for free, even if you’re under 16. You can get it from most contraception clinics, some GPs surgeries and some young people’s services.\n",

        "Content": "\nIt’s fair to say that most women own some form of pleasure device and many are open about talking to their friends about it. However, for men, owning a sex toy might seem more taboo, more commonly taboo with heterosexual men we might add.\nHowever, humans are creative ones and so, since pretty much the dawn of time, we have been finding interesting ways to have that ever-important ‘me time’ (anyone remember that humiliating American Pie apple pie scene) and this includes men.  Humans have been crafting pleasure toys from whatever they could get their hands on. So, how did men get some?\nA brief history of male sex toys\nWhen Burmese Balls or Chinese Ben Wa Balls (small metal balls used to strengthen the pelvic floor) were created, men would insert them into their penis to increase pleasure.\nAccording to askmen, in Ancient Greece, stale bread would not only be used as a side to a feta salad, but it would double up as a trusty dildo. Flavour it with some olive oil for lube and you’ve got yourself dinner finished off with a treat. Bread dildos were used by women and men, plus they were biodegradable – how woke of them!\nSome 2,000 years ago, a jade and bronze butt plug was discovered in the tomb of a king near modern-day Shanghai. According to researchers, Chinese aristocrats enjoyed using these and bronze strap-ons. However, some people believe butt plugs were used to close orifices of the dead, so it isn’t certain if they were used for sexual pleasure.\nThen, soon into the 17th century, seamen began experimenting with sex dolls or what they called dames de voyage. They would often fashion cloth into dolls to be used while they were at sea.\nFast-forward to the 20th century and sex dolls were being mass-produced and used by many. Rumour has it that Hitler even charged one of his SS commanders to design sex dolls for German soldiers during World War Two, to prevent them from getting it on with the enemy.\nIn the USA, sex dolls weren’t advertised in porn magazines until roughly 1968, when it became legal to sell sexual devices through the mail. While men have been seeking pleasure in creative ways for years, they have had seemingly less purchasable options compared to women, up until recently (bar the artificial vagina).\nOkay so now we’ve established the history, how can men get their stimulation? Men do have a variety of options which include; the artificial vagina, the fleshlight (similar to the artificial vagina but can be shaped into a vulva, anus or mouth orifice), or a prostate massage which centres around stimulation close to the bum (can be stimulated with a finger or a device).\nThat’s all well and good I hear you cry, but where do we go from here? Fear not, you will be answered. Read on to find out more about the best sex toys for men.\n\nThe best male sex toys\nMangasm Lifetime Silicone Stroker\nA version of the fleshlight, GQ says that this toy feels like the inside of a vagina more than any other masturbation sleeve on the market. The designers used a 3D scan from the winner of the world’s most beautiful vagina contest (yep, it’s actually a thing).\nLovehoney O Force Hands-free Masturbator\n“Give your wrist a break” Men’s Health says with this powerful hands-free device. Formed of a shallow canal, it stimulates the penis with your pick of five high-voltage settings. Use it in the shower or the bath too as this baby is waterproof.\n\nSource: LoveHoney\nClandestine Mimic Black OS\nThis mini spaceship can be utilised anywhere. The ergonomic shape is designed to fit perfectly in any hand and where you place it is your choice!\nTenga Egg\nProbably one of the more affordable ones if you’re on our kind of budget but Men’s Health says this one isn’t going to rock your socks off. To make matters worse, this little guy can only be used once so those trying to stay green while they masturbate should probably stay away. GQ also voices a  pretty similar opinion but adds that it’s pretty useful for switching things up when your usual way becomes tiring.\n\n\nSource: Tenga\nWe-Vibe Vector\nThis is a prostate stimulator on steroids, says Men’s Health. Functioning with dual motors that buzz both the prostate part and the perineum part. If you’re in a long-distance relationship, this pleasure product comes with an app that can be controlled from anywhere in the world.\nFun Factory Duke Rechargeable Vibrating Prostate Massager\nAccording to GQ this isn’t a massager for beginners. It has three separate components that stimulate various highly-sensitive erogenous zones. The first part can extend deep into the prostate while the second nuzzles against it.\nThere are many more adult sex toys out there that men can use for their pleasure. Of course, The Lowdown team would love to hear your reviews of male sex toys. Have you tried them out? Perhaps alone or with a partner?

        "Title": "My contraceptive journey: Anything but the pull out",
        "Content": "\nDeciding whether to go onto contraception as a teen can be a difficult decision, especially if the information out there isn’t helpful. Usually, the pill is every female’s first option. Here, Nicola Godsell tells The Lowdown about her contraceptive journey.\nNavigating the world of sex as a teenager is fun and exciting, but not without risk. Luckily there is a huge range of contraceptives available, with 86% of teenage girls having sex now using contraception. We are heading in the right direction (but we are not there yet)!\nOral contraceptives and the male condom seem to be the most popular methods of contraception, but I found there was little information out there about other methods, especially as a teen. I went with the crowd and got the pill when I was 17 and had a pretty rocky time as a result. \nNo pull out method please\nAs a teen, helping my friends through numerous pregnancy scares made me think smart. Hannah had found herself a boyfriend and as someone new to the world of sex I loved hearing the nitty-gritty about what they got up to, learning the ins and outs of everything (pardon the pun). But there was one thing I did not want to hear, “My period is late again”. There were so many times I just wanted to shake her and say “Pulling out is not proper contraception”.\nAround 2 out of 10 people who use the withdrawal method get pregnant each year – that is pretty risky in my eyes. I was fed up having to support her through panic of yet another pregnancy scare and was scared shitless that that would ever happen to me.\nNo one really spoke about contraceptive options for women apart from the pill, so that’s what I went for. After a quick trip to the doctor I got the combined pill (Rigevidon) and was proud to tell my friends that I was being responsible. It’s 99% effective, right? It would be stupid not to. AND it meant no longer relying on guys to act smart, which clearly my friend Hannah hadn’t realised.\nAt first, I was thanking the gods that my periods were lighter, shorter, and more regulated. No more cramps and no more surprises. What’s not to like? I was happy for a while, plus the pill had cleared up my spots and made me loose a little weight, but after a few months I started going crazy. My emotions were all over the shop, one minute I’d be perfectly happy and the next I’d be breaking down in tears and in a state of melancholy. I was never a huge crier, so I just thought that my new relationship was to blame.\nAfter a few more months the crying went away, but the low mood stayed. After my relationship went tits up, I considered going off the pill. But at the time I didn’t think the trigger for my low mood could be down to this little pill. Female contraception is romanticized as life-changing, empowering and purely positive, yet most people seem oblivious to the side-effects. Side-effects that can last, even after you stop taking your contraception.\nDid it cause my depression?\nAfter about a year of feeling low and a thorough google search, I stopped taking the pill. I knew my own body and I knew the pill was doing me no favours. So I chucked the last packet away, feeling positive about the end of this mess. Stopping the pill gave me worse cramps than before and longer periods, but I didn’t care. For me, the negative impact on my mood far outweighed the worry of getting pregnant. The pill had changed who I was.\nDepression has followed me since and I understand it is not entirely down to the pill. But for me, one uniformed choice I made when I was a teen has triggered something that has stuck with me. I wouldn’t wish this experience even on my arch-nemesis. Starting contraception should have more guidance, especially for girls at a time where their hormones aren’t balanced.\nBy no means is my story the same for everyone, around half of my friends at the time were using the pill and most were happy with its magical powers to stop accidental pregnancies. The pill can be used for other things too, I had two friends got the pill to fix acne and hormonal imbalances.\nIt lights a little fire in me when I’m reminded of the lack of information out there for young girls about different contraceptive options and how women have to deal with side-effects when men can walk scot free.\nSince then, I have been much more thorough with my research about the effects of various contraceptives on mood. Being informed is the single best thing a person with periods can do to find the contraceptive that works for them. \nThis blog is a part of The Lowdown’s My Contraceptive Journey series.

        "Content": "\nDespite being sure that the injection was the right method of birth control for her, the nurse at Lili’s GP practice was adamant she try other brands of contraceptive pills first. Here, Lili Bunten tells The Lowdown her story.\nThe injection, please?\n“Are you sure you don’t want to try the pill again?”, I was asked as I sat in the sexual health nurse’s office, asking for the Depo Provera injection for the third time.\nRewind five years to 15-year old me, sat in a different nurse’s office being prescribed the combined pill for the first time. I originally went on Rigevidon to try to regulate my highly irregular periods which, of course, decided to show their face at the most inconvenient of times. It felt like the best thing to go on at the time as I would be taking a pill with a week’s break each month. At first, I thought the pill was great, it was doing its job regulating my periods and I hadn’t encountered any unwanted effects so far.\nOh, how wrong was I. What followed was the eruption of acne and intense mood swings which started only two months into starting it. Of course, myself and everyone around me put it down to purely being a ‘moody teenager’ who was going through puberty. I continued taking the pill (in blissful ignorance to the effect it was having on my body) for around three years, trying different brands along the way. This was in the hope that I would just grow out of the effects stereotypically associated with being a teen. But that never happened.\n\n“I put it down to being a moody teenager”\n\nHowever, as much as I would love to sit here and say I had some great bodily epiphany by realising the pill was the cause of my poor skin and even poorer temperament, this was not the case. Realistically, I wasn’t consistent in taking the pill each day or at the right time and decided I needed a break from the daily forgetting and stressing. Not taking the pills probably exacerbated the negative effects, but hey, nobody’s perfect!\nNo pill, no problem\nDuring the next few months on no contraception, I realised just how much of an impact the pill had on me and my body. My skin started to clear up, I was experiencing far fewer mood swings and I was feeling much happier in general. “This is great”, I thought, “I’m going to stick hormone-free forever!” But then life came along.\nAge 20, I met my boyfriend and it just made sense to go back onto contraception. We used condoms for the first two months but I wanted to go onto something more long-term. My friend who also had similar problems like me on the combined pill recommended the Depo Provera injection. She said her periods stopped completely and she didn’t have any side effects compared to when she was on the pill. After some googling of my own, I decided it was perfect for me (mainly because it lasted three months but the no periods appealed to me too).Side note: I absolutely don’t think getting into a relationship requires a woman to go on contraception, but for us, it worked (condoms aren’t cheap – especially for students!).\n\n“The nurse was adamant I try more contraceptive pill first”\n\nSo, here I now am sat in the sexual health nurse’s office at my GP’s practice, insisting I go on the Depo Provera injection. For some reason, the nurse was adamant I try more contraceptive pills which I politely declined after explaining my past experience. She informed me my mood swings would be much worse on the injection and also suggested fitting a coil instead. I explained I wasn’t comfortable with having something physical in my uterus (but a cocktail of hormones being pumped into my body was completely fine; weird thought process, I know). I felt frustrated as I felt like she wasn’t listening to me at all. I think sometimes, medical professionals don’t take side effects as seriously and in general, have a more relaxed attitude towards prescribing contraception. Finally, she agreed to give me the injection; luckily for her, they were out of stock.\nSo I had to take a trip to my local sexual health clinic instead, who I must add were amazing. She, along with other nurses I have seen in clinics seem like they really listen and are more open to a discussion than when I’ve visited my GP. They also are very non-judgmental as all they see in clinics are people talking about sexual health so maybe they’re just more comfortable about talking about it.\nNo regrets\nFast forward a year on and I couldn’t be happier with the injection. I haven’t had any negative side effects and my periods have completely stopped! Plus, I only have to remember to get it done every three months. I do understand the main concern for taking the injection is thinning of the bones; so I was planning to take an ‘injection-holiday’ soon. Funnily enough, I didn’t have to worry about this as coronavirus and lockdown have provided me with this earlier than planned as I haven’t had another injection since my last one ran out in May.\nI am planning on going back on it though as my skin has become quite bad, mainly on either side of my neck which, according to Google, is due to hormones. I don’t think I’d consider any other method; I don’t like the idea of an object/thing inside me such as the coil or the implant and the injection has worked so well for me. I think the only other one I’d be open to is the patch.\nSo, all in all, the pill wasn’t for me, but the injection definitely is. My main take-home message is: you know what’s right for your body! If a contraceptive hasn’t worked for you, don’t let anyone try to tell you otherwise or invalidate your experiences. Plus, it’s good to take a break when possible, especially if you’ve been on it for a long period of time. Doing this really helped me to understand my body better and how contraception changed me.\nThis blog is a part of The Lowdown’s My Contraceptive Journey series.

        "Content": "\n✔️If you think this blog sound informative, make sure to check out our newsletter for more:\n\nThe contraceptive patch is a method that doesn’t sit high on the popularity scale and because of this, it can cause a lot of confusion. It’s regularly mistaken for a nicotine patch, a plaster, even a bit of plastic that’s accidentally attached itself to someone.\nThis underrated method is actually a strong competitor in the world of contraceptives and here’s why…\nWhat is the contraceptive patch?\nThe patch is a thin, beige plaster that contains the same hormones as the combined contraceptive pill –  oestrogen and progestogen. The patch is changed weekly which may mean that you are less likely to forget to take it, as can happen with daily contraceptive pills.\nHow effective is the contraceptive patch?\nWhen we look at how effective a contraceptive method is we look at typical and perfect use. At the Lowdown, we have come up with an easy guide about different contraceptives to help you to find the most effective option.  If we look at 100 sexually active women using the patch for a year, with perfect use less than 1 will get pregnant, but if we look at typical use then 7 women will get pregnant during that year.\nThe patch may be less effective for people who weigh more than 90kg. This does not mean you cannot use it, but extra precautions such as condoms are recommended.\nHow do I start using the patch?\nYou can start using the patch at any time in your cycle. If you stick it on within the first 5 days of your period starting, you will be protected from pregnancy straight away (if you have a short cycle then speak to your doctor or nurse). Any other time in your cycle and you’ll need to use condoms or other contraception for seven days. Speak to a health professional for advice if you are switching from another hormonal method of contraception. \nYou can start to use the patch 21 days after you give birth if you’re not breastfeeding and have no other risk factors. If you are breastfeeding, you can use the patch after your baby is 6 weeks old.\nA new patch is applied once a week, every week, for three weeks (21 days). You then stop using the patch for seven days (a patch-free week). During this week you get a period-like withdrawal bleed. After seven patch-free days, you apply a new patch on the eighth day. It’s really important that you don’t have more than seven days without the patch – you should do this even if you’re still bleeding.\n\nCan I use the patch without breaks?\nAs with the combined contraceptive pill, you can use the patch continuously or back-to-back. Our continuous pill taking guide explains how to reduce the number of breaks or withdrawal bleeds, which can help if you have problem periods or just want to avoid a bleed.\nWhere do I put the contraceptive patch?\nTo apply, stick the first patch in the packet onto your skin – you can stick it on most areas as long as the skin is dry, clean and not very hairy. Don’t stick it on your breasts; sore, irritated skin; or areas that it’s likely to rub against your clothes. People tend to stick it on their bum, upper arms or lower back.\nWhat do I do if the contraceptive patch falls off?\nThe contraceptive patch is very sticky and it should stay on during a bath, shower or swimming but some people report having issues with them sticking.\nHowever, if the patch does fall off, the next steps will be dependent on how long it’s been off for and how many days the patch was on before it came off.\nIf it’s been off for less than 48 hours:\n\nStick it back on as soon as possible if it still has its stick\nIf it’s not sticky, put a new patch on (do not try to hold the old patch in place with a plaster or bandage)\nContinue to use your patch as normal and change your patch on your normal change day\nYou’re protected against pregnancy and won’t need additional contraception if it was on correctly for 7 days before it came off\nBut if the patch fell off after using it for 6 days or less, use additional contraception, such as condoms, for 7 days.\n\nIf it’s been off for 48 hours or more, or you’re not sure how long:\n\nApply a new patch as soon as possible and start a new patch cycle (this will now be day one of your new cycle)\nUse additional contraception for 7 days\n\nAsk your healthcare professional (for example your GP, nurse, pharmacist or sexual health clinical) for advice if you’ve had unprotected sex in the previous few days as you may need emergency contraception.\n\nWhat are the benefits of using the contraceptive patch?\n\nEasy to use and doesn’t interrupt sex\nDoesn’t need to be taken every day\nCan make periods regular, lighter and less painful\nIt can help with premenstrual symptoms\nIt may improve acne and help with symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome\n\nWhat are the risks of using the contraceptive patch?\nOne rare but serious risk of any combined contraceptive method is blood clots, this includes deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. The risk of blood clots is highest when you first start a combined contraceptive, mainly as it might highlight an underlying blood clotting problem that you may have or be due to hormonal change to proteins in your blood. It is also important that if you have a long period of immobility such as a long-haul flight, you are aware of the increased risk of blood clots.\nWhile the risk is very low, look out for the symptoms of a blood clot. These include stabbing pains or swelling in one leg, pain on breathing or coughing, coughing up blood, sudden breathlessness or chest pain.\nThe combined patch may also increase your blood pressure so you will need to have this checked before you are prescribed the pill and normally once a year whilst using it. Use of combined hormonal contraception is also associated with small increased risks of breast cancer and cervical cancer which reduce with time after stopping. \nFor more information about the range of contraception available, have a browse of our contraception pages.\nWhat are the side effects when using the contraceptive patch?\nAs with all contraceptive methods, people may experience a range of different side effects or none at all. \nThe below side effects are some of the most frequently reported from users of the contraceptive patch;\n\nTender breasts \nVaginal discharge\nPeriod like cramping \nEnlarged breasts \nNausea or vomiting \nVaginal dryness\n\nTake a look at our contraceptive patch side effects to see what users said about changes to their mood, bleeding, sex drive, and weight. You can also check out our reviews page for stories about how other users got on with the patch.\nWho shouldn’t use the contraceptive patch?\nAs with all combined contraceptive, there are some people who should avoid this method which includes;\n\nRaised BMI above 35\nPrevious blood clots or strong family history of blood clots\nMigraines with aura\nHigh blood pressure\nSmoking history and over age 35\n\nHow do I get the contraceptive patch?\nYou can get the patch free of charge from your GP or sexual health clinics. You can also purchase it via The Lowdown website. \nThe main contraceptive patch we have on offer is the Evra patch. Read Evra reviews, side effects and more.\nDoes the patch come in different colours?\nThe patch is a pale beige colour and unfortunately does not come in different skin tones. The team at the Lowdown find this unacceptable and are keen to challenge the brand to be more diverse and inclusive of different skin colours.

        "Content": "\nDisclaimer: This blog has not been medically reviewed. The views expressed here are those of the writer and do not necessarily reflect those of The Lowdown or our medical team. For information about your contraception or the different methods available please check out our contraception pages.\nFor many young contraception users, it is normal to trial and test contraceptive pills to find one that works for them. Reasons tend to be for mood management, lighter periods or birth control, and the side effects can be mild. However, for Tesh Reyes, it took three pills, three scans and five years for doctors to find the right pill and the route cause of her stomach pain.\nHere, she tells The Lowdown about her contraceptive journey.\nPain pain go away\nAt 19 years old, Tesh describes struggling with really bad period pain and stomach cramps. After visiting her GP and having her first ultrasound, which she describes as being pretty overwhelming for a teenager, the doctor diagnosed her with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS); a common condition that affects how a female’s ovaries work.\nThe pain, Tesh describes, was that it felt like your uterus was constantly going to fall out. “Period poo was a big part of my symptoms and even urinating was painful but not in a UTI kind of way,” she says. While she wasn’t much of a going out person, at the time, Tesh worked in a kitchen as a line cook and standing for that long was really difficult. “It’s like your ovaries are being squeezed.”\nTo help with her PCOS, the doctor prescribed her the pill Diane35. She says to her surprise, it worked really well in easing the pain, plus it cleared up her skin. However, she did gain a lot of weight but it wasn’t anything compared to the discomfort she was suffering before.\nAfter a while and despite Diane35 helping with her pain, Tesh wanted to try different pills in the hope that her symptoms would subside even more. Eventually, it also started to stop working for her and so moving to different pills felt like the right option. “According to my scans, Diane did not do a significant change in my PCOS but it regulated my periods. It made my skin less oily and gave me bigger boobs (no complaints there).”\nTesh says she received mixed reactions from doctors when asking to change pills. “Some doctors were helpful and some just made me cry.” Because Diane35 made her gain weight, one doctor insisted that losing weight would help with her PCOS which really upset her. “She kept repeating and repeating that I should lose weight. It made my teary-eyed because it’s like she insisted there was no other way.” Tesh says she felt like her only option was either lose weight or stay on Diane35 and neither were ideal at the time.\n\nAllergic reaction\nThe second pill Tesh tried was Althea. Unfortunately, Tesh found herself having an extreme allergic reaction to this pill which led her to suffer from urticaria. “I had to go to a dermatologist to get that sorted out. It was challenging because I needed the pill but it gave me negative reactions.”\nShe says, before the urticaria, Althea was not the best but it did the job. “It really cleared my skin and I was on it for three months before the urticaria started,”, so it was frustrating she had to come off it. The new condition was so bad that it kept her up at night, she kept scratching and scratching and eventually left dark marks over her skin.\nAfter suddenly coming of Althea to stop the skin condition but needing something to help with her PCOS, Tesh (reluctantly) went back to Diane. Despite it not being great for her weight or for completely helping the pain, it helped slightly so it was better than nothing.\nAs time went by, Tesh was eager to find the right pill for her. She didn’t mind trying different ones as it was important to her physical and mental health that the pain stops. By now, and almost five years since she first started Diane35, the pain was extreme. “A hot water bottle couldn’t even relieve the pain. I took the tablets [too] but still, no relief.”\nShe adds, “I even vomited from the pain. I’d just stay in bed for the entire day and standing up was too much.” Another symptom to get worse was period poo. “I would dread going to the toilet. I get diarrhoea when I have my period. When I’m out with friends I would skip the salad (I love salads) and skip the coffee (I also adore coffee).” She says it definitely affected the days she would schedule meeting up with friends and going out. “I would always have tissues and wet wipes handy when I have my period.”\nEven though she was so uncomfortable and conducting everyday tasks was difficult, Tesh was worried she was just being overdramatic. She had already had two ultrasounds, so it must just be normal PCOS and period pain? Was she just not handling it as well?\nThird time lucky\nFinally, the third time was a charm. Tesh managed to see a helpful doctor for the third and final doctor who assured her they would do everything they could to find the root of the cause. “One doctor was very helpful. She said she wouldn’t stop until we found the right one.”\nTo her relief, the third ultrasound found that Tesh had in fact been living with endometriosis – an often painful disorder in which tissue similar to the tissue that normally lines the inside of your uterus — the endometrium — grows outside your uterus. While it’s not nice to hear that you have another health condition to tackle, Tesh was pretty relieved to know that she wasn’t overreacting. “I [now] know that it’s not all in my head. But knowing the diagnosis gave me an answer that no, it’s not normal.”\nShe says she had an inkling before when she had been researching it as a lot of her symptoms ticked all of the boxes. In addition, her mum also suffers from endometriosis and so she learnt a lot from her before being diagnosed.\nIn an attempt to find a pill that would help with her endometriosis, Tesh was prescribed Cerazette. “The first pack gave me a lighter period. The pain was still bad but not as much. The second pack changed my life. I didn’t have my period meaning, NO PAIN!”\nShe adds, “I could finally function. I could cook as much as I wanted to. Simply, I could finally move. I can go to the bathroom without any pain. I can sleep without waking up to vomit. I can live like a 25-year-old. I can stop counting the days and dreading the days before my period.”\n\n\n\nThis blog is a part of The Lowdown’s My Contraceptive Journey series.

        "Title": "My contraceptive journey: Let&#8217;s talk about lichen sclerosus",
        "Content": "\nWhat’s lichen sclerosus?\nI’m Lena and I’m 45 years old. I was diagnosed with lichen sclerosus (LS) at 29.\nLS is an auto-immune condition which is fairly common in postmenopausal women, but not generally associated with younger age groups. However, it can, and it does, affect people at any age. As with any other auto-immune disease, the condition arises from an abnormal immune response to a normal body part, resulting in the immune system mistakenly attacking a person’s body. The cause is unknown.\nLichen sclerosus means that patchy, white skin is thinner than normal around the vaginal area. The symptoms can cause redness, an itchy vulva, swollen labia, sore vaginal opening, discomfort, tearing, bleeding and very painful sex.\nBefore my diagnosis, these symptoms created a great deal of anxiety for me. Sex started to become really painful and the whole area felt really raw. I thought it was down to the fact I had a very small frame – it got to point where I would dread physical contact. I knew something wasn’t right, but I wasn’t sure what the problem was.\nGetting help for lichen sclerosus\nWhilst many people experience these symptoms, it can still be really difficult to talk about and often the symptoms are mistaken for other more well-known conditions.\nI think of myself as one of the lucky ones. I have an incredible OBGYN so I was able to get a diagnosis quickly, and was given steroid creams and a barrier cream which helped to manage my symptoms fairly well.\nIt was only after I had my children over a decade later that the condition really flared up, my symptoms began to worsen, and the creams stopped working.  The area felt tender and there was bleeding and tearing. I didn’t want to have intercourse. Sex was excruciatingly painful, made worse by vaginal atrophy – a thinning and drying of the vaginal walls which happens when the body makes less oestrogen.\nThat had an adverse effect on my mindset and confidence as I thought that this would now be my life. How would I sustain my marriage? I started having all sorts of really dark thoughts. Starting my perimenopause journey over two years ago also made it 100 times worse.\nI was desperate for some help, and by this time my OBGYN was involved in pioneering mesenchymal stem cell work for vaginal regenerative treatment. It was known as LIPOGEMS, a minimally invasive treatment that uses your own natural repair fat cells to treat your problem areas, in this case, the vagina.\nThis process helps to repair damaged tissue, reduce inflammation and improve blood flow. When my doctor told me about the treatment I jumped at the chance.\nLipogems as a treatment for lichen sclerosus\nI was one of the first patients in the UK to try Lipogems. To be honest, I didn’t even hesitate in saying yes to this experimental treatment. I trusted my OBGYN implicitly. She delivered both of my children and had always been incredibly vocal about the importance of women’s health.\nI am happy to say that Lipogem has been a huge success for me personally. After the healing period of a few weeks, I no longer felt any pain. I didn’t have any tearing. I felt normal, like I hadn’t felt in years. It has cleared up all of the symptoms I was experiencing so that I no longer have dryness, itchiness or any pain during intercourse.\nI felt a massive sense of relief and was really happy that I could resume a healthy physical relationship with my husband. Of course, this has also had a really positive impact on me emotionally.\nSince the procedure, I had checkups every three months for the next year, which further reassured and supported me.\nSharing the experience and helping others\nAs it is often the way, I’ve found the more I talk about it, the more I find younger women suffering from LS symptoms.\nI have been really keen to share my story and raise awareness of LS. By sharing my positive experience of the Lipogems treatment, I’m hoping that those who are experiencing perimenopause or going through the menopause realise that there are options to explore when it comes to treating these unpleasant symptoms. I also want to raise awareness that many younger people can suffer from LS too. In fact, it can also start at pre-puberty age.\nThe group of women who have had the treatment so far all resulted in really positive outcomes and we are all between 23 and 79 years old.\nSome final advice\nA piece of advice I’d like to give to anyone suffering from these symptoms is to not be scared to ask for help, as leaving it for months and years only exacerbates the situation. As many GPs don’t have this area of expertise, ask to be referred to a gynaecologist from the start.\n\nThis blog is a part of The Lowdown’s My Contraceptive Journey series.

        "Title": "The Future of Male Birth Control",
        "Content": "\n👀If you think you’ll enjoy this blog, make sure to check out our newsletter for more:\n\nDespite male contraceptives being studied since the 1970s, as it stands, there are no commercial hormonal male contraceptives and unfortunately it seems this will be the same for years to come. But why is this the case?\nIt’s not news that both socially and culturally, women are seen to have more responsibility when it comes to contraception. The fact that there are a plethora of contraceptives available to women compared to two male options solidifies this idea. Due to this disproportion, it is unsurprising that research finds women to be responsible for the planning and execution of contraception the majority of the time. Plus, even when taking into account shared methods such as condoms, women still remain disproportionately involved in managing their use.\nHowever, this is not necessarily due to male unwillingness and most men are open to using contraception. A survey reported 55% of men actually want to try hormonal contraceptives. \nHere is the lowdown on everything you need to know about the future of male contraception.\nCurrent male birth control\nVasectomy\nA vasectomy is a simple surgical procedure which is done under local anaesthetic, usually at a GP practice or sexual health service, and can be done privately. It usually takes less than 15 minutes and is 99% effective.\nIt blocks or cuts a man’s sperm duct (vas deferens), to prevent sperm mixing with semen and leaving the body. It does not affect sexual function or ability to ejaculate.\nMale condom\nThe male condom, a rubber sheath used to cover the penis during intercourse, is probably one of the oldest forms of contraception. It can be up to 98% effective depending on how well it is used. It also protects against sexually transmitted infections.\n\nThe challenges of researching a better male contraceptive\nThere is an ethical issue for researchers in the field of male contraception. Pregnancy is one of the most risky things a woman will do in her life, and therefore the risks of using contraception are almost  always better than the risks associated with pregnancy. For example there is a small increased risk of blood clots on the combined pill, but when weighed with the potential risk of blood clots in pregnancy, we consider this as an acceptable risk.\nThis isn’t the case for men, as they are taking a contraceptive with potential risks or side effects to prevent risk of harm to another person i.e. preventing pregnancy in their partner. \nAnother issue is that women only ovulate on average 12 times per year and so stopping this is easier than preventing sperm production occurs with each ejaculation. Men can produce pretty much unlimited sperm throughout the year.\nThe future of male contraceptives\nThe current methods of male contraception are clearly from one extreme to another, with a vasectomy being classed as ‘permanent’ (although it can be reversed in some cases) whereas a new condom needs to be used for every sexual encounter. Researchers have been trying to bridge the gap for some time now with varying success, developing hormonal methods similar to the range of female contraception available. Finding better male contraceptives has been named in the top 10 priorities for contraception research.\nHormonal male contraceptives\nThe most common method used in developing male hormonal contraceptives include using both testosterone and progestogen in order to “switch off” sperm production. This means the body will produce semen without sperm or with too little sperm to cause fertility. These slightly differ from hormonal female contraception which usually takes a week to become effective, as it can take a few months to suppress sperm production. Male hormonal contraception has been developed in a few different forms with varying levels of success, these studies are discussed below.\nHormonal injections\nMen are given an injection every 8 weeks to suppress the production of sperm. Hormonal injections have been found to be 98% effective in preventing unwanted pregnancy, which is similar to effectiveness of female hormonal contraceptives. Plus, after a year of stopping the injections, 94% of men had recovery of sperm concentration, showing evidence for its reversibility and three quarters reported they would be happy to continue using the method if it was available.\nHowever, many trials have ended early due to adverse side effects such as acne, mood swings and the development of mood disorders (sound familiar?). It would be interesting to see how many trials for current female contraceptives would be ended early for the same reasons if they were to be trialed now.\nMale contraceptive pill\nSimilar to female oral contraception, the male pill would have to be taken daily. A 2019 clinical trial found this to effectively reduce sperm, without any severe side effects (only mild reports of fatigue, headaches and acne). However, much more research is needed to detect long term outcomes as this study only observed the effects over 28 days despite the fact it takes at least 60-90 days for optimal sperm suppression. Don’t get too excited about this just yet, the researchers suggest safe, reversible hormonal male contraception should be available in about 10 years.\nMale contraceptive gel\nTopical gels which are applied daily to the shoulders and chest have shown promising results as a new male hormonal contraceptive. Trials have passed human safety tests and human clinical trials, the gels were more acceptable for men with 56% satisfaction rates.  Unlike the injection, the gel is metabolised by the body quicker, leading to less adverse side effects. \nNon-hormonal male contraceptives\nOrganisations such as the Male Contraceptive Initiative are working to raise awareness and advance the development of new non-hormonal male contraceptives. Research suggests a non-hormonal male contraception called Smart RISUG (reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance) is not far off, predicted back in November 2019 to be ready in just 6 months (add that to the list of things that Coronavirus has taken away from us). Final trialing of the non-hormonal male contraceptive injection is currently underway in India and is also being tested in China, Bangladesh and the USA.\nWhat is it and how does it work?\nRISUG is similar to a vasectomy as it blocks the sperm duct, preventing sperm from mixing with the semen and leaving the body. Instead of cutting the sperm duct, RISUG works by an injection of non-hormonal chemicals partially blocking it and deactivating sperm before they leave the body. RISUG is the best of both worlds; working as a long-term contraceptive, which lasts up to 13 years but can also be dissolved if and when the patient wants.\nThe method has been found to have high sustained contraceptive efficacy with no significant adverse effects as seen experienced while using hormonal methods. Plus, while hormonal methods can take around 3-4 months to be effective, RISUG can be effective in as little 1!\nThe future of male contraception\nAlthough it is unclear how long it will be before a new male contraception method will be available commercially, current research is promising. Hopefully in the years to come, this will continue with more rigorous, extended clinical trials to confirm the efficacy and safety of both hormonal and non-hormonal male contraception. Increasing men’s opportunity and contraceptive options will help to balance the responsibility for preventing pregnancy and provide reproductive autonomy for men and women.\nIf we’ve peaked your interest, check out our podcast episode on male contraception!\n\n\n\n  \n",

This contraceptive does not need to be inserted into the vagina or taken orally, meaning in terms of convenience, it’s already a winner.  If you’re done with having to remember to take the pill every day and also cringe at the thought of the coil, then this convenient contraceptive could be the answer to all of your prayers!\nRemember, the only contraceptive that also protects you from sexually transmitted infection is the condom!\nWhat is the contraceptive injection?\nThe contraceptive injection contains a hormone called progestogen which is similar to the hormone our body produces.\nThere are three types of injection;\n\nDepo-Provera is the most commonly given in the UK and lasts for 13 weeks\nSayana Press also lasts for 13 weeks and is a newer option which can be self-injected\nNoristerat  only lasts 8 weeks and is not commonly used in the UK.\n\nCheck out our blog comparing Depo-Provera and Sayana press.\nHow effective is the contraceptive injection?\nThe contraceptive injection is in the group of long-acting reversible contraceptives which have the highest protection rates against pregnancy. With perfect use, i.e. you don’t miss or are late for a jab, the injection is 99% effective.\nHow does the contraceptive injection work?\nThe injection steadily releases the hormone progestogen into your bloodstream. It prevents pregnancy in three ways – by stopping ovulation, by making the fluid in your cervix thicker (which makes it more difficult for sperm to enter the womb), and by preventing the lining of your womb thickening enough for an embryo to grow in it.\nHow do I get started on the contraceptive injection?\nYou can get the injection from your GP, practice nurse or local sexual health clinic. You can also now buy the Sayana Press injection through The Lowdown website.\nYou will be asked questions about your past medical history and your family history. It is important to make sure there is no risk of pregnancy when you start the injection so you should avoid sex or use another method of contraception from your last period or in the 3 weeks leading up to the injection.\nYou can then start the injection at any time during your period cycle. If you have it within the first five days of your cycle, you will be protected from pregnancy straight away.  Any other time in your cycle and you’ll need to use condoms for 7 days before it is effective. \nIf you are switching from another hormonal method of contraception you should seek advice from a healthcare professional about when to start and whether to use additional contraception for the first 7 days. \nYou can have the injection straight after giving birth or pregnancy. The contraceptive injection is safe to use while breastfeeding and has no effect on milk production.\nYou will be given the injection as you would a standard jab.\n\nDepo-Provera can also sometimes be given in the buttock or arm.\nSayana Press is injected beneath the skin at the front of the thigh or abdomen. You can be taught how to give yourself the injection, rather than having a doctor or nurse give it to you. \n\n\nHow do I stop the contraceptive injection?\nBefore you get the injection, it’s good to know that it can take between several months to a year for your fertility to return to normal after stopping. \nTo stop, all you need to do is not have your next injection – if you don’t want to get pregnant then you should use another method of contraception from the day that your next injection would have been due. \nAlways remember to take folic acid and vitamin D (buy from Amazon) if you are planning a pregnancy. These are Amazon affiliate links for supplements our doctors recommend – we earn a small commission too ❤️\nContraceptive injection pros and cons\nPros\n\nA contraceptive that doesn’t need to be taken daily\nIt’s not affected by other medicines including antibiotics\nIt is not affected by vomiting or diarrhoea\nDoesn’t interrupt sex\nGreat for stopping periods, 47% of women at 12 months of using had no bleeding. This may also help people with endometriosis, heavy bleeding or premenstrual syndrome (PMS)\nSafe to use whilst breastfeeding and straight after pregnancy\n\nCons\n\nThe injection can impact your periods, causing them to be heavier, lighter, shorter or irregular which may not be acceptable to you.\nThose at risk of weight gain – see section below\nPotential impact on bone health – see section at end of blog\n\nWho should use the contraceptive injection?\nPeople who:\n\ncannot use contraception that contains oestrogen\ncannot remember to take a pill every day\nare breastfeeding\nwant their periods to stop or get lighter\n\nWho shouldn’t use the contraceptive injection?\nPeople who:\n\nwant their fertility to return to normal immediately after finishing on a contraceptive or planning pregnancy in the next year\ndon’t want their periods to change\nare at risk of osteoporosis (we talk about what that means in a later section)\nare needle phobic\nare on blood thinners like warfarin should try the Sayana Press rather than Depo-Provera as less chance of severe bruising\nhave breast cancer\nsevere liver disease\n\n\nSide effects\nAs with all contraceptive methods, people may experience a range of different side effects or none at all. The injection can’t be removed from your body. If you have any side effects, you have to be prepared for them to continue during the eight or 13 week period, and for some time afterward.\nThe below side effects are some of the most frequently reported from users of the contraceptive injection;\n\nVaginal dryness \nEnlarged breasts \nTender breasts \nVaginal discharge \nBack pain \nLoss of sex drive\n\nCheck out our reviews for more information on possible side effects of the injection.\nHow will the contraceptive injection affect my periods?\nThe contraceptive injection can impact your periods, causing them to be heavier, lighter, shorter or irregular. The majority of women experience no periods altogether. In research studies nearly 50% of women have no periods at all after using the injection for 12 months. These side effects are temporary and your period should go back to normal within a few months of your last injection, although for some women this can take up to a year after stopping.\nAfter the injection has been given, you will only need to go back to your doctor or nurse if you have any problems or when you need a new injection. If you are using the Sayana Press (which you injected yourself at home), you only have to go back to the clinic annually because you will be given a year’s supply.\nWhat are the issues about weight gain with the injection?\nThe injection is the only method of contraception where weight gain is a proven potential side effect that women should be counselled for. If you are under 18 with a BMI of over 30 when you begin using the injection or if you gain more than 5% of your body weight within six months of starting the injection as you are more likely to continue gaining weight. \nWhat does this mean to me? We suggest that you keep a close eye on your weight during the first 6-12 months of using the injection. If your weight is going up and you are unhappy with it then the contraceptive injection may not be right for you.\nSee our blog all about weight gain and loss on contraception.\nWhat are the issues about bone health and osteoporosis?\nThis is a really good question and often one that confuses contraception users as well as doctors and nurses alike. Unfortunately, at The Lowdown we hear of people being turned down for the injection based on this issue of bone health. Hopefully, this section can help dispel the myths around how the injection affects bone health.\nWe talk about bone health in terms of bone mineral density (BMD) which is how strong or thick your bones are. This can be affected by lots of things including getting older, being very underweight, smoking, low physical activity, drugs like steroids… the list goes on… The injection is linked with a small drop in your bone mineral density which recovers when you stop using it. \nOsteoporosis is a term for a medical condition where the bones become brittle and fragile. This puts you at risk of breaking bones.  The contraceptive injection does not give you osteoporosis. There were no links found between using the injection and getting broken bones. \nWhy all the worry? If people are at risk of getting osteoporosis, you don’t want to have any extra bone thinning even if it is just whilst on the contraceptive injection. This means that people with the following risk factors should probably only use the injection for the shortest period of time. \n\nIf you or a close family member have osteoporosis\nIf you have very low weight or anorexia\nIf you are a heavy smoker\nIf you are a heavy drinker\nIf you are on long-term steroids\n\nIf you haven’t fully finished growing yet then you might want to look at other contraceptive methods until you have, usually around 18 years old but we are all different. If you’re over 50 you’ll be advised to switch to a different method until the age of 55 or the menopause. \nBut remember it is your choice and you have the right to decide about your risks. Being pregnant isn’t great for your bones either!\nIf you want the injection, look at ways to keep bones healthy, for example, stopping smoking, doing exercise or taking vitamin D is great for your bones. You will have a regular review with your doctor or nurse to check you are doing all you can to keep your bones strong.\nMaddie is an English Language and Linguistics graduate who is passionate about writing.

        "Title": "My contraceptive experience: Rigevidon vs Microgynon",
        "Content": "\nEveryone’s journey with the contraceptive pill is different. For some it’s the best thing ever, while others find it wreaks havoc with their mental and physical health. It is quite common for their GPs to switch patients to another pill if they’ve been on the same one for a long time, containing exactly the same ingredients, sometimes at a lower cost. So is Rigevidon the same as Microgynon? Microgynon is a very common type of ‘starter’ pill that is often prescribed because it contains a standard dose of oestrogen and a progestogen with a lower risk of blood clots that other combined pills. It contains the same ingredients as Rigevidon and Ovranette and has been around and researched for years. Sometimes, switching between brands won’t have any impact on the person taking it. However some users have found that identical pills of different brands, i.e. containing the same ingredients, have caused significant changes to their moods. Here, Leah Barron Stevens shares her contraceptive journey.\nAnxiety or the pill?\nWhen I was 16 years old, I began my first course of oral contraceptives with a pill called Microgynon 30. Aged 19, I switched to Rigevidon. Around this time, I started noticing physical and emotional changes; it was not long after I chose to come off Rigevidon that I began to feel better.\nAlthough I am quick to stress that my experience with both pills was largely positive, I feel that my story is worth sharing because it exemplifies an ambiguity faced by many other women in my life: we can’t always confidently distinguish between long term contraceptive treatments and other factors affecting mental and physical health. Given that the Sexual and Reproductive Health Services estimated 42% of UK females were using the pill in 2018, and that, in this same year, nearly 1 in 4 women reported suffering from mental illnesses, it’s fair to say that many other women will have found themselves living in the intersection of these data sets and wondering how one relates to the other.\nDid my change in contraception contribute to a period of poor mental health? Was my nausea, fatigue and blurry sight spurred on by artificial hormones or simply the result of unrelated, social anxiety? Was it my counselling alone, or this alongside my decision to come off oral contraceptives completely, that allowed me to emotionally recover? I am still not sure of the right answers to these questions but hopefully, by sharing my experiences, I can give other females greater perspective with which to understand their own contraceptive journeys.\nGoing on the pill\nWhen I initially went to see my doctor about contraception in 2013, I was in my first serious relationship and, like almost every other teenage girl having sex for the first time, I was confused about the great many varieties of contraception but even more petrified about the possibility of unplanned pregnancy. I don’t know whether my experiences were typical, but it’s worth noting that this initial appointment made me feel very uncomfortable. My doctor said little to reassure me that I was doing the right thing and asked if my parents knew that I was seeking contraception in what I found to be quite a derogatory tone.\nI felt embarrassed, despite the fact that I was 16 and well within my rights to seek medical guidance on this issue alone, and consequently lacked the confidence to request the full range of information about my contraception options. I walked away with a prescription for Microgynon 30, which I used for the next three years.Despite my initial anxiety, this proved to be a good decision for me. I did not experience any significant side effects and Microgynon 30 allowed me to live free of anxiety about pregnancy between the ages of 16 and 19.\nMy Transition to Rigevidon\nBecause I was happy with Microgynon 30 during this time, I did not initiate a change in oral contraceptive until I was prescribed Rigevidon instead, aged 19. I was told by my doctor that the pill contained exactly the same active ingredients as my previous pill; it was essentially just a cheaper version of the same thing.\nOn Rigevidon, I enjoyed similar benefits as before. I did, however, begin experiencing some minor physical symptoms, alongside more substantial emotional changes around this time. I found myself feeling more anxious and experiencing a more erratic mood, alongside physical changes such as nausea, blurry vision and fatigue. Of course, my personal circumstances had changed a lot between the ages of 16 and 19. By this point in my life, I was struggling increasingly with social anxiety. (You can see more on Rigevidon reviews here)\nLooking back, many of the physical changes I experienced could merely have been indicative of my emotional state. However, I was also suspicious that my contraceptive switch could be playing part in my growing anxiety; although the active ingredients were the same, I wondered if it was possible that some inactive ingredient present in Rigevidon was causing noticeable changes in my body.\nComing off the pill\nBecause of my suspicions about Rigevidon and my desire to recover as soon as possible, I made the decision to come off the pill at the same time as having counselling for my anxiety. Soon afterwards, I found that my anxiety had become a lot more manageable and my physical symptoms had subsided too. Ever since this time, I have stopped taking contraceptive pills and have been a lot more comfortable knowing that I am no longer putting artificial hormones into my body.\nAlthough I can’t be sure exactly how these hormones affected me to begin with, removing them from the equation makes me feel more in control of my mental health and my ability to read my own body. Even if the pill had never been affecting my mood, Rigevidon made it more difficult to confidently address the sources of my anxiety and, for that reason alone, it was beneficial to my recovery to stop taking it.\nMy Conclusion\nOn the whole, I feel that my contraceptive journey has been a fortunate one. Over the three years I used Microgynon 30 and Rigevidon, I was largely able to get on with life as normal, which I know is not the case for everybody. I am also aware that I am lucky to have had supportive boyfriends; if my boyfriend at the time had not reassured me in my decision to stop taking Rigevidon, then I may not have taken that step.\nFor many of my friends, combined oral contraceptives feel like a losing battle between unwanted side effects and their fear of getting pregnant. In the past, when I have searched for information online, I have been overwhelmed by the volume of traumatic accounts of combined oral contraceptives.\nI felt that my story was important to share, not only because it provides a comparatively positive and ordinary account of Microgynon 30 and Rigevidon for those who are considering taking them, but because it highlights the complexity of evaluating oral contraceptives altogether. My experiences of contraception during these years are wrapped up in the rest of my life experiences, which makes it difficult to cast certain judgments. What I do feel certain about, however, is that the more women are able to share their own stories, the greater our collective understanding of oral contraceptives will be.\n\nRemember, this is all subjective. Some people may be able to relate to Leah’s story and for others, their experience could be completely different. You can read more contraceptive journeys and reviews here.

        "Title": "The contraceptive implant &#8211; Everything you need to know",
        "Content": "\nThe contraceptive implant, also known by the brand name ‘Nexplanon’, or simply as ‘the implant’, is a tiny plastic rod which releases the hormone progestogen and works around the clock to prevent unwanted pregnancies. This method of contraception is often a firm favourite for busy women and those that just don’t have the time to or the memory be taking a pill every single day.\nWhat is the contraceptive implant?\nThe contraceptive implant is a long-acting form of contraception. The contraceptive is made from a small soft flexible rod, which contains ethylene vinylacetate copolymer (plastic) and is placed under the skin on the inside of your upper arm. Conveniently for users, once in place you do not need to worry about it for 3 years.\nHow effective is the implant?\nThe implant is 99% effective against preventing pregnancies, meaning fewer than 1 in 100 women will get pregnant in one year of using it. Unfortunately it won’t protect you against sexually transmitted infections (STIs) so for this you need to use a condom. Read more about the chances of getting pregnant on the implant in our blog here.\n\nHow does the contraceptive implant work?\nThe birth control implant releases the hormone progestogen gradually into your bloodstream. This prevents pregnancy in three ways – stopping ovulation, making the fluid in your cervix thicker (which makes it more difficult for sperm to enter the womb), and preventing the lining of your womb thickening enough for an embryo to grow in it – how clever.\nHow do I get the contraceptive implant fitted?\nDuring your appointment, your doctor or nurse will chat to you about your medical history and make sure that you’re not pregnant. It’s helpful to know that you can have the implant fitted at any time in your menstrual cycle. If it’s fitted within the first five days of your cycle, you will be protected from pregnancy straight away. Any other time in your cycle and you’ll need to use condoms or other contraception for seven days. You can have the implant fitted straight away after giving birth, or after having an abortion or miscarriage.\nYour doctor or nurse will get you to lie down and give you a local anaesthetic injection to numb the part of your upper arm where the implant will be inserted. They use a pencil-like applicator to put it in your arm. If the thought of that is making you cringe– rest assured that it feels very similar to having an injection and you won’t need any stitches (which is always positive).\nThe doctor or nurse will then check your arm to make sure that the implant is in place. You’ll be shown how to feel the implant with your fingers so you can check this too. They will put a dressing on it to keep it clean and dry – ensure this is kept on for a few days and try not to knock your arm. The area may be tender for a day or two and may be bruised and slightly swollen.\nWhen first inserted, you may feel some bruising, tenderness or swelling around the implant. Your periods may become irregular, lighter, or stop altogether. There is also a chance they may become heavier or last longer. At the time of updating this blog (April 2021), 49% of Lowdown users stated that it made their periods irregular and 34% said it stopped their periods altogether. The effect of stopping your periods has no long term impact and is something lots of women consider to be a major plus! \nDoes the implant work to protect against pregnancy straight away?\nThe implant can be fitted at any time during your cycle as long as you’re not pregnant. If fitted in the first 5 days of your cycle you are protected against pregnancy straight away. If fitted at any other time within your cycle you will need to use condoms for the first 7 days. As soon as the implant is removed you are no longer protected from pregnancy and your fertility will return to what is normal for you.\nSee our Lowdown page for more user reviews and related stats about the implant and possible side effects. Also see our guide on implant fitting for more information.\nContraceptive implant removal\nThe implant lasts for three years and must be removed and replaced after three years to continue providing you with protection from pregnancy. You will need to go back to your doctor or nurse to get the implant removed – the procedure is fairly simple and usually only takes a few minutes. If you decide you want another device to be inserted, this can be done immediately after the original one is removed. However if you chose not to replace the implant, you will not be protected from pregnancy anymore, so if you’re not looking to get pregnant, you’ll need to be prepared with another form of contraception.\nThey will inject your arm with a local anaesthetic, then make a tiny cut in your skin and gently pull the implant out. They will put a dressing on the arm to keep it clean and dry and to help reduce any bruising. Check out our survey results to see how long it took most women’s cycles to return to ‘normal’ after having the implant removed, and read about other effects they’ve experienced.\nSee more in our guide to implant fitting and removal.\n\nPros and cons of the contraceptive implant\nPros\n\nEffective for 3 years\nDoesn’t interrupt sex and you don’t have to remember to use it (you do have to remember to get it changed after 3 years though!)\nIt is an option if you can’t use oestrogen based contraception, such as the combined pill, contraceptive patch or vaginal ring\nIt’s safe to use while you’re breastfeeding\nIt may reduce heavy periods and improve painful periods\nYour fertility returns to what is normal for you as soon as you have it removed\n\nCons\n\nYou need to have a small procedure to have it fitted and removed\nYou need to remember when it is due to run out\nOccasionally, the implant is difficult to feel under the skin and may make it more difficult to remove\nIt doesn’t protect you from STIs (only condoms do this)\nYour periods may change in a way that is unacceptable to you\nSome temporary side effects from the contraceptive implant can include headaches, mood changes, libido changes and breast tenderness.\nAcne may worsen\nIt can be affected by some medicines called enzyme-inducing drugs (such as rifampicin and rifabutin, St John’s wort and some anti-epilepsy drugs)\n\nWho should use the contraceptive implant?\nThose who:\n\nwant a long-lasting contraceptive\nmay find it difficult or don’t want to remember to take contraception daily\ncan’t use contraception containing oestrogen\n\nWho shouldn’t use the contraceptive implant?\nThose who: \n\nthink they might already be pregnant\ndon’t want their periods to change\ntake other medicines that may affect the implant\nhave breast cancer, liver disease, arterial disease or a history of heart disease or stroke\nhave unexplained vaginal bleeding (such as bleeding in between periods or after you have sex)\n\nWhere can I get the implant?\nIn the UK you can get the birth control implant for free (even if you’re under 16) from contraception and sexual health clinics, GP surgeries and some young people’s services. Some (but not all) GPs or practice nurses are able to fit and remove implants, but be sure to check with your GP surgery.\nMost sexual health clinics will also be able to do this for you, click to find your nearest one.\n\n\n",

        "Title": "My contraceptive journey: Have I been on the same pill for too long?",
        "Content": "\nBeing a teenager is an exciting time for many. Maybe you meet your first partner, maybe you decide to have sex and maybe, because of this, you want to start using birth control. More often than not, most women choose the contraceptive pill as their first option, but for Amy Butler, she wanted to go onto the implant. However, as it turns out, the implant was not an option. Here, she tells The Lowdown about her contraceptive journey.\nFinding the right pill\nAmy decided to go onto birth control when she was 16 as she had met her first serious boyfriend and had started having sex. Plus, she wanted to tackle other issues that she had read hormonal contraception can often help with. Amy struggled with extremely painful periods and acne, and so was hoping contraception would be like a three-in-one.\nTravelling down to her sexual health clinic was a pretty easy task and Amy had a pretty good idea how it all worked. She says, “I would often accompany friends (teenage girl moral support) and end up chatting to the sexual health nurses who would offer a lot of helpful advice.”\nAfter supporting many friends through the process, Amy decided she would take the plunge and go for the implant. Many teenage girls try the pill as their first method of contraception and so it might have been unusual for Amy to choose the implant. She says most of her friends were a fan of the implant idea and so it felt like the best option. “The coil sounded like a horrific, painful procedure to me when I was 16 and the injection every three months seemed [like] far too much effort and upkeep.\n“But by the time I was seen for an appointment, the clinic was closing for the day.” Instead, and to her surprise, the nurse suggested Amy starts a pill that contains similar hormones to the implant, instead of having to wait for another appointment. “I had preconceptions that the pill would be a bad idea, considering how forgetful I am, but she sounded like she knows what she was talking about so I went with it.” Amy is a pretty easy going person so even though she had initially opted for the implant, she was open to trying a different option.\n“Any research went pretty much out the window when chatting with the nurse; leaving with the pill was definitely not something I anticipated,” she says.\nUnfortunately, Amy almost instantly felt that this first pill was not right for her. She had only been taking it for a short while before side effects started to kick in. “I was on my period for a month, which is definitely not ideal when you first become sexually active with a nice new boyfriend.”\nShe adds, “I was also incredibly emotional (even more so than normal). If you ask any of my friends from college, they will testify that I was not a nice person to be around during that time.” Teenagers are usually moody anyway so add on the effects from the pill and Amy was certainly not herself.\n\n“I wasn’t a nice person”\n\nNot feeling comfortable at all, Amy went back to her sexual health clinic and told the nurse her symptoms. However, the nurse was reluctant to change her pill due to having to ‘wait it out for at least three months’. This is something a lot of females are told when they experience negative side effects from the birth control pill. Freya Cullinane, who shared her contraceptive journey with The Lowdown recently, said that she was made to feel like she had to wait out the bad side effects instead of moving onto something different.\nAmy says, “But after a lot of insisting (and a fair bit of crying), they moved me onto Yasmin, a pill I have been on for the best part of six years and I am a big fan of.” Luckily for Amy, her spots cleared up and her periods became much lighter and less painful. “I do think I have a larger appetite when on the pill, which means my weight is slightly more difficult to control but not impossible.” Apart from that, Amy says she has had no negative side effects.\nSix years and counting?\nWhile the Yasmin pill has been practically perfect for Amy, she does admit her mental health has probably changed, but how, she could not tell you. This is because she has been on it for such a long time, that she can’t really tell now what difference it has made to her mood.\nShe admits she might well be a different person emotionally if she had never started that pill, but whether she would be happier or sadder she isn’t able to tell. “Unsurprisingly, like most women, I find that I am a lot more emotional around my period,” she explains. “However, the few months that I have been off the pill in the past, I haven’t noticed too much of a shift in my mental health and I think, on the whole, it [Yasmin pill] has not had any major negative or positive effects.”\nShe also says that how the pill has affected her physically is a bit of a mystery too. “When I came off the pill for around 3 months a few years ago, I started having pains and cramps (constantly, not just during my period).”\n\nIs it just covering up problems I need to confront?\n\n“After speaking to a gynaecologist, who could find no obvious reasons for the pain, he advised me to go back on the pill and since then the pains have been non-existent. She explains, “I suppose you could say that the pill has therefore improved my physical health, but sometimes I worry it is just covering up a problem that I should probably confront.”\nCuts, cuts and more cuts\nAmy has been on this pill for a long time and trusts it a lot. She came off it for three months a few years ago and did the same at the start of this year, but that’s the only time she has been off it. While the Yasmin pill has worked fine, changing to something different has, of course, crossed her mind. “While I have seriously considered the coil, it seemed easier at the start of the pandemic to go back to a familiar and reliable contraception. Also, it has sorted my skin out again which has made me a lot happier and comfortable with myself.”\nAmy reckons she will try the coil in the future, but not until Covid-19 is dealt with. “However, I find it a lot more difficult to get good advice these days – Sexual Health Clinics have been practically wiped out by NHS cuts. There’s now only one nearby and it’s a challenge to get seen unless you book far in advance. So, for now, while I can get Yasmin prescriptions easily through my GP, I am happy to stick with it.”\nSexual health clinics have faced serious cuts in the last few years. In 2018, several sexual health clinics faced closure or reduced hours as almost half the councils in England planned to cut spending. In a study conducted by The Kings Fund, between 2013/14 and 2017/18, total local authority spending on sexual health decreased by 14 per cent in real terms from £668 to £572 million. This includes spending on STI testing and treatment (down by 10 per cent to £364 million), contraception (down by 15 per cent to £161 million) and sexual health advice, prevention and promotion (down by an eye-watering 35 per cent to £47 million).\nElsewhere, according to a BBC investigation, of the 151 councils that responded to a BBC Freedom of Information request, 72 planned to cut sexual-health funding in 2018-19 compared with 2017-18. Most said any savings would be made through efficiencies, but 16 councils said services would be cut or reduced.\nThis of course has an impact on females getting contraception. Amy most likely isn’t the only one that feels she may as well just stay on the contraceptive she is on currently, instead of going through the potential hassle of finding another clinic. It’s likely there are many other females like Amy who experiences no significant changes to their health but who want to explore their options anyway. How much we know about being on one contraception for a long period of time is arguably still quite limited, therefore, it is understandable that many females feel like taking breaks and changing their birth control methods is sensible.\n\n\n\nThis blog is a part of The Lowdown’s My Contraceptive Journey series.

        "Title": "Menstrual Product Pioneer: Mary Kenner (and why we should stan)",
        "Content": "\nMary Beatrice Davidson Kenner is the person responsible for inventing the sanitary belt, a device which paved the way for female menstrual health products. She made it easier for females to be able to carry on with their day-to-day lives when on their period, without the worry of leaking.\nHowever, as an African American woman living in the 20th century, Kenner was turned away by several potential buyers who showed interest but backed out when they found out she was black. As someone with a passion for making things easier for people, Kenner persevered, but it wasn’t until 30 years later that her invention was patented. A patent is a license conferring a right to exclude others from making and selling the same invention, effectively copywriting the product.Here, The Lowdown explains why we should stan*.\nEarly life\nKenner was born into a family of inventors in Charlotte, North Carolina in 1912. Her father, Sidney Nathanial Davidson, whom she later credited for her interest in discovery, patented a clothing press to fit in suitcases. Her grandfather invented a light signal for trains; however, his invention was stolen from him. Meanwhile, her sister invented and sold board games.Kenner was known to have an eye for making daily activities and tasks easier. When she was six, she helped her mother invent a device to stop their noisy front door from squeaking. Her mother left for work very early in the morning and so Kenner found a solution for her to be able to leave the house peacefully without worrying about waking everyone up.Her family moved to Washington when she was 12 years old and here Kenner would walk the halls of the United States patent and Trademark Office, a federal agency for granting trademarks to inventors, to see if any of her ideas for inventions had already been used.  As it turns out, many of her ideas were original.\nIn 1931, she graduated from high school and started at Howard University, but due to financial difficulties, she was forced to drop out. Following this, she took odd jobs here and there (like babysitting), before landing a position as a federal employee for the government. Driven by a love for inventing, she still continued to work on projects at home.\nThe sanitary belt\nKenner came up with the idea of the sanitary belt in the 1920s. The belt came at a time when female health products were still a taboo subject in America. Tampons were a no-no (even though they existed) and sanitary towels were hard to get hold of and were often expensive. Many females were also still using cloth pads and rags.\nIn addition, neither were appropriate for females who wanted to move about during the days they were on their period. Many were also advised not to leave their homes when they were on their period for fear of leakage. Despite tampons being available, they were seen as improper for a lady to use and so, many were reluctant to do so.\nOne of the obstacles Kenner faced in getting the sanitary belt out there was the issue of getting a patent. These were expensive for people during that time and even today, one could cost several hundred [US] dollars. Frustratingly, patents have an expiry date, meaning that eventually, the product it was protecting will be able to be sold by other companies without the inventor being recognised. It wasn’t until 1957 that Kenner had saved up enough money to buy her first-ever patent for the belt.\nKenner’s invention made it easier for females and ensured menstrual blood would not leak and stain clothes. The technology included a moisture-proof sealed pocket and was unlike anything else seen during that time. Her invention also led to the creation of the maxi pad in the 1960s.With Kenner’s sanitary belt, people could go out confidently.\nPrejudice and racism\nAnother obstacle Kenner faced throughout her career was racism. She put her idea forward to several companies in the hope one of them would buy and manufacture her product. A company called Sonn-Nap-Pack Company showed interest in Kenner, but upon meeting her in person to discuss terms, they rejected the belt as soon as they saw she was black. America in the 1950s was an extremely toxic and difficult environment for black people. Black and white people lived very separate lives, and privileges and advantages that were allowed for white people were usually denied for black people.\nRacism and prejudice against Kenner made it extremely difficult to sell her product which would help levy her invention. Unfortunately, because companies were so reluctant to work with her, her patent expired, allowing manufacturers and buyers to use the sanitary belt and sell it off as their own. This sadly meant that Kenner never actually made any money from the sanitary belt herself.\nThe belt was a revelation for female hygiene during a time when they had limited options and while females were enjoying using the new product, its inventor became a florist and opened her own shop. Kenner worked as a florist for more than two decades and ended up having four flower shops scattered around Washington DC.\nMore inventions\nDespite the frustration of not being recognised for her invention, Kenner’s passion for creativity stayed alive and she continued to invent things later on in her life.\nIn 1976, when her sister became sick with multiple sclerosis, Kenner successfully patented a serving tray that would attach to her wheelchair. Not only that but in the late seventies, Kenner won a patent for a toilet-tissue holder which gave people access to the loose end of a roll. It was designed to be more accessible to visually impaired people and people with arthritis.\nKenner won her fifth and final patent in 1987 for a back washer. This was an invention that could be easily mounted onto a shower wall or bath and would allow people to wash hard-to-reach areas.\nUndeterred by her setbacks, Kenner ended up filing five patents during her lifetime, more than any other African American woman. She certainly changed the way society views female hygiene and made it easier for people to handle many day-to-day tasks.\nTo stan: To be a huge fan of or express extreme support for something or someone.\nPhoto credit: Ruby Love\n\n",

        "Title": "The Combined Pill &#8211; Everything you need to know",
        "Content": "\nThe combined pill is often the first method of contraception most of us started on. It is an extremely popular method of contraception due to its accessibility and simplicity, as well as the many different brands available offering lots of choice. Many women also turn to the pill not only as a contraceptive but for help with other problems. This magic pill might be small, but certainly packs a punch when it comes to controlling acne, periods and hormones – so definitely isn’t just a one-trick pony!\n✔️ If you think you’ll find this blog informative, make sure to check out our newsletter for more:\n\nWhat is the combined pill?\nThe combined pill, also known as ‘The pill’, is an oral contraceptive is taken daily. It contains artificial versions of women’s hormones oestrogen and progesterone. There are many different brands of pill (including Rigevidon, Microgynon and Yasmin birth control pill), but generally they are designed to be taken in three main ways which all differ slightly.\nMonophasic pills:\nEach pill has the same amount of hormones in it. One pill is taken each day for 21 days and then no pills are taken for the next 7 days. During this break you experience a withdrawal bleed (like a period). For most brands you can choose to shorten this break or miss it out altogether (and avoid a withdrawal bleed).\nMultiphasic pills:\nOne pill is taken each day for 21 days, but each pill provides different levels of hormones. No pills are taken for the next seven days. Phasic pills need to be taken in the correct order.\nEvery day (ED) pills:\nThere are 21 active pills (containing hormones) and seven inactive pills (also known as ‘dummy’ pills, containing no hormones) in a pack – they are identifiable through different colours. One pill is taken each day for 28 days with no break between pill packets. ED pills need to be taken in the right order.\nHow does the combined pill work?\nThe pill prevents pregnancy in three ways – by stopping ovulation, by making the fluid in your cervix thicker (which makes it more difficult for sperm to enter the womb), and by preventing the lining of your womb thickening enough for a fertilised egg to implant into it.\nHow effective is the pill?\nIf the pill is taken correctly (meaning you don’t miss any), it is over 99% effective.\nWhat are side effects of the pill?\nMinor side effects of the pill can include mood swings, nausea, tenderness in breasts and headaches. Despite what people may say, 46% of The Lowdown users report no change in weight and only 25% state they had gained weight after being on the combined pill. After much debate, there is no proof that the combined pill CAUSES weight gain. Research does admit that women can put on weight while using the combined pill, but this is thought to be due to natural weight gain as part of ageing that would happen normally without contraception.\nThere is a very low risk of serious side effects such as blood clots and breast or cervical cancer. The pill does not protect against STIs, but luckily the trusty condom can be used alongside this contraceptive to avoid any sexually transmitted illnesses.\n\nHow do I use the combined pill?\nThe combined pill needs to be prescribed and is not something available over the counter. Before you are prescribed the pill, your doctor or nurse will do some tests to ensure you are safe to go on it. They will check your medical history, make sure you’re not pregnant, check your height and weight and take your blood pressure.\nMost women can start the pill at any time in their menstrual cycle. If you start your pill within 5 days of starting your period you will be protected from pregnancy straight away (if you have a short cycle then speak to your doctor or nurse). At any other time in your cycle you will need to use condoms or avoid sex for 7 days before you are covered. Make sure you read the packet carefully and speak to a health professional if switching from another hormonal contraception method. There are special instructions for starting the pill if you’ve just had a baby, abortion or miscarriage.\nYou will normally be given a prescription for three months initially and will need to go back to your doctor for annual check-ups (i.e blood pressure).\nIt’s important to take the pill around the same day every day – for example, first thing in the morning, or before you go to bed at night. It can often be helpful to associate it with something else in your routine, i.e when you have breakfast, or after you’ve brushed your teeth. You could also keep it somewhere that you look everyday, i.e makeup bag. But if you do have the memory of a fish, you could just set an alarm on your phone to ensure there’s absolutely no way you could forget to take your pill!\nMost types of combined pill were designed to be taken for 21 days followed by a 7 day break during which you’ll experience a withdrawal bleed (like a period). For most brands you can choose to shorten this break or miss it out altogether (find out more here ).\nWhat happens if you miss a pill?\nIf you miss a pill or pills, or you start a pack late, this can make the pill less effective. The chance of getting pregnant after missing a pill or pills depends on when the pills are missed and how many pills are missed. Check the NHS website for advice on what to do if you miss a pill.\nIf you vomit within two hours of taking the pill, it may not have been fully absorbed into your bloodstream. Take another pill straight away and then the next pill at your usual time. If you continue to be sick, keep using another form of contraceptive until you’ve taken the pill again for seven days without vomiting. Very severe diarrhoea (six to eight watery stools in 24 hours) may also mean that the pill won’t work properly. Keep taking your pill as normal, but use additional contraception, such as condoms, while you have diarrhoea, and for two days after recovering. Check out more information here.\nHow do I stop using the pill?\nStopping the pill is super easy – you literally just stop taking it. However, be aware that as soon as you stop, you are no longer protected from pregnancy. If you’ve taken 21 consecutive pills, you may ovulate from any time from 7 days after you’ve finished the packet so consider if you need to switch to another method for ongoing contraception.\nCombined pill VS mini pill\nThe main difference between these two pills are the hormones present in them. The combined pill contains two hormones, oestrogen and progestogen, while the mini pill only contains progestogen. The combined pill is designed to be taken once a day for 3 weeks, with 7 days pill-free break, but packets can be taken continuously without breaks. The mini pill is to be taken once a day every day – with no break.\nPros and cons of the combined pill\nPros\n\nYou are able to control when you have withdrawal bleeds or taken the pill continuously and avoid them altogether\nIt doesn’t interrupt sex\nIt can reduce your risk of cancer of the ovaries, womb and colon\nIt can reduce symptoms of PMS\nIt can help improve acne\n\nCons\n\nSome medicines and antibiotics can change the way your body digests the pill (check with a doctor or nurse if you are unsure)\nYou need to remember to take it every day and may forget to take it\nVomiting or diarrhoea can make the pill ineffective\nWith any combined type of hormonal contraception, there is a slightly increased risk of developing blood clots\nIt doesn’t protect against STIs\nSide effects include mood and libido changes, breast tenderness and swelling, headaches, bloating, nausea and vomiting and breakthrough bleeding, although these are usually temporary.\n\n\nWho shouldn’t use it?\nYour doctor or nurse will need to ask about your own and your family’s medical history. The combined pill might not be suitable if:\n\nyou smoke and are 35 years old or over\nyou’re very overweight\nyou take certain medicines\nyou’re breastfeeding a baby less than 6 weeks old\n\nThe combined pill might not be suitable for you if you have ever had a blood clot known as a deep vein thrombosis in the legs or the legs, or risks factors for this, heart disease, stroke or high blood pressure. Other reasons you may not be able to take the combined pill include: migraines with aura, breast cancer or a genetic risk of breast cancer, liver disease, diabetes with complications.\nGenerally at the age of 50 if you are taking the combined pill you will be advised to switch to another form of contraception. This is because at this age the risks of the combined pill are thought to outweigh the benefits.\nWhere can I get the pill?\nContraception is free to everyone on the NHS. The pill is available in contraception clinics, sexual health clinics, GP’s surgeries and some young people’s services. You can also buy the pill through our online pharmacy service, you can read more about The Lowdown’s online order service here.\n\n\nFaculty of Sexual and Reproductive Health (FSRH)\nNHS UK\nFamily Planning Association\n\n\n",

        "Title": "My contraceptive journey: From a miscarriage, to an emergency cystectomy, to living with PCOS",
        "Content": "\nLike many young women who move to university and start a new relationship, Anita Mistry decided to go onto contraception for the first time. However, her experience with contraception has been a difficult one and she has faced several medical complications since. Here, she tells The Lowdown about her journey.\nInterestingly, and unlike most teenage females who start contraception for the first time, Anita chose the implant. “I’m not good at remembering things like taking a tablet every day,” she says, “I’m not good at taking tablets in general.”\n“I think I was allergic to latex condoms and alternatives weren’t as readily available then, so that would never have been an option for me either.”\nAnita explains how she preferred the idea of having something that was practically “100% effective” and that she could forget about. In that sense, she says, the implant was “perfect”. She adds, “I had it done at the university campus medical centre and I remember seeing a lot of literature about it [at the time]. It was the one everyone was raving about because it was something like 99.9% effective.”\nAnita had the implant for a total of six years, the only time being off it was when she got a new one put in. At first, it seemed to work well with her body and she experienced only minor side effects. However, as time went by Anita, explains that she started to suffer from all sorts of health problems. In hindsight, she reckons these problems were down to the contraception.\nDifficult times\nFor Anita, her symptoms with the implant only seemed to get worse. It caused her to have “extremely heavy and irregular periods” and on top of that, when they did come, the pain would be really hard to handle. In addition, Anita’s moods fluctuated when she was on the implant, but it wasn’t until coming off it, she says, that she realised just how different she felt. Then, about 18 months into her second implant, Anita suffered a miscarriage.\nAt first, she thought it was just a really difficult period, but so much blood made her feel uneasy and so she went to get it checked out. “I didn’t know I was pregnant and I still don’t know for sure, but I suddenly had heavy bleeding and huge amounts of blood clots,” she explains. Because of the amount of blood lost, her doctor suggested that a miscarriage was the likely answer. “I fell pregnant but obviously having the implant meant even though it somehow happened, it [the pregnancy] couldn’t continue.”\n\n“I fell pregnant”\n\n“Hearing the possibility that it might have been a miscarriage made me feel strange,” she explains, “I obviously didn’t want a baby at that stage so I was glad it didn’t go through, but it was confusing to have that decision not be mine and for it to be [possibly] caused by something that was supposed to protect me.”\nShe continues, “I felt a bit lost and broke up with my partner shortly after.” Despite having a rough time, Anita chose to finish the three-year term of her implant but decided it wouldn’t be something she would consider going on again.\nTrying the pill\nAfter the implant, Anita decided to try the pill. She wanted to try it out but couldn’t get into the rhythm of taking something every day, but was probably on it for about two years on and off.\nShe tried several pills to see if there was one that worked with her body but didn’t have much luck. She says, “The first one I had caused weight gain and bad skin, and the second one – the progestogen-only pill Feanolla – stopped my periods completely which made me very nervous as I had no idea if I had got pregnant or not.”\n\n“Limited options”\n\nWhen she went back to her GP in the hope of trying another contraceptive pill, Anita says she didn’t have many options. “I wasn’t allowed to have the pill that helped to clear bad skin, which was what I wanted after the first one caused mine to break out,” she explains, “That was because I’m a smoker, and apparently that type of pill can cause blood clots which smokers are more at risk of getting.” Even though Anita says she felt limited with her choice of pill options, she acknowledges that smoking was her choice so she didn’t believe she was let down by her GP.\nAnita adds she wasn’t on one pill long enough to notice a significant difference in her body, but she did sometimes feel lethargic and moody. Her anxiety at the time most likely stemmed from worrying that the pill wasn’t working. “I’ve always tracked my periods on an app which gave me peace of mind regarding when I was due my period and when I was ovulating, but the second pill stopped my periods and so threw this out of whack.”\nEmergency cystectomy\nSadly, her time on the pill quickly came to an end when Anita was rushed to hospital with ovarian torsion and had to have an emergency cystectomy. Anita was told she had a cyst in one of her ovaries which could have been slowly growing over time or developed more recently – there was no way of knowing. “The only reason I found out about it was because the pain was so bad I was rushed to A&E and that’s when they found it,” she explains.\nAnita’s left ovary was almost completely removed because the cyst was so big. The doctors wanted to try keyhole surgery, which might have helped to save more, but ended up having to perform major surgery. Naturally, one of Anita’s biggest concerns was whether she would be able to have children after all of this. Luckily, she was told her chances of getting pregnant had not been changed due to the operation.\nHowever, Anita was told after the surgery that she has polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Polycystic ovaries contain a large number of harmless follicles which are undeveloped sacs in which eggs develop. Because they are undeveloped, ovulation might not be able to occur which can reduce the chances of falling pregnant.\n\n“Will I be able to have children?”\n\nOn top of all of this, Anita is currently waiting to have a large loop excision surgery as doctors discovered pre-cancerous cells at her last smear test (don’t skip a smear test people!). However, because of lockdown, the appointment has been delayed. Worryingly (but understandably) she tells me that this, in conjunction with PCOS and the cystectomy, makes her fearful that she won’t be able to conceive easily in the future.\nAnita still isn’t completely sure why all of this happened to her or whether it’s related to her choice and use of contraception. One thing for sure though, she says, is that she will never take any method of contraception that affects her hormones again.\nPeriods over moods\nFinally, Anita feels like she is on the right contraception for her; the non-hormonal copper coil. She had it put in around eight months ago after starting a new long-term relationship. She had a lot of friends who were on the coil who said it was the best contraceptive they had ever used. “I was nervous about getting it done because most of the information I read said it was painful and only really ideal for women who had had children.” She adds, “When I finally got it done, the actual insertion was fine but I had severe cramps for the next few days.”\nOne side effect Anita does have from the coil is that more than half of her periods since have been heavy and painful. She says, “I spoke to my doctor about this and she gave me a pill to reduce the blood flow (only to be taken during my period so I am not that bothered as I would be if it was a pill every day). It worked well during my most recent period.”\nAnita believes the painful periods are worth it compared to contraception that affected her hormones and subsequently her mental health. “I really regret going on the implant because for six years of my life I wasn’t really me,” she explains, “the relationship I was in then obviously wasn’t meant to be, but I do wonder if things would have been different if I didn’t act the way I did.”\n“I also wondered if that [implant] and the pill had a part to play in the gynaecological complications I have had and struggle with today.” Of course, Anita’s difficult experience may worry some who are on the implant, but what might be negative for one female, could be positive for another. There are many positive experiences with the implant, and many females have shared their story with The Lowdown which you can read here. By sharing Anita’s story, we at The Lowdown hope that people will be able to understand they are not alone.\nDesign by Petra Rabely.\nThis blog is a part of The Lowdown’s My Contraceptive Journey series.

        "Content": "\nDeciding to go onto contraception can be a big decision for any woman and there are many different reasons for her choosing to do so. Here, Danielle Conlon tells of her experience with the implant.\nWhen I got my birth control, I was over the moon! I had recently turned 22, just finished uni and was balancing a lot of fun jobs (and romances) at once. If I’m honest, I wanted to have more control over my body too. I was due to move to Spain to teach a few months later and I was 100% not ready to learn how to ask: “do you have the morning after pill’ in Spanish (I can say it now, but never needed to).\nI’d been apprehensive to get any contraception for years due to horror stories of side effects combined with my inner battle of ‘why do I really have to?’. So, when I eventually made my way downtown to the sexual health clinic, I was on a mission – only to be turned away as, *spoiler alert*, you need to arrive at opening time if you want an appointment that day.\n\n“I opted for a three-year subscription”\n\nInstead, I opted for this simple, free three-year subscription. I loved the first six-month trial but now, I want to cancel it.\nSo, on a new rainy Tuesday morning in May 2019, I returned half asleep to the clinic but finally managed to get myself some contraception.\nIt’s weird how speedy the process is compared to the 3-hour wait at the clinic. The sexual health nurse gave a quick run-through of all the options available. The implant was my first choice because I felt like it was a safe choice in between the pill and the coil. You know when your mum would give you 30p after school on Friday when you were seven, and you had two minutes to make the choice between a Freddo or two small bags of Haribos? Yeah, it was akin to that kind of panic. My friends had (or have) the implant; some hated it, others thought it was the best contraceptive on earth. Now I’m thinking, I should’ve gone for the Freddo.\nHot girl summer\nAfter it was placed inside my arm, I didn’t have many imminent after-effects. I went to work, I could kind of feel hormones travelling across my body; almost like Cinders transforming into Cinderella by the Fairy Godmother’s swish of a wand or Nexplanon. The implant didn’t take long to start changing things about my body. First of all, I stopped having my periods all together. Rejoice! One month without the monthly inconvenience was a dream. After two, three, four, five, six months, I was used to it. I did miss that shared fun of talking to your mates about being on at the same time, or blaming my time of the month for being unnecessarily angry at people on reality TV shows –\n\n“Kim, would you stop crying, there’s people that are dying!”\n\nThere weren’t that many side effects other than the no-period situation. If anything, it was all overwhelmingly positive. I felt more confident, less tired and always incredibly happy. It was Hot Girl Summer, guys, in a big way.\nBut much like an ex without proper closure, the period came back, wanting to get back together.\nThus began my series of unfortunate side effects…\nFor me, what I had experienced in the first six months did a sneaky flip-flop as I went from no periods, no bloating, not a lot of crying to all of those things – multiplied. I was coming on my period every one to two weeks, not only that but they were a lot heavier than normal, my hormones were all over the place and I felt constantly bloated and uncomfortable. It got to the point where my eight-year-old students were asking if I was pregnant – not fun.\nNow I make up for my lack thereof, and my time of the month is now times* of the month (*averagely 2 or 3). All the rest followed.\nAs many say, you don’t really put two and two together in these situations. Yes, I noticed a change in my weight, headaches, no interest in romance and low mood in contrast to how I had been feeling those six months before, but I didn’t think it was the implant’s fault. I blamed Spain. Lots of bread and cheese, horrible storms, my new 9-5 job, homesickness, bad dates – all of these could’ve easily been the culprit.\nIt was a real shaken-not-stirred cocktail of side effects. And it suddenly occurred to me that my birth control could be the problem.\nIt’s not you, it’s me. Or is it?\nMy general wellbeing took a turn in the first few months of this year, which is coincidentally when my irregular periods returned. That ‘new year new me’ attitude never sat well with me and that combined with bad stormy weather and my missing home, I was not interested in my usual sangria silliness. When my wellbeing went a little downhill, it was joined by its not so welcome friends: low confidence and fatigue. Not only that but my relationships were definitely affected by this too. As I said, I didn’t have an interest in romance just as I didn’t have much of an interest in anything at that point. This is when I started to put two and two together, especially considering I used to LOVE dating. It’s one of the things I write about the most, a lot of people know me from my drama queen-esque dates. But when 2020 hit, I was over it.\n\n“Hormones had betrayed me”\n\nIn addition, my period started for the third time that month. That’s when I definitely knew something was up. Once I had realised it wasn’t entirely out of the blue, I instantly felt better. I wasn’t pleased with the fact the hormones had betrayed me after such a good ride, but it was refreshing to know it wasn’t all me. An old date had messaged me asking what happened and why I had stopped speaking to him soon after that and I so desperately wanted to reply saying ‘It’s not you, it’s m-y implant’ but I ignored him instead (oops).\nI had a plan to get my groove back though: I’d get the implant taken out at the Easter holidays when I was back in the UK, start actively trying to get myself out there more, go dancing with friends, attempt ‘couch to 5k’ and I’d be back and better than ever.\nBut guess what? Coronavirus happened. So, just as my mood was brightening and the weather was becoming the hottest I had ever seen in Spain, the country went into full-on lockdown. Now that was out of the blue.\nUpdates\nI’m back in the UK now and do, in fact, still have the little bugger of my implant in my arm. I have been meaning to get it removed, but I’m still waiting until lockdown calms down a little more. Luckily, it hasn’t been an urgent problem and my mood and confidence have been a lot better. A global pandemic puts a lot into perspective. When coronavirus hit, complaining about period pain felt wrong as there were clearly more life-threatening things to be worrying about. That said, I was working less, so I was definitely less stressed and was able to rest up when I did feel poorly.\nGoing to a clinic or to my doctor to discuss my implant didn’t feel like an “essential trip” and so I shied away from making any appointments. I also didn’t want to risk catching or spreading the virus just because my periods were a little unstable; I felt like I could definitely wait the symptoms out.\nLuckily though, as time went by, the symptoms started to become a little more bearable. I still have periods out of the ordinary, which is annoying, but I’m generally a lot less hormonal and bloated. I feel like I’ve learnt to manage it. Of course, when lockdown is over, I will still be getting the implant out!\nUpon reflection\nIt’s a common misconception (excuse the pun) that contraceptives can ‘make you crazy’, ‘make you fat’ or ‘make you depressed’. We should rethink our overuse of words like crazy, insane or using the word fat as an insult. They can for sure affect us in more ways than one, but they don’t ‘make us’ these things. It definitely helped, but we’re more than just a side effect. A small saving grace is that we’re not all in our feelings, alone.\n\nOur bodies are pretty magical, after all.”\n\nContraception CAN change a lot of things but not always. My story will be entirely different from someone who was sitting next to me before my appointment. Unfortunately, we can never know how it’s going to go until we try it. Our bodies are pretty magical, after all.\nWhat I found was, despite double-checking the potential side effects on the NHS prior to getting it, that it hadn’t really phased me. I was eager to get it and the pros outweighed the cons. Although I wouldn’t rate it 10/10 and it will certainly be my first stop when Boris says the UK is Covid-free, I don’t regret it at all.\nThe Lowdown allowed me to consider that there are thousands of ways contraception can go. You can love it, hate it, but at the end of the day, it’s not permanent.\nOf course, and as stated in all contraceptive journey pieces, this is all subjective. As Danielle states above, what might work for one female might not work for another but it’s important we all share our stories so a little more light can be shed.\nDesign by Petra Rabely.\n\nThis blog is a part of The Lowdown’s My Contraceptive Journey series.

        "Title": "My contraceptive journey: How the wrong pill affected everything",
        "Content": "\nManchester-raised Freya Cullinane has tried various contraceptive pills over the years. One particular one affected her so much that it heavily impacted her lifestyle, relationships and happiness. Finding the right pill for your body can be a long and tiring journey, but a relief once you find it. Here, Freya tells The Lowdown about her own contraceptive journey.\nLike many other young women who decide to start contraception for the first time, the pill was Freya’s first choice. Even though she wasn’t having sex at the time, at 17 years’ old she made the decision to go onto the pill to be protected just in case. She also recalls having a holiday planned around that time and wanted to ensure she would not be on her period while she was away (oh the wonderful world of period timings).\n\n‘There was the most info on the pill’\n\nWhen researching what contraception to go on, Freya felt that not only was the pill the best option for her but it was the one that she could get the most information on. The implant wasn’t something she felt was right for her, the injection wouldn’t last long enough and then the coil was something she said she only really knew about up until a couple of years ago. She adds that even if she was aware of the coil back then, she probably would not have gone on it as she described herself as being “a wuss” with that sort of thing.\nNegative side effects\nFreya began her contraceptive journey with the progesterone only pill Cerazette. She explained to the nurse at her local sexual health clinic Brook, a service for 16-24-year olds, that she would like to start the pill and that was the one she was given. It was pretty easy to get an appointment she says, but the clinic also offers walk ins during certain times of the week.\nAt the time, Freya understood that it could take time for her body to get used to the pill and so she tried her best to stay on it. However, soon after starting that pill, she started spotting and bleeding continuously. She managed to stay on it for about six months but after a while could feel that it wasn’t agreeing with her body in the slightest.\n\n  “Spotting and bleeding constantly”\n\nAfter trialling Cerazette, Freya went back to her Brooks centre, explained her symptoms and as a result was given the combined pill Microgynon. Freya recalls it being pretty easy to swap pills but the nurse had to ensure that Microgynon would be suitable. This was because Freya’s mum suffered a brain haemorrhage not long ago. As these can be hereditary it was important that she goes on the right combined pill that would not put Freya at risk of one herself. Luckily for Freya, Microgynon did not pose these risks.\nFinally, Freya felt like she was on the right pill for her. This pill, she says, was ok and agreed with her body. Like with a lot of long-term medication, you have to give it a ‘trial period’ for it to settle into your body. Fortunately for Freya, this pill seemed to not have any significant side effects that were difficult to handle.\nWeight becomes an issue\nFast forward five years down the line and Freya had been contently taking Microgynon all this time and had experienced minimal issues. Like anyone does when they need more contraception, Freya booked an appointment with her GP to get a repeat prescription. In what is a usual part of contraceptive appointments, Freya was weighed but unfortunately she was told that she was too heavy to continue on this pill.\nHearing the news that her weight was affecting her choice of contraception was shocking to Freya. “It was the first time my weight had affected me health-wise which freaked me out,” she says. The way her weight was measured was through her BMI (body mass index) and Freya felt this wasn’t an effective way of measuring how healthy someone is. BMI is calculated by dividing an adult’s weight in kilograms by their height in metres squares and there have been many debates about whether it is an accurate way of measuring obesity.\nNot only was this a hard thing to hear, but had Freya been informed of this when she first started Microgynon then perhaps she would have never been in the position where taking it was out of the question. It was something she had not been aware of up until she was told the pill would not be available for her anymore. Freya wasn’t even particularly large so it was quite a shock that even putting on some weight could affect contraception.\nNo other choice\nBecause of her weight, Freya was given Cerazette again despite it disagreeing with her when she was 17. She says she felt like she was given “no other option” but to go back onto Cerazette and that she would just have to deal with the negative side effects until she was at a lower weight. This time, Freya was in a relationship and so being protected was pretty important. “I just felt like I had to go on it or get pregnant,” she says.\nTo no surprise, the negative side effects of Cerazette started to kick in for Freya imminently. But this time, they were even worse. Not only was she continuously spotting again but her mental health was becoming worse.\n\n  “Either go on it or get pregnant”\n\nIt started to affect her relationship with her then boyfriend. “My behaviour was very much to do with being on that one [pill],” she explained. Her mood swings became a lot worse. “It affected it [relationship] very badly. Mentally, I was getting a lot angrier at him.”\n“We argued a lot more and they [arguments] were more aggressive and heated,” she adds. She also said that their sex life decreased dramatically.Despite having awful symptoms, Freya tried her best to stay on this pill. She was told by her doctor that the symptoms would settle down after six months so, as she says, “you just have to deal with it”. She admits that she felt Cerazette made her depressed.\nNew beginnings\nOnce her relationship ended, Freya came of Cerazette to give her body a break. She instantly felt better and it wasn’t really until she was off it that she realised how much of an effect it was having on her body and mind. Of course, other factors played into her mental health such as the constant friction in her relationship and then the aftermath of it ending. However, the pill certainly was a contributing factor.\nAfter having a break from contraception, Freya decided to try again last Christmas. She was also in a new relationship and so wanted to be protected. After working hard for almost a year, Freya had managed to lose enough weight to go back onto Microgynon. She says hearing that she was too heavy for it before motivated her to lose the amount of weight needed. “It was a relief to be on the right one now because I know I’m a lot healthier and feel a lot better within myself.”\nUpon Reflection\nFor her right now, being on a contraception with some side effects is better than not being protected. However, Freya acknowledges that even being on the right pill for her still has an effect on her mental health.\nWhen looking back at how she felt during and in-between contraception, Freya found that things affect her more when she is on a pill rather than off. “I do seem more hyper-sensitive and emotional than I normally would be,” she explains, “I would say I’m more positive and happier when I’m off the pill.”\n\n  “I’m more hyper-sensitive on the pill”\n\nHowever, she does take into account her situation then and now. She could have felt better because she was out of her relationship, had lost weight and was generally feeling better about her life. It’s not to say she isn’t happy now, but there is definitely a difference.\nOf course, it’s important to know that different pills affect women in so many different ways. As stated in the first contraceptive journey piece, this is all subjective. For Freya, Microgynon is the best fit right now but what may be good for one person, won’t be for another. You can buy the Microgynon pill here at The Lowdown.\nDesign by Petra Rabely.\n\n\n\nThis blog is a part of The Lowdown’s My Contraceptive Journey series.

        "Title": "My contraceptive journey: From implant to eating disorder",
        "Content": "\nAfter getting accepted into university, Melissa Adamou was excited about having the opportunity to make new friends and meet people from different walks of life, as well as starting her degree and getting stuck into her university course. “I was really excited to move to a new city and more away from my family for the first time.” With her newfound freedom, she decided it would be the right time to go on the implant, so took a trip to her local sexual health clinic.\nMelissa didn’t conduct much research beforehand but felt like the implant was the best option for her as there was no pressure to remember to take something every day and once it’s in, it lasts for two years. She told me this was her first experience using contraception other than condoms and that it was extremely easy to book an appointment at her local clinic.\nMelissa described how there was no discussion about other alternatives or about her lifestyle or medical history so that the right contraception for her could be given. “They didn’t really discuss the potential side effects (of the implant) with me before I went and got it done, I pretty much turned up and they put the implant in without giving me any real info on it.” When Melissa first had the implant, she said it was fine. Her periods stopped and she didn’t have to worry about them.\n\nFeeling really down\nBut only a couple of months into having it, she started to feel really low, likening her moods to “constantly PMS-ing”. She felt seriously deflated and sad, almost to the point where she considered dropping out of university. “I was really depressed and tearful all the time,” she said. Due to her low moods, Melissa found herself wanting to journey back home a lot more, but attending university in Bristol and her parents being in Surrey meant it was quite a difficult (and expensive) journey to make.\n\n“It affected my weight too”\n\nAs she was down a lot of the time, Melissa said that it was likely many of her friends noticed her change in moods. This was because she was unhappy for a lot of the time and was traveling home a lot more than what might be expected of a new first year at university. However, she said she didn’t speak to them about it that much so she can’t say for certain.\nNot only were her moods affected but after about six months, so was her physical appearance, or so she certainly felt it was. “It (implant) affected my weight too, I felt like I was putting on a ton of weight which then triggered an eating disorder.” According to the scales, Melissa wasn’t even putting on substantial amounts of weight but the hormones that were being “pumped into” her made her feel like she had.\nConnecting the dots\nIt was a while before she began to connect the dots between her sadness and the implant. Melissa started therapy during university for her depression and eating disorder. It wasn’t until she started to conduct her own research that she connected the dots and realised the implant might be playing a serious role in her depleting mental health.\nHowever, she acknowledged that the implant might not have been the sole reason for her depression and eating disorder, but it certainly was a factor. After all, university can also be a difficult time for many and so there may have been other factors contributing to her extremely difficult time.\nBooking an appointment to get it out was extremely easy. She simply explained to her GP how she was feeling and they took it out “there and then”. Once it was out, Melissa said she felt a lot lighter and happier and everything started to go back to normal. Thankfully, her relationship with food is also a lot better.\nNo more side effects\n\nThe coil has been “fab”\n\nEight years later, my friend can now happily say she has found the right contraceptive for her, which is the copper coil (non-hormonal). She said that this time around, she conducted a lot more research and spoke to a few of her friends who were also on the coil about their experiences. “Luckily, quite a few people I knew had the coil,” she said. It has been “fab”, as she put it. Melissa described having no real side effects so far, just the occasional cramping. Her periods have also surprisingly been a lot lighter despite her expecting them to be a lot worse, after being told this by several people.\nOf course, this is all subjective. What might work for one person might not for another and vice versa. Finding the right contraception for you can be a long journey but it can certainly be worth the wait.\nDesign by Petra Rabely. \n\n\n\n\nThis blog is a part of The Lowdown’s My Contraceptive Journey series.

        "Title": "How to throw the ultimate first moon party for your first period",
        "Content": "\nPeriods. Each month we reluctantly prepare ourselves for a week full of pain, mood swings and binge eating, what’s not to love? On average, Mother Nature comes knocking around 500 times in a person’s life, so it can be difficult to remember back to a time before them.\nStarting your period can be such a terrifying time: the changes, hormones and oh my god – the spots! All these side effects can be incredibly overwhelming and make you feel like you’re the only person that’s ever felt like this. Not to mention telling your parents, which can feel like the most embarrassing thing in the world. \nIt’s no secret that there’s a lack of education around periods, sex and puberty. For most of us, memories of sex-ed classes consist of a teacher putting an ill-fitting condom onto an un-ripened banana, teasing them with questions like ‘Miss, what does fanny mean?’ – not exactly the most informative experience.\nThis lack of education in schools may be why in the past couple of years, parents have decided to take matters into their own hands, and have tried softening the hormonal blow by celebrating their child’s entrance into the world as an official adult by throwing a ‘Period Party’.\nWhat is a period party? \nYep, you heard it. Period Parties – which also go by the name of ‘full moon parties’ and ‘red tent parties.’\nThis new craze burst into the media spotlight a few years ago and gained attention after a tweet went viral. The tweet showed a family throwing their daughter a ‘period party’ after she had aired her fears around starting her period. The tweet gained 14.5K likes as well as receiving lots and lots of comments, and I won’t lie to you; it was definitely a mixed bag of opinions. \nHowever, amongst them were some super positive messages, which included people stating how they had been inspired by the family to recreate their own and how they think it’s amazing that a conscious effort is being made to remove the negative stigma around periods, but like anything, there’s always going to be some differing opinions on the matter. \nOf course, it wasn’t long before celebrities wanted in on the action. Comedian Bert Kreischer spoke openly on American talk show, Conan, of how his daughter came to him insisting that “all the girls are throwing them”. So, like any supportive father, he took it upon himself to organise a party equipped with red food, red drinks and a period themed cake, “it was awesome”, he said.\nSupermodel Tyra Banks also spoke about the recent trend in her book written with her mum, Carolyn London, ‘Perfect is Boring’. Carolyn mentions how she was inspired by a National Geographic programme, in which some cultures held a rite of passage ceremony where the women came together to honour and celebrate the child who had just started her period. “It was a celebration of womanhood, and an acknowledgement of passing into another realm,” she writes.\nCarolyn decided to host a party for Tyra, inviting her friends, getting a cake, decorating the house and putting together a gift basket. She also gave out gift baskets with various menstrual products, explaining hygiene and going into anatomy. Tyra seemed on-board with the idea as she wrote, “I appreciate that my mother never wanted me to be ashamed of anything, or to think that there was something bad or dirty about my body.” \nAlthough this trend is somewhat new in Western societies, coming-of-age ceremonies are common in cultures across the globe throughout history. For example, in Apache culture young girls traditionally take part in a 4-day Sunrise Ceremony, also known as Na’ii’ees, the summer following their first menstruation to mark their transition into womanhood.\nPeriod party ideas\nHere’s a very important, very scientific checklist to follow if you’re looking to throw your own first moon party: \nFood and drink\nThink all the red food…  \n\nCranberry juice or red punch (with red wine for the adults?)\nStrawberries, raspberries and watermelon for fruit kebabs\nJam sandwiches\nRuby chocolate fondue\nVulva cupcakes\nRed candy and sweets\nFinish with a celebratory red velvet cake (bonus points if it’s in the shape of a tampon or other menstrual product!)\n\nPeriod party decorations\n\nRed balloons and banners\nRed moon decor\nUterus shaped piñata\n\nPeriod party games and entertainment\nSet the scene with a cracking playlist full of empowering female artists from Lizzo to Beyonce. Then it’s time to play…\n\nPass the period pad\nWhat’s the time-of-the-month Mr Wolf\nStuck in the blood\nPin the ovaries on the uterus (all the classics!)\n\nYou could even give out ‘first period kits’ to guests complete with sanitary pads, chocolate and hot water bottles.\n\nWhat can we learn from period parties?\nAll jokes aside, these parties are really touching on something quite significant. They’re helping to turn a topic that is often deemed embarrassing or taboo, into something we can (and should) openly talk about. A period party’s main aims are to provide an opportunity to educate children on puberty, periods and sex and allow parents a chance to talk with their kids about the changes their body is going through. \nNo matter how you chose to celebrate this occasion; whether you go all out and get family, neighbours and friends round for a sing and a dance, or just simply taking 10 minutes to sit down and talk about it, it’s important to remember that having your first period is a positive experience – and definitely not embarrassing.\nDon’t be afraid to talk about periods\nTalking about your periods can be a great way to compare what is normal and what is not. If your mum and sister have always had horrible, heavy, painful periods then you might think that it’s the same for everyone each month. \nHowever that might not be the case… There are conditions such as thyroid disturbances, bleeding disorders, fibroids and polyps which can give you heavy periods (menorrhagia). As well as other conditions like endometriosis and adenomyosis which cause severe pain (dysmenorrhea). If your period is having an impact on your quality of life and stopping you from going to school, college or work then have a chat with your GP.\nCheck out our blog about how contraception can help with heavy or painful periods.\n\n\n\n\nMaddie is an English Language and Linguistics graduate who is passionate about writing.

It has a unique design consisting of 17 copper pearls which form a spherical shape  – and it’s half the size of the traditional intrauterine devices (15mm in diameter) (you know what they say about the best things coming in the smallest packages).\nThe frame is coated with polyethylene terephthalate and because of the material used, it is meant to find its ideal position and fit cosily in your uterus to minimize risk of damage and irritation.\nHow does the IUB contraceptive coil work?\nAccording to Ocon Medical, the IUB works by releasing small amounts of copper to provide birth control for up to 5 years. Ongoing surveillance by the manufacturer suggests the IUB  is over 99% clinically effective, similar to copper IUDs, which means less than 1 in 100 women will fall pregnant over 1 year of use.\nThe IUB works in a similar way to standard copper IUDs, which achieve their contraceptive effect by interfering with sperm motility and egg fertilization. Tragic, these millennial sperms can’t even handle 15mm of metal.\nHow is the IUB Ballerine inserted?\nBefore you can get IUB fitted, you must attend a consultation with your healthcare provider in which they must examine you to find the position of your uterus – this involves a pelvic examination by a doctor or nurse.\nOnce that’s out the way, the IUB can be inserted through a small tube, which is then removed. Two removal threads made of Polypropylene which allow the healthcare provider to remove the IUB are attached to the end of the frame and extend into your vagina. These will be trimmed by your healthcare provider for maximum comfort.\nThe IUB stays inside your uterus and protects against pregnancy immediately after insertion. It releases small amounts of copper to provide continuous contraception for up to 5 years.\nThe IUB can be inserted at any time during your menstrual cycle if it is certain you are not pregnant. The makers of the IUB recommend that the best time to get your IUB inserted is the last 2 days of your menstruation when the cervix is naturally more open, and chance of pregnancy is low.\nSome things that might be good to know when considering this as an option is that if your cervix is especially tight, the insertion of the IUB may be painful. If you’re really not good with pain, no need to worry as local anaesthetic or other prevention pain-reducing treatments should be available during placement.\nSide effects immediately or a few minutes after insertion may be: cramping, menstrual type bleeding, feeling faint, nausea and dizziness but these should subside quickly.\n\nHow is the IUB Ballerine removed?\nThe IUB should only be removed by a trained healthcare professional at a GP surgery or healthcare clinic and is done by gently pulling two strings with a medical instrument. The removal process will involve a pelvic examination with a speculum.\nBallerine IUB vs IUD (copper coil)\nThe manufacturers of the IUB had previously suggested a small reduction in cramps and period pain for those using the IUB compared to the IUD but the study has been removed from their website so there is currently no published data on this.\nOn the basis of post-marketing surveillance data, the manufacturer suggests that the IUB appears to have a favourable safety profile and similar effectiveness to other currently available copper IUDs. However data from robust, independent studies comparing the IUB ballerine and copper IUDs is lacking.\nPros and Cons of the Ballerine IUB\nPros\n\nThis is a non-hormonal coil therefore it does not affect the ovulation or the hormonal changes that occur naturally during menstrual cycle\nThe IUB is unlikely to cause the side effects which can be associated with hormonal contraception such as mood swings, changes to libido and possible weight gain\nIt is a highly effective method of contraception\nIt lasts for up to 5 years\nIt is easily reversible and an alternative to permanent sterilisation\nFertility is restored immediately after removal\n\nCons\n\nHeavier, longer periods and spotting between periods can occur – normally for up to 2-3 months\nSometimes difficult removals can occur\nDoes not protect against HIV or STI’s, you will need to use a barrier method such as condoms for this\n\nRisks\n\nThere’s a small chance of you getting an infection during the first 20 days after an IUD is put in – you may be advised to have a check for sexually transmitted infections before an IUD is fitted or at the time it’s fitted\nThere is a very small risk the IUB can go through (perforate) the wall of the uterus meaning you are no longer protected from pregnancy – this risk is higher if you are breastfeeding or have just given birth. In this case the IUB will need to be removed and rarely surgery may be needed\nExpulsion: the IUB may partially or completely fall out of the uterus – this isn’t common, it’s more likely to happen soon after the IUD has been put in and you may not know it has happened. Your doctor or nurse will teach you how to check the threads so you know the IUD is in place.\n\nWhy Should I use the IUB?\nYou might choose the Ballerine IUB if you’re looking for contraception that:\n\nis very effective\nis easy to use\nstops working when you stop using it\navoids using synthetic hormones for contraception\n\nWhy shouldn’t I use the IUB?\nThe makers of the sub advise you should not use the IUB if you:\n\nmight be pregnant\nhave an abnormally shaped uterus – this is rare, your nurse or doctor will examine you to check the shape and position of your uterus before the IUB is inserted\nhave a pelvic infection called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or have current behaviour that puts you at high risk of PID (for example, because you or your partner are having sexual intercourse with multiple partners)\nhave had an infection in your uterus after a pregnancy or abortion in the past 3 months\nhave cancer of the uterus or cervix\nhave unexplained bleeding from your vagina\nhave an infection in your cervix\nhave Wilson’s disease (a disorder in how the body handles copper)\nare allergic to any of the IUB™’s materials (copper, nickel, titanium, PET, polypropylene) \nalready have an intrauterine contraceptive in your uterus.\n\nWhere can I get the IUB\nThe Ballerine IUB is not available in the UK yet – it was meant to be rolled out out in 2020, but Covid-19 has grounded everything to a halt and we are unsure of when this IUB will be accessible to us all. Sorry guys!\nFollow us on Instagram @Get.the.lowdown to stay updated on when it’s available.\nThe makers of the IUB were working hard on spreading the word and training the medical community with the goal of it soon being an option as a form of contraception in every GP surgery across the country.\nFor our friends across the pond, there have been some developments about the US market recently and it looks like it’ll be available there in the next four years.\nIt is currently available in Ireland, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, France, Spain, Belgium, Italy, Poland, Sweden, Norway, Netherlands, Hungary, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Israel, Kenya, Uganda and South Africa.\nNow that you all know the ins and the outs (sorry we couldn’t resist) of the Ballerine IUB you might be thinking this is the perfect option for you, but there are plenty more options around including the hormonal coil.\nWhen it comes to choosing contraception, it’s about finding the perfect one for you.

        "Title": "What is Natural Progesterone?",
        "Content": "\nSo what is Natural Progesterone?\nProgesterone is part of the family of progestogens, a group of hormones made by the human body. Its name comes from its role in supporting gestation (or in simpler terms, pregnancy) and originates from the Latin word “gestare”, meaning “to carry or to bear.”\nWe know what you’re thinking, and it’s a good question: why is something that naturally supports pregnancy used as contraception?\nLet’s break it down. Natural progesterone is not actually used in contraceptives; instead, a synthetic, man-made version of progesterone called a ‘progestin’ is used. These, alongside our natural progestogens, all interact with progesterone receptors in our cells, which can affect and interrupt our cycle in various different ways.\nNaturally occurring progesterone\nMade by the body, progesterone is secreted by the Corpus Luteum on the ovary after ovulation has occurred (a corpus what, you ask? Here’s an article if you’d like to get up to speed). \nProgesterone maintains the lining of the uterus to allow for the implantation of a fertilised egg. If fertilisation doesn’t happen then the Corpus Luteum stops secreting the hormone, the uterine lining breaks down and a period occurs. If fertilisation and implantation do occur, then progesterone secretion continues by the Corpus Luteum until the placenta takes over the majority of hormone production by the eighth week of pregnancy1.\n",

        "Title": "An introduction to your hormones and menstrual cycle",
        "Content": "\nJust a few years ago, talking openly about the menstrual cycle was seen as taboo. Now, it’s at the centre of scientific and political debate, and about time too.\nHistorically, scientific and medical research has failed to include women in its studies, creating a gap in the knowledge of how our menstrual cycles affect our health and wellbeing. Slowly (but surely!) a change is occurring thanks to campaigners and scientists flagging the importance of women’s involvement in research, and the collection of data about menstruation.\nNo matter when you went to school, this new world of menstrual awareness takes some navigating, and may include some concepts that you haven’t come across before.\nHere, we’ll go over how hormones interact in a menstruating woman who isn’t on any kind of hormonal contraception, and how these interactions change throughout her cycle.\nWhat are hormones? \n\nHormones are chemicals that direct parts of your body to behave in certain ways. \nHormones relating to your cycle and fertility are known as ‘sex hormones’, and these include ones you might have heard of, such as oestrogen, progesterone and testosterone, as well as other less-well-known hormones, such as Follicle Stimulating Hormone and Lutenising Hormone. \nEach of these hormones is created in different places around the body, including the glands, the ovaries and the uterus, and some may act as a signal to other parts of the body to start creating a different hormone in order to control a process. \n\n\n\nYour menstrual cycle explained \nWhile period trackers have proved invaluable to many women in recent years, ovulation tracking is only just starting to gain popularity, and not only among women who are trying to conceive; understanding our ovulation patterns can actually give us insight into the rest of  our cycle.\nThough this process is clearly a cycle, it also has two distinct parts: the phase before ovulation when the uterus is gearing up to ovulate and prepare the lining for a fertilised egg, and the phase after ovulation when the uterus maintains its lining for any fertilised eggs to implant in.\nFollicular phase \nThe follicular phase takes place before ovulation, and its start is signalled by the beginning of a period. Both progesterone and oestrogen are low at the start of this phase, and increase as it progresses.\nIn women, oestrogen is mainly produced in the ovaries, though its production is controlled by the release of other hormones made in the pituitary gland. Estradiol is the main oestrogen responsible for the menstrual cycle, and its levels increase during the first ten days. When estradiol is detected in the lining of the uterus (aka endometrium), the lining is stimulated to grow and thicken.\nFollicular development \nA follicle is a tiny bag of fluid within your ovary. Each follicle contains just one egg, which it stores until it’s mature.\nIn the 10-20 days before ovulation, Follicular Stimulating Hormone, produced in the pituitary gland (a bean-shaped gland in the base of the brain) has an X-Factor moment and selects only the most advanced follicle to proceed to ovulation3. This chosen follicle sets off a hormonal chain reaction that results in ovulation (unfortunately not a contract with Simon Cowell and a nationwide tour).\nFollicular Stimulating Hormone is kept in check by progesterone and oestrogen, and when these two hormones fall during menstruation, it takes its chance and rises, stimulating the most advanced follicle in the ovary to mature4. When the follicle reaches a certain size, it starts to release large amounts of an oestrogen called estradiol, which triggers a ‘Luteinising Hormone surge’, which occurs 34-36 hours before ovulation.\nLuteinising Hormone is also made in the pituitary gland, and it is this hormone that signals to the follicle to release the egg, resulting in ovulation. Luteinising Hormone then signals to the remains of the follicle, now an empty structure known as the ‘Corpus Luteum’, to release progesterone.\n\nOvulatory phase \nDuring ovulation, the follicle breaks open and releases the mature egg into the fallopian tube. A new follicle needs around 120 days to reach maturity, but while many follicles begin this process, usually just one makes it to full maturity and ovulation2.\nThis egg stays alive for 12-24 hours, and if it doesn’t get fertilised by sperm, it is simply flushed out of the body. We generally ovulate in the middle of our cycle, though this varies between individuals1.\nLuteal phase \nAfter ovulation, progesterone released by the Corpus Luteum works on reducing estradiol, stopping the growth and thickening of the lining of the uterus. Progesterone, however, maintains the thickness of the lining, and its levels remain high until the Corpus Luteum starts to disintegrate.\nIf the egg is not fertilised, and it does not implant in the lining of the uterus, then the Corpus Luteum breaks down from day 9 after ovulation5. This means that levels of progesterone fall, leading to the breakdown of the uterine lining, which – you guessed it – leaves the body as a period. \nAt the end of the luteal phase, the lining of the uterus starts to break down, causing a period to start, and this wonderful cycle begins all over again.\n",

        "Content": "\nEver looked at the ingredients of your contraception and wished you knew what they were? We’re here to help\nWhat is Synthetic Progestin?\nEvery method of hormonal contraception contains one of a dozen of so synthetic (or man made) progestins, each of which work in various ways to stop pregnancy. \nUltimately, progestins work on their own or alongside synthetic oestrogens to do the following:\n\nPrevent ovulation – although there’s a pretty big variation between different progestins and not all of them do this.\nAffect the production of cervical fluid – ensuring it is not ‘fertile quality’, and instead is too thick for sperm to pass through. This stops sperm from entering the uterus. \nEnsuring the lining of the uterus remains too thin – for a fertilised egg to implant into1.  \n\nDepending on how a progestin binds with progesterone-receptors, androgens, sex hormone binding gobulin, and mineralocorticoid or glucocorticoid receptors2 affects how it works.  \nProgestins can interact with other hormones and our natural biological system in loads of different ways, which means their side effects can be hard to predict. This is particularly the case when progestins are combined with synthetic oestrogens, as the two hormones can interact with each other in highly individual ways. \nPast research is limited and, for the most part, a bit rubbish; many of the studies carried out on progestins involved rats and rabbits, with the results then extrapolated to humans (not very helpful). Another spanner in the works is the way that your life stage can influence your reaction to progestins; they behave differently in pre- and post-menopausal women2. \nGenerational differences\nAs different progestins affect the body in widely different ways, and because their side effects are so varied, the past few decades have seen a large number developed in the hope of designing a more beneficial synthetic progesterone.\nThe need for a synthetic progestin came when scientists discovered that natural progesterone, when taken orally, is ineffective as it is processed by the liver 3,4, meaning a suitable alternative had to be found.\nThe generations of progestin\n\n",

        "Title": "Getting used to new contraception &#8211; is the 3 month rule real?",
        "Content": "\nThe time frame that’s nearly always stated? 3 months. With most health practitioners suggesting a check-up appointment after the first 12 weeks, it’s often assumed by this point your body would have adapted to whatever the form of contraception is. \nHowever, is this time frame based on data or an arbitrary number plucked from the air? Much like lots of issues surrounding contraception, the waters are a little murky (thanks gender health gap) but there certainly is some interesting research in this area.\nHere, we dive into whether waiting 3 months is really the golden rule when deciding whether a contraception is right for you. \nWhere did the 3 month rule originate from? \nWhen it comes to hormonal contraception, the general consensus is that it takes around 3 menstrual cycles for the body to adjust to the change in hormones.\nWhether you opt for a Progestogen only form of contraception (the Mini Pill, Hormonal Coil, Injection or Implant) or one that uses Oestrogen and Progestogen (the Combined Pill, Patch or Vaginal Ring), the shift in hormones in your body can cause side effects.\nMost commonly, these are nausea, headaches, tender breasts, emotional fluctuations and unscheduled bleeding (aka spotting in between monthly bleeds). \nWhat scientific evidence is there to support this?\nResearch shows that side effects (in particular, bloating, nausea, and breast tenderness) usually subside within the first 3 months1. One study looking specifically at spotting for women on the hormonal contraceptive pill – the inconvenient bleeding throughout your cycle – cue extra laundry – found that it was much more present in the first 3 months. \nBetween 30% and 60% of women reported bleeding between monthly bleeds during the first 3 months but this decreased to 10-30% after the 3 month mark had passed2. In another study of 196 women, 24% reported breakthrough vaginal spotting during the first 3 months but this rate decreased to 4% during the last 3 months of use3.\nThere is similar evidence when it comes to the hormonal implant. Research looking at Implanon (one brand on the market) found that half of users experienced infrequent bleeding during the first three months but this decreased to 30% by the sixth month4.\nIt’s not just hormone-based contraception that can take some getting used to, the Copper Coil (known to doctors as an Intrauterine Device or IUD) can also cause initial issues. The Copper Coil works by releasing copper into the womb instead of a hormone like Progestogen used in the hormonal coil (known as the Intrauterine System or IUS). Research suggests that 70% of women using the copper coil will experience spotting and heavier bleeds during the first six months of having the coil inserted5. \nRiding out the first 3 months (or maybe even longer with the copper coil) is therefore a logical option for most women. After this time period, if the side effects are still present, it may be worth discussing these with your doctor or nurse.\n“Remember these are synthetic hormones therefore, it makes sense that there will be a period of adjustment for the body to familiarise itself. Most studies have shown that unscheduled or irregular bleeding is more likely in the first cycle, and that improvement is seen over the first 3 months. Therefore, it makes sense to recommend that women experiencing this to continue their method of contraception for at least 3 months before seeking advice,” GP Dr Hannah Davies confirms. \nDoes the body get used to hormonal contraception?\nFor the majority of women, their body will adapt to the additional hormones (or copper in the case of the coil) either quite quickly or by the end of the first three months.\nFor those where it doesn’t, a discussion with your doctor or nurse can help you work out whether continuing or changing your contraception is right for you. Some symptoms may also warrant further investigation by your doctor.\n“Hormone levels in the blood may vary 10-fold between individuals, so what works for one woman may not work for another,” Davies points out. \nDo you always need to wait 3 months to get used to hormonal contraception? \nSome symptoms require immediate medical attention. There’s an easy anagram to remember here: ACHES. If you notice any of the below, consult your doctor. \n\nAbdominal or stomach pain (severe)\nChest pain (severe), cough, shortness of breath, coughing blood\nHeadache (severe), dizziness, weakness, or numbness\nEye problems (vision loss or blurring), speech problems\nSevere leg pain (calf or thigh)\n\nOtherwise, waiting around 3 months to see if the contraception works for you is probably your best bet. In the meantime, you can try a number of methods to manage your symptoms. \nHow to deal with side effects of new contraception\n\nMake a diary \n\nGrab a notepad or use an app in your phone to document the side effects you’re experiencing alongside the calendar dates. When you’re busy it’s easy to forget how long something has been going on for. If you do decide to change contraception, you can take this information to discuss with your health practitioner. \n\nUse pain relief\n\nPain medication might be needed to deal with headaches or additional cramps.\n\nEat healthily and move more\n\nPacking your plate with nutritious food and exercising where possible is likely to put your body in the best possible position to deal with the changes. \n\nFind ways to stress less\n\nEasier said than done, but high levels of stress may also intensify side effects. Try to incorporate a meditation or gentle yoga practise into your day and make time for self-care activities like a long phone call with a friend or a quiet night in in front of Netflix.  \nSo to summarise\n\nThe thinking behind the ‘3 month rule’ is that it takes around 3 menstrual cycles for your body to adapt to the change in hormone levels caused by contraception\nResearch shows that in most cases women’s side effects settle down after 3 months \nScience indicates that the body will get used to the new hormone levels after 3 months – if not, it may be worth speaking to your doctor or nurse and considering whether to change your contraception \nSome symptoms need urgent medical attention such as severe chest or leg pain\nThe initial side effects of adjusting to contraception can be dealt with via pain relief and lifestyle changes \n\n",
